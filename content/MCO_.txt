a legal and regulatory risks 

moody’s faces risks related to us laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry and moody’s customers 

moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us including the reform act and the doddfrank act these regulations are complex continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time additionally potential changes in congress may increase the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in these laws and regulations and the enforcement of any new or existing legislation or directives by government authorities see “regulation” in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information the current laws and regulations 

– seek to encourage and may result in increased competition among cras and in the credit rating business 

– may result in alternatives to credit ratings or changes in the pricing of credit ratings 

– restrict the use of information in the development or maintenance of credit ratings 

– increase regulatory oversight of the credit markets and cra operations 

– provide the sec with direct jurisdiction over cras that seek nrsro status and grant authority to the sec to inspect the operations of cras and 

– provide for enhanced oversight standards and specialized pleading standards which may result in increases in the number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities and aggregate legal defense costs 

if these laws and regulations and any future rulemaking or court rulings reduce demand for credit ratings or increase costs moody’s may be unable to pass such costs through to customers in addition there may be uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations the company’s compliance and efforts to mitigate the risk of fines penalties or other sanctions can result in significant expenses legal proceedings that are increasingly lengthy can result in uncertainty over and exposure to liability 

it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on moody’s business and its customers’ businesses for example new laws and regulations may affect mis’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which mis’s credit ratings are developed assigned and communicated affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate impact the demand for mis’s credit ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business including by restricting or mandating business models for cras further speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect moody’s stock price although these legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to cras and credit markets generally they may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner each of these developments increases the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and can have a material adverse effect on moody’s operations profitability and competitiveness the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized

in addition ma derives a significant amount of its sales from banks and other financial services providers who are subject to regulatory oversight us banking regulators including the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the consumer financial protection board as well as many state agencies have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with thirdparty relationships which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity by contract or otherwise and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider’s business arrangement with thirdparty service providers and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their thirdparty relationships in light of this ma’s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought to and may further revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with ma this can result in delayed or reduced sales to such customers adversely affect ma’s relationship with such customers increase the costs of doing business with such customers andor result in ma assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers 

moody’s faces risks related to financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry and moody’s customers 

in addition to the extensive and evolving us laws and regulations governing the industry foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to regulate cras and the markets for credit ratings in particular the eu has adopted a common regulatory framework for cras operating in the eu and continues to monitor the credit rating industry and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation credit ratings emanating from outside the eu are subject to esma’s oversight if they are endorsed into the eu additionally other foreign jurisdictions have recently taken measures to increase regulation of cras and markets for credit ratings see “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information 

the eu and other jurisdictions as discussed further below adopt legislation and engage in rulemaking on an ongoing basis that significantly impacts operations and the markets for the companys products and services future laws and regulations could extend to products and services not currently regulated these regulations could i affect the need for debt securities to be rated ii expand supervisory remits to include credit ratings issued outside the home jurisdiction and used for regulatory purposes iii increase the level of competition in the market for credit ratings iv establish criteria for credit ratings or limit the entities authorized to provide credit ratings v restrict the collection use accuracy correction and sharing of personal information by cras or vi regulate pricing for example to require that fees that are based on costs and are nondiscriminatory on products and services provided by ma such as those products that incorporate credit ratings and research originated by mis future regulations could also affect products and services the company offers in the esg sector including those offered by moody’s esg solutions group 

additionally as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form 10k there remains uncertainty regarding the future impact that brexit will have on the credit rating industry within the uk the eu and other jurisdictions following the brexit implementation period that ended december 31 2020 the mis uk registered cra ceased to be registered with and regulated by esma and became subject to regulation by the uk financial conduct authority regulatory arrangements put in place in both the uk and the eu allow credit ratings to be available for regulatory use in both the eu and the uk after the end of the brexitimplementation period mis has put arrangements in place to endorse its uk credit ratings into the eu and its eu credit ratings into the uk on december 31 2020 the uk also onshored cra regulation with certain necessary modifications into uk domestic law the “uk cra regulation” the uk cra regulation contains requirements for the registration regulation and supervision of cras based in the uk it also sets out the circumstances in which uk financial institutions can use credit ratings for regulatory purposes as well as specific obligations for issuers originators and sponsors relating to structured finance instruments it is unclear how the eu cra regulation and the uk cra regulation will differ over time 

both of moody’s segments face risks related to financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry and moody’s customers mis is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic or other inspections in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions such as but not limited to hong kong and china where it operates through registered subsidiaries for example 

– in the eu and the uk applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to credit ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for credit ratings of resecuritizations and restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed additional procedural and substantive requirements include conditions for the issuance of credit ratings rules regarding the organization of cras restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest including fees that are based on costs and are nondiscriminatory and special requirements for credit ratings of structured finance instruments 

28 moodys 2021 10k 

table of contents 

– in hong kong applicable rules include liability for the intentional or negligent dissemination of false and misleading information and procedural requirements for the notification of certain matters to regulators in addition mis hong kong is subject to a code of conduct applicable to cras that imposes procedural and substantive requirements on the preparation and issuance of credit ratings restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest including the disclosure of its compensation arrangements with rated entities and special requirements for credit ratings of structured finance instruments a failure to comply with these procedural and substantive requirements also exposes mis hong kong to the risk of regulatory enforcement action which could result in financial penalties or in serious cases affect its ability to conduct credit rating activities in hong kong 

– in china while mis is not a licensed cra it does issue global credit ratings from offices outside of china regarding chinese issuers in addition the company holds a 30 investment in a cra licensed in china china has laws applicable to domestic cras as well as foreign investment in such entities and entities in general including national security review such laws are broadly crafted and the implementation and interpretation of such laws are subject to the broad discretion of chinese regulators which could affect our ability to conduct business in china 

– in addition us economic sanctions have increasingly targeted chinese persons in response china issued a blocking statute that establishes a framework for limiting the effect of foreign sanctions on chinese persons blocking statutes typically create conflicts of law an entity that is subject to conflicting laws in multiple jurisdictions may need to determine a means to comply with such laws such conflicts could eventually affect the ability of entities to adhere to applicable laws 

with respect to ma regulators in europe and other foreign markets in which ma is active have issued guidance similar to that issued in the us relating to financial institutions’ assessment and management of risks associated with thirdparty relationships in light of this ma’s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought and may further revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with ma this can result in delayed or reduced sales to such customers adversely affect ma’s relationship with such customers increase the costs of doing business with such customers andor result in ma assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers 

although moody’s will monitor developments related to financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry and moody’s customers moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations and the effect that they will have on moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant for example compliance with the eu uk and other foreign regulations may increase costs of operations and could have a significant negative effect on moody’s operations profitability or ability to compete or the markets for its products and services including in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict in addition exposure to increased liability under the eu uk regulations and regulations of other foreign jurisdictions may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact moody’s results of operations financial reforms in the eu uk and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company faces exposure to litigation and government regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to rating opinions and other business practices 

moody’s faces exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to mis’s ratings actions as well as other business practices and products within both mis and ma if the market value of creditdependent instruments declines or defaults whether as a result of difficult economic times turbulent markets or otherwise the number of investigations and legal proceedings that moody’s faces could increase significantly parties who invest in securities rated by mis may pursue claims against mis or moody’s for losses they face in their portfolios for instance moody’s faced numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation government investigations and inquiries concerning events linked to the us subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during the financial crisis of 20072008 evolving expectations on esg disclosures and reporting could also result in new regulatory actions at a corporate and business unit level legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time to addressing other business issues and any of these proceedings investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments damages fines penalties or activity restrictions risks relating to legal proceedings are heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the us in addition new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time furthermore when moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by moody’s increase substantially as does the risk of an adverse outcome 

moodys 2021 10k 29 

table of contents 

additionally as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses moody’s will continue to review the latest information available and may change its accounting estimates which could require moody’s to record or increase liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the company currently faces due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought there is a risk that moody’s will be subject to judgments settlements fines penalties or other adverse results that have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related to its compliance and risk management programs 

moody’s operates in a number of countries and as a result the company is required to comply with and quickly adapt to numerous international and us federal state and local laws and regulations the company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations including anticorruption antitrust and securities trading laws is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel moody’s policies and procedures to identify evaluate and manage the company’s risks including risks resulting from acquisitions may not be fully effective and moody’s employees or agents may engage in misconduct fraud or other errors it is not always possible to deter such errors and the precautions the company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases if moody’s employees violate its policies or if the company’s risk management methods are not effective the company may be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of the company’s employees fines penalties regulatory sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or other penalties and may suffer harm to its reputation financial condition and operating results 

moody’s faces risks related to protecting its intellectual property rights 

moody’s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary failure to protect the company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the company’s ability to compete effectively businesses the company acquires also involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges the company faces in protecting its strategic advantage in addition the company’s operating results can be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets the lack of strong legal and technological intellectual property protections in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may increase our vulnerability and may pose risks to our business from time to time laws are passed that require publication of certain information in some cases at no cost that the company considers to be its intellectual property and that it currently sells or licenses for a fee which could result in lost revenue 

unauthorized third parties may also try to obtain and use technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary it is also possible that moody’s competitors or other entities could obtain patents related to the types of products and services that moody’s offers and attempt to require moody’s to stop developing or marketing the products or services to modify or redesign the products or services to avoid infringing or to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services even if moody’s attempts to assert or protect its intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful the company’s ability to establish maintain and protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights against theft misappropriation or infringement could be materially and adversely affected by insufficient andor changing proprietary rights and intellectual property legal protections in some jurisdictions and markets these risks and the cost time and resources needed to address them may increase as the company’s business grows and its profile rises in countries with intellectual property regimes that are less protective than the rules and regulations applied in the united states 

moody’s faces risks related to tax matters including changes in tax rates or tax rules 

as a global company moody’s is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries and jurisdictions as a result our effective tax rate is determined based on the taxable income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates moody’s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where moody’s faces higher tax rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which moody’s is not able to realize the related tax benefit or changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in the tax accounting and other laws treaties regulations policies and administrative practices or changes to their interpretation or enforcement including changes applicable to multinational corporations such as the base erosion profit shifting initiative being led by the organization for economic cooperation and development which requires companies to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world and the european union’s state aid rulings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition and may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries

for example the tax act made significant changes to the us federal tax laws many aspects of the legislation remain uncertain or unclear as additional regulatory guidance is issued interpreting or clarifying the tax act or if the tax accounting rules are modified there may be adjustments or changes to the company’s determination of its mandatory onetime deemed repatriation tax liability “transition tax” on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries recorded in 2017 additional regulatory guidance may also affect the company’s expected future effective tax rates and tax assets and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition furthermore the tax act may impact the volume of debt securities issued as discussed in the risk factor changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment levels and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets can negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business  

in addition moody’s is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities around the world and the company is experiencing increased scrutiny as its business grows globally moody’s regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits however developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect the company although the company believes its tax estimates and accruals are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its income tax provisions accruals and unrecognized tax benefits which could materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows and financial condition 

b risks relating to our business 

the company is exposed to legal economic operational and regulatory risks of operating in multiple jurisdictions 

moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the company operates have an impact on the company’s business for example economic uncertainty in the eurozone or elsewhere including but not limited to in latin america or china affects the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas in addition to the risks addressed elsewhere in this section operations abroad expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as 

– exposure to exchange rate movements between foreign currencies and usd 

– restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into usd and the costs including the tax impact of repatriating cash held by entities outside the us 

– us laws affecting overseas operations including domestic and foreign export and import restrictions tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions such as those related to the us’s relationship with china and embargoes and sanctions laws with respect to russia and venezuela 

– differing and potentially conflicting legal or civil liability compliance and regulatory standards including as a result of brexit 

– uncertainty about the future relationship between the uk and the eu 

– current and future regulations relating to the imposition of mandatory rotation requirements on cras hired by issuers of securities 

– uncertain and evolving laws and regulations including those applicable to the financial services industries such as the european union’s implementation of the markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii in january 2018 and to the protection of intellectual property

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment levels and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets can negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the us and world financial markets furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional cras such as mis a majority of moody’s creditratingbased revenue is transactionbased and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past and may in the future negatively impact the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings changes to us tax laws and policy can negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued in the us for example the tax act limits deductibility on interest payments and significantly reduces the tax cost associated with the repatriation of cash held outside the us both of which could negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued conditions that reduce issuers’ ability or willingness to issue debt securities such as market volatility declining growth currency devaluations or other adverse economic trends reduce the number and dollarequivalent volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees moody’s earns in its ratings business 

economic and government factors such as the scaling back winddown or termination of covid19 economic stimulus and support programs a longterm continuation of difficult economic conditions and current uncertainty in various other jurisdictions may have an adverse impact on the company’s business future debt issuances also could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates the withdrawal of covid19 economic stimulus inflationary pressures widening credit spreads regulatory and political developments growth in the use of alternative sources of credit and defaults by significant issuers declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient and cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term due in part to rent technology compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further costreduction initiatives including those undertaken to date could make it difficult for the company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings volatility in the financial markets including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition which the company may not be able to successfully offset with cost reductions 

the company faces increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

there is price competition in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets as well as in the market for research business intelligence and analytical services offered by ma moody’s faces competition globally from other cras and from investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions in research as well as from inhouse research operations competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services as well as increased competition from nonnrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors at the same time a challenging business environment and consolidation among both competitors and customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and commercial real estate and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and reduce the company’s customer base weak economic growth intensifies competitive pricing pressures and can result in customers’ use of free or lowercost information that is available from alternative sources or their development of alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk that replace the products currently purchased from moody’s while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services it can lose market share when its pricing is not sufficiently competitive in addition the reform act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies the formation of additional nrsros may increase pricing and competitive pressures furthermore in some of the countries in which moody’s operates governments may provide financial or other support to local rating agencies any inability of moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services will have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to reputation and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business will be significantly impacted factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities the timing and nature of changes in ratings a major compliance failure negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings regulators and legislative bodies including as to the ratings process including as to the company’s recent esg initiatives and its implementation with respect to one or more securities and intentional poor representation of our products and services by our partners or agents manipulation of our products and services by third parties or unintentional misrepresentations of moody’s products and services in advertising materials public relations information social media or other external communications operational errors whether by moody’s or a moody’s competitor could also harm the reputation of the company or the credit rating industry damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on moody’s business operating results and financial condition as well as on the company’s ability to find suitable candidates for acquisition

the introduction of competing products technologies or services by other companies can negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

the markets for credit ratings research credit risk management services business intelligence and analytical services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer and investor demands and evolving regulatory requirements industry standards and market preferences the ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain innovative products technologies and services that anticipate customers’ and investors’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends in a timely and costeffective manner is a key factor in maintaining market share moody’s competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources brand recognition market experience and technological expertise and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may position price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by moody’s moody’s also competes indirectly against consulting firms and technology and information providers some of whom are also suppliers to moody’s these indirect competitors could in the future choose to compete directly with moody’s cease doing business with moody’s or change the terms under which they do business with moody’s in a way that could negatively impact our business in addition customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and services and its growth prospects further the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive internet information may reduce the demand for moody’s products and services moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors any inability of moody’s to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s is exposed to risks related to loss of skilled employees and related compensation cost pressures 

moody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing industries rising expenses including wage inflation could adversely affect moody’s ability to attract and retain highquality employees as greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies in the future moody’s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis we could also fail to effectively respond to evolving perceptions and goals of those in our workforce or whom we might seek to hire including in response to changes brought on by the covid19 pandemic with respect to flexible working or other matters additionally relocation andor restaffing of employees due to brexit could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain talent for our european operations there is a risk that even when the company invests significant resources in attempting to attract train and retain qualified personnel it will not succeed in its efforts and its business could be harmed further employee expectations in areas such as environmental social matters and corporate governance esg have been rapidly evolving and increasing a failure to adequately meet employee expectations may result in an inability to attract and retain talented employees 

moody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of robert fauber the president and chief executive officer and other senior officers and key employees the loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions or investments may not produce anticipated results exposing the company to future significant impairment charges relating to its goodwill intangible assets or property and equipment 

moody’s regularly evaluates and enters into acquisitions dispositions or other strategic transactions and investments to strengthen its business and grow the company for example moody’s acquired bureau van dijk in 2017 reis in 2018 regulatory datacorp rdc in 2020 and rms in september 2021 such transactions and investments present significant challenges and risks the company faces intense competition for acquisition targets especially in light of industry consolidation which may affect moody’s ability to complete such transactions on favorable terms or at all additionally the company makes significant investments in technology including software for internal use which can be expensive timeintensive and complex to develop and implement

table of contents 

the anticipated growth synergies and other strategic objectives of the rms acquisition as well as other completed transactions may not be fully realized and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions any strategic transaction involves a number of risks including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations technologies and new employees the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the company prior to closing a transaction unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures scrutiny from competition and antitrust authorities failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business future developments that impair the value of purchased goodwill or intangible assets diversion of management’s focus from other business operations failure to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls procedures and policies disputes or litigation arising out of acquisitions or dispositions challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business coordination of product sales marketing and program and systems management functions integration of employees from the acquired business into moody’s organization integration of the acquired business’s accounting information technology human resources legal and other administrative systems with moody’s risks that acquired systems expose us to cybersecurity risks and for foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction or investment may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected as a result the failure of acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions and investments to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

at december 31 2021 moody’s had 5999 million of goodwill and 2467 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet approximately 94 of the goodwill and intangible assets reside in the ma business including those related to bureau van dijk and rms and are allocated to the two reporting units within ma the remaining 6 of goodwill and intangible assets reside in mis and primarily relate to icra failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in a significant asset impairment charge which would result in a noncash charge to operating expenses goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be especially difficult in periods of market or economic uncertainty and turmoil and requires significant management estimates and judgment in addition the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty an asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the global covid19 pandemic may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance and is having a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of many of our customers it is difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will adversely impact our business operations financial performance results of operations financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives 

our operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted by the continued effects of the covid19 pandemic that has caused and is expected to continue to cause the global slowdown of economic activity and significant volatility and disruption in financial markets because the severity magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its economic consequences continue to be uncertain and difficult to predict the pandemic’s impact on our operations and financial performance as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives remains uncertain and difficult to predict further the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our operations and financial performance as well as the performance of our customers depends on many factors that are not within our control including but not limited to governmental business and individuals’ actions including restrictions on travel and workforce pressures actions taken in response on global and regional economies travel and economic activity the availability of federal state local or nonus funding programs general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility global economic conditions and levels of economic growth uncertainty presented by approved vaccines corresponding rollout and unanticipated consequences of such vaccines and the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides 

the covid19 pandemic has subjected our operations and financial performance to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below 

– the global credit market disruptions and economic stimulus measures led to robust us investment grade and us speculative grade issuance that may not continue as government programs are scaled back 

– we continue to publish research and issue credit ratings in accordance with our public credit rating methodologies in a highly uncertain changing environment given these unprecedented events and our prior experience during periods of volatility and economic uncertainty it is likely that our ratings and research will be challenged and scrutinized around the globe and result in future government and regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries and litigation 

– likewise ma continues to offer quantitative analytics in a highly uncertain rapidly changing environment where it is difficult to accurately capture the impact of the covid19 pandemic within its analytical models across different business sectors and geographies any failure of ma’s models to sufficiently account for covid19 impacts may impact mas reputation brand and credibility and could result in customer dissatisfaction andor contract cancellations 

– illness travel restrictions or workforce disruptions could result in reduced sales opportunities for both mis and ma the covid19 pandemic may decrease demand for the financial intelligence and analytical tools ma provides

– our customers are being impacted and will be impacted by the covid19 pandemic to differing degrees as a result we may face pricing pressure on our products delayed renewals for certain subscription based products and challenges to new sales which would in turn reduce revenue ultimately impacting our results of operations 

– the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility in the capital markets the company might not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like and our borrowing costs could increase 

– while we have transitioned to a hybrid work environment combining remote and inoffice work all employees globally maintaining such a state for an extended period of time may have a material adverse effect on our productivity our ability to meet the needs of our customers and may expose us to both operational and security risks in addition maintaining an infrastructure that supports a prolonged remote working environment may limit information technology resources available for other projects 

– as the covid19 pandemic continues to affect the global economy it may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks such as those surrounding cybersecurity described in our risk factors in this form 10k further the covid19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our operations or financial results 

c technology risks 

the company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees in the company’s computer systems and networks and in those of its third party vendors unauthorized disclosure of this information could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect their confidential information and therefore cause customers to cease doing business with us the risks the company faces range from cyberattacks common to most industries to more advanced threats that target the company because of its prominence in the global marketplace or due to its ratings of sovereign debt breaches of moody’s or moody’s vendors’ technology and systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks some of which may be carried out by statesponsored actors hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data material interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s or such vendors’ web sites or systems applications data processing or disruption of other business operations or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the company including information about moody’s business employees or customers as well as sensitive personally identifiable information pii the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft measures that moody’s takes to avoid detect mitigate or recover from material incidents can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or may become ineffective additionally the company may be exposed to additional threats as the company migrates its data from legacy systems to cloudbased solutions and increased dependence on third parties to store cloudbased data subjects the company to further cyber risks further as a result of the covid19 pandemic many of our employees are working remotely which magnifies the importance of the integrity of our remote access security measures and may expose the company to additional cyber risks 

the company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security measures in order to protect its systems and data including employee training disaster plans and technical defenses the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threats despite the company’s best efforts it is not fully insulated from and has in the past experienced security threats and system disruptions although past incidents have not had a material adverse effect on the companys operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future because the methods used for these systems cyberattacks are rapidly changing the company despite significant focus and investment may be unable to anticipatedeploy sufficient protections against such incidents further the extent of a particular security incident and the steps needed to investigate may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident including the extent of the harm and how best to remediate it is known recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity compliance requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers cybersecurity incidents including the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data could cause reputational harm loss of customers and revenue fines regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard the company’s customers’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company in addition disclosure or media reports of actual or perceived security vulnerabilities to the company’s systems or those of the company’s third parties even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could lead to reputational harm loss of customers and revenue or increased regulatory actions oversight and scrutiny 

any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition

the company is exposed to risks related to protection of confidential information 

to conduct its operations the company regularly moves data across national borders and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security such as the federal trade commission act in the united states the general data protection regulation “gdpr” in the european union the cyber security law in china and various other international federal state and local laws and regulations the scope of the laws that may be applicable to moody’s is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example gdpr which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union privacy law and added a broad array of requirements for processing personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue additionally other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders further laws such as the california consumer privacy act enacted in january 2020 require among other things covered companies to provide new disclosures to consumers and affords consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information the effects of noncompliance with the ccpa and other similar data privacy laws in other jurisdictions are significant however and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur additional costs and expenses all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements have required changes to certain business practices thereby increasing costs requiring significant management time and attention and subjecting the company to negative publicity as well as remedies that may harm its business including fines modified demands or orders the cessation of existing business practices and exposure to litigation regulatory actions sanctions or other statutory penalties 

the company is dependent on the use of thirdparty software data hosted solutions data centers cloud and network infrastructure together “third party technology” and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or service offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

moody’s relies on third party technology in connection with its product development and offerings and operations the company depends on the ability of third party technology providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis provide data necessary to develop and maintain its products and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the third party technology moody’s uses can become obsolete or restrictive incompatible with future versions of the company’s products fail to be comprehensive or accurate unavailable or fail to operate effectively including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and moody’s business could be adversely affected when the company is unable to timely or effectively replace such third party technology 

the company also monitors its use of third party technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements despite the company’s efforts the company cannot ensure that such third parties will permit moody’s use in the future resulting in increased third party technology acquisition costs and loss of rights in addition the company’s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for third party technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to third party technology are substantial in the ordinary course our thirdparties including our vendors are subject to various forms of cyber attacks to date such attacks have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business operations but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact some of these thirdparty suppliers are also moody’s competitors increasing the risks noted above when any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its critical accounting estimates actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

on july 31st of each year moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment ie mis and ma or one level below an operating segment ie a component of an operating segment 

prior to the second quarter of 2021 mas reporting unit structure consisted of five reporting units content ers mals bureau van dijk and reis pursuant to a strategic reorganization in the ma segment which was completed in the second quarter of 2021 mas reporting unit structure has been reorganized into two reporting units ma’s two new reporting units generally consist of i businesses offering data and datadriven analytical solutions and ii riskmanagement software workflow and cre solutions this reorganization did not result in a change to the companys reportable segments 

the company performed qualitative assessments of the reporting units impacted by the reorganization immediately before and after the reorganization became effective these qualitative assessments resulted in the company determining that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount 

subsequent to the aforementioned reorganization of the ma reporting units the company now has four reporting units two within the company’s ratings business one for the icra business and one that encompasses all of moody’s other ratings operations and two reporting units within ma consisting of businesses that offer i data and datadriven analytical solutions and ii riskmanagement software workflow and cre solutions

the rms business was acquired on september 15 2021 and 1266 million of goodwill was assigned to the ma reporting unit consisting of riskmanagement software workflow and cre solutions 90 million was assigned to the mis reporting unit and 20 million was assigned to the ma reporting unit consisting of businesses offering data and datadriven analytical solutions in addition the company acquired passfort on november 30 2021 and 138 million of goodwill was assigned to the reporting unit consisting of businesses offering data and datadriven analytical solutions as the acquisitions of these businesses were completed after the companys annual impairment assessment date of july 31 2021 goodwill acquired in these transactions was not subject to the companys impairment assessment described below 

the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a twostep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level in the first step the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount if a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist the company is not required to perform further testing if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the reporting unit will be quantitatively determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach the company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years 

annual goodwill impairment assessment performed at july 31 2021 

at july 31 2021 the company performed quantitative assessments for each of the four reporting units these quantitative assessments were performed to provide new baseline valuations under the aforementioned new reporting unit structure these quantitative assessments resulted in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying value for all reporting units 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions which are more fully described below in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 

matters concerning the icra reporting unit 

icra has reported various matters relating to i an adjudication order and fine imposed and subsequently enhanced by the securities and exchange board of india sebi in connection with credit ratings assigned to one of icra’s customers and the customer’s subsidiaries which are being appealed by icra ii the completion of internal examinations regarding various anonymous complaints and actions taken by icra’s board based on the examinations’ findings and iii a separate internal examination of certain allegations against two former senior icra officials an unfavorable resolution of the aforementioned matters may negatively impact icra’s future operating results which could result in an impairment of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets in future quarters 

methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units 

the following is a discussion regarding the company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units excluding icra at july 31 2021 as icra is a publicly traded company in india the company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization 

the fair value of each reporting unit excluding icra was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples the discounted cash flow analysis requires significant estimates including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit that could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition 

the sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions are described below these key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology require significant management judgment 

– future cash flow assumptions  the projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit these projections are consistent with the company’s operating budget and strategic plan cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment test were utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue based on new customer acquisition and new products beyond five years a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real gdp growth rates a sensitivity

table of contents 

analysis of the revenue growth rates was performed on all reporting units for each reporting unit analyzed a 10 reduction in the revenue growth rates used would not have resulted in its carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value 

– wacc  the wacc is the rate used to discount each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows the wacc is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity the cost of equity is based on a riskfree interest rate and an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit’s cash flows the cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the company’s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the wacc the cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested the wacc for all reporting units ranged from 80 to 85 as of july 31 2021 differences in the wacc used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units a sensitivity analysis of the wacc was performed on all reporting units as of july 31 2021 for each reporting unit for all reporting units an increase in the wacc of one percentage point would not result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value 

longlived assets 

longlived assets which consist primarily of amortizable intangible assets operating lease rou assets and property and equipment are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

under the first step of the recoverability assessment moodys compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group to its carrying value if the undiscounted future cash flows are greater than the carrying value no further assessment is required if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value moodys proceeds with step two of the assessment under step two of this assessment moodys is required to determine the fair value of the asset or asset group and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value in performing this assessment moodys must include assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value including the estimated future cash flows and discount rate moodys must apply judgment in developing estimated future cash flows and in the determination of market participant assumptions 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

for utps asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

revenue recognition and costs to obtain a contract with a customer 

revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services 

the discussion below outlines areas of the company’s revenue recognition process that require significant management judgment and estimates refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive discussion regarding the company’s accounting policies relating to the recognition of revenue and costs to obtain a contract with a customer 

allocating consideration to performance obligations 

management judgment is required in the determination of the ssp which is utilized to allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation at contract inception when the contract includes multiple distinct performance obligations 

in the mis segment the ssp for both ratings and monitoring services is generally based upon directly observable selling prices where the rating or monitoring service is sold separately 

moodys 2021 10k 43 

table of contents 

in the ma segment for performance obligations where an observable price exists such as pcs the observable price is utilized if an observable price does not currently exist the company will utilize management’s best estimate of ssp for that good or service using estimation methods that maximize the use of observable data points 

the ssp in both segments is usually apportioned along the lines of class of customer nature of productservices and other attributes related to those products and services once ssp is determined for each performance obligation the transaction price including any discount is allocated based on the relative ssp of the separate performance obligations 

costs to obtain a contract with a customer 

costs incurred to obtain customer contracts such as sales commissions are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs are determined to be incremental to obtaining a contract would not have been incurred otherwise and the company expects to recover those costs these costs are amortized to expense on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of products or services to the customer for which the asset relates depending on the line of business to which the contract relates this amortization period may be based upon the average economic life of the products sold or average period for which services are provided inclusive of anticipated contract renewals 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities 

for claims litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and periodically adjusts these as appropriate when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range in instances when a loss is reasonably possible but uncertainties exist related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if material as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly moody’s also discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to sec rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate 

in view of the inherent difficulty of assessing the potential outcome of legal proceedings governmental regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries claims and litigation and similar matters and contingencies particularly when the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also may be unable to predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition and to accrue for and disclose such matters as and when required however because such matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur the ultimate outcome of such matters including the amount of any loss may differ from those estimates 

accounts receivable allowances 

on january 1 2020 the company adopted asu no 201613 “financial instruments—credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” as more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as the companys accounts receivable are shortterm in nature the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact to the companys allowance for bad debts or its policies and procedures for determining the allowance 

in order to determine an estimate of expected credit losses receivables are segmented based on similar risk characteristics including historical credit loss patterns and industry or class of customers to calculate reserve rates the company uses an aging method for developing its allowance for credit losses by which receivable balances are grouped based on aging category a reserve rate is calculated for each aging category which is generally based on historical information and is adjusted when necessary for current conditions eg macroeconomic or industry related and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future the company also considers customer specific information eg bankruptcy or financial difficulty when estimating its expected credit losses as well as the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances expected credit losses are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance actual uncollectible account writeoffs are recorded against the allowance 

the impact on operating income relating to a one percentage point change in the companys reserve rates would be approximately 18 million

pension and other retirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these significant assumptions include the following 

– future compensation increases based on the company’s longterm actual experience and future outlook 

– longterm expected return on pension plan assets based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixedincome investments and 

– discount rates based on current yields on highgrade corporate longterm bonds 

the discount rates used to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31 2021 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the ftse pension discount curve the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with thirdparty actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s retirement plans additionally the company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released mortality improvement scale mp2021 to accompany the pri2012 mortality tables to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the society of actuaries 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise excluding differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual returns on plan assets the company amortizes as a component of annual pension expense total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets for moody’s retirement plans the total actuarial losses as of december 31 2021 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 65 million and moody’s expects to recognize a net periodic expense of 4 million in 2022 related to the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded us pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual returns could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under asc topic 715 the company amortizes the impact of asset returns over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2021 the company has an unrecognized asset gain of 44 million of which 13 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of 2022 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2022 income before provision for income taxes these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2022 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s retirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

1 weighted average discount rates of 260 and 265 for pension plans and other retirement plans respectively 

based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be approximately 13 million in 2022 a decrease compared to the 31 million recognized in 2021 

leases 

the company’s operating leases do not provide an implicit interest rate accordingly the company must estimate the secured incremental borrowing rate attributable to the currency in which the lease is denominated in the derivation of operating lease liabilities and related operating lease rou assets this secured incremental borrowing rate is based on the information available at the lease commencement date and is utilized in the determination of the present value of lease payments 

moodys 2021 10k 45 

table of contents 

in addition certain of moody’s leases have the option to extend the lease beyond the initial term or terminate the lease prior to the end of the term for these leases moody’s may be required to exercise significant judgment to determine when that option is reasonably certain of being exercised which will impact the lease term and determination of the lease liability and corresponding rou asset 

investments in nonconsolidated affiliates 

equity method investments are reviewed for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment on a quarterly basis these investments are written down to fair value if there is evidence of a loss in value that is otherthantemporary 

for equity investments without a readily determinable fair value for which the company does not have significant influence moodys generally elects to measure these investments at cost less impairment adjusted for subsequent observable price changes as of the date that an observable transaction takes place 

the company performs an assessment on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment for its investments in nonconsolidated affiliates if there are indicators of impairment the company estimates the investment’s fair value and records an impairment if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 

in situations where estimation of fair value is required for investments in nonconsolidated affiliates the company considers various factors including recent observable investee equity transactions comparable public companyprecedent transaction multiples and discounted cash flow models the estimation of fair value for these investments may involve significant judgment 

other estimates 

in addition to the critical accounting estimates described above there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition

the effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency are charged to other nonoperating income expense net in the company’s consolidated statements of operations accordingly the company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency the following table shows the impact to the fair value of the forward contracts if currencies being purchased were to weaken by 10 

1 refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further detail on the forward contracts 

the change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by fx revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency 

derivatives and nonderivatives designated as net investment hedges 

the company designates derivative instruments and foreign currencydenominated debt as hedges of foreign currency risk of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries net investment hedges under asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging

– crosscurrency swaps to exchange an aggregate amount of €1179 million with corresponding interest based on the floating 3month euribor for an aggregate amount of 1350 million with corresponding interest based on the floating 3month us libor 

if the euro were to strengthen 10 relative to the us dollar there would be an approximate 237 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the crosscurrency swaps recognized in oci which would be offset by favorable currency translation gains on the company’s euro net investment in foreign subsidiaries 

eurodenominated debt

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to its reported results moody’s has included in this mda certain adjusted results that the sec defines as “nongaap financial measures” management believes that such adjusted financial measures when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing periodtoperiod comparisons of the company’s performance facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking these adjusted measures as defined by the company are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies furthermore these adjusted measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other gaap measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the company below are brief descriptions of the company’s adjusted financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the adjusted measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure 

adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin 

the company presents adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on moodys operating performance adjusted operating income excludes the impact of i depreciation and amortization ii restructuring chargesadjustments and iii a loss pursuant to the divestiture of maks depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets restructuring charges are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies the loss pursuant to the divestiture of maks is excluded as the frequency and magnitude of divestiture activity may vary widely from period to period and across companies 

management believes that the exclusion of the aforementioned items as detailed in the reconciliation below allows for an additional perspective on the company’s operating results from period to period and across companies the company defines adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by revenue

adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps attributable to moody’s common shareholders

the company excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different ages and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets these intangible assets were recorded as part of acquisition accounting and contribute to revenue generation the amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized furthermore the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies restructuring charges the noncash gain relating to the companys minority interest in bitsight and the loss pursuant to the divestiture of maks are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these items may vary widely across periods and companies 

the company excludes the aforementioned items to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted eps from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods

impact of technology 

the pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and similarly investors’ ability to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell which in the absence of the appropriate technology might not be readily or easily obtainable this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of both established and newer capital markets as technology provides broader access to worldwide markets it also results in a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk data analytics and related services 




 item 1a risk factors 

please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in the company’s securities risky and provide important information for the understanding of the “forwardlooking” statements discussed in item 7 of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on form 10k 

the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances the company may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on moody’s business financial condition operating results including components of the company’s financial results such as sales and profits cash flows and stock price these risk factors do not identify all risks that moody’s faces the company could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to the company or that the company currently does not consider to present significant risks in addition to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in item 7 of this form 10k and in the risk factors below additional or unforeseen effects from the covid19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks discussed below 

a legal and regulatory risks 

moody’s faces risks related to us laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry and moody’s customers 

moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us including the reform act and the financial reform act these regulations are complex continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time additionally the change in the presidential administration and changes in congress may increase the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in these laws and regulations and the enforcement of any new or existing legislation or directives by government authorities see “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information the current laws and regulations 

– seek to encourage and may result in increased competition among cras and in the credit rating business 

– may result in alternatives to credit ratings or changes in the pricing of credit ratings 

– restrict the use of information in the development or maintenance of credit ratings 

– increase regulatory oversight of the credit markets and cra operations 

– provide the sec with direct jurisdiction over cras that seek nrsro status and grant authority to the sec to inspect the operations of cras and 

– provide for enhanced oversight standards and specialized pleading standards which may result in increases in the number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities and aggregate legal defense costs 

if these laws and regulations and any future rulemaking or court rulings reduce demand for credit ratings or increase costs moody’s may be unable to pass such costs through to customers in addition there may be uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations the company’s compliance and efforts to mitigate the risk of fines penalties or other sanctions can result in significant expenses legal proceedings that are increasingly lengthy can result in uncertainty over and exposure to liability 

it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on moody’s business and its customers’ businesses for example new laws and regulations may affect mis’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which mis’s credit ratings are developed assigned and communicated affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate impact the demand for mis’s credit ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business including by restricting or mandating business models for cras further speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect moody’s stock price although these legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to cras and credit markets generally they may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and can have a material adverse effect on moody’s operations profitability and competitiveness the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized

in addition ma derives a significant amount of its sales from banks and other financial services providers who are subject to regulatory oversight us banking regulators including the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the consumer financial protection board as well as many state agencies have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with thirdparty relationships which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity by contract or otherwise and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider’s business arrangement with thirdparty service providers and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their thirdparty relationships in light of this ma’s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought to and may further revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with ma this can result in delayed or reduced sales to such customers adversely affect ma’s relationship with such customers increase the costs of doing business with such customers andor result in ma assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers 

moody’s faces risks related to financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry and moody’s customers 

in addition to the extensive and evolving us laws and regulations governing the industry foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to regulate cras and the markets for credit ratings in particular the eu has adopted a common regulatory framework for cras operating in the eu and continues to monitor the credit rating industry and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation ratings emanating from outside the eu are subject to esma’s oversight if they are endorsed into the eu additionally other foreign jurisdictions have recently taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and markets for ratings see “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information 

the eu and other jurisdictions as discussed further below adopt legislation and engage in rulemaking on an ongoing basis that significantly impacts operations and the markets for the companys products and services future laws and regulations could extend to products and services not currently regulated these regulations could i affect the need for debt securities to be rated ii expand supervisory remits to include noneu ratings used for regulatory purposes iii increase the level of competition in the market for credit ratings iv establish criteria for credit ratings or limit the entities authorized to provide credit ratings and iv restrict the collection use accuracy correction and sharing of personal information by cras or v regulate pricing such that fees that are based on costs and are nondiscriminatory on products and services provided by ma such as those products that incorporate ratings and research originated by mis future regulations could also affect products and services the company offers in the esg sector including those offered by moody’s esg solutions group 

additionally as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form 10k there remains uncertainty regarding the impact that brexit will have on the credit rating industry within the uk the eu and other jurisdictions the uk left the eu on january 31 2020 thereby entering an 11month implementation period the brexit implementation period ended on december 31 2020 following the brexit implementation period the mis uk registered cra ceased to be registered with and regulated by esma and became subject to regulation by the uk financial conduct authority regulatory arrangements put in place in both the uk and the eu allow credit ratings to be available for regulatory use in both the eu and the uk after the end of the brexitimplementation period mis has put arrangements in place to endorse its uk credit ratings into the eu and its eu credit ratings into the uk the uk and the eu are expected to agree by march 2021 to a memorandum of understanding establishing the framework for structured regulatory cooperation on financial services the contents and extent of the memorandum of understanding are currently unclear and therefore the impact on moody’s customers and other stakeholders is currently uncertain 

both of moody’s segments face risks related to financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry and moody’s customers mis is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic or other inspections in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions such as but not limited to hong kong and china where it operates through registered subsidiaries for example 

– in the eu applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations and restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed additional procedural and substantive requirements include conditions for the issuance of credit ratings rules regarding the organization of cras restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest including fees that are based on costs and are nondiscriminatory and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments

table of contents 

– in hong kong applicable rules include liability for the intentional or negligent dissemination of false and misleading information and procedural requirements for the notification of certain matters to regulators in addition mis hong kong is subject to a code of conduct applicable to cras that impose procedural and substantive requirements on the preparation and issuance of credit ratings restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest including the disclosure of its compensation arrangements with rated entities and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments a failure to comply with these procedural and substantive requirements also exposes mis hong kong to the risk of regulatory enforcement action which could result in financial penalties or in serious cases its ability to conduct credit rating activities in hong kong 

– in china while mis is not a licensed credit rating agency it does issue global credit ratings from offices outside of china regarding chinese issuers in addition the company holds a 30 investment in a credit rating agency licensed in china china has laws applicable to domestic credit rating agencies as well as foreign investment in such entities and entities in general including national security review such laws are broadly crafted and the implementation and interpretation of such laws are subject to the broad discretion of chinese regulators which could affect our ability to conduct business in china 

– in addition us economic sanctions have increasingly targeted chinese persons in response china recently issued a blocking statute that establishes a framework for limiting the effect of foreign sanctions on chinese persons blocking statutes typically create conflicts of law an entity that is subject to conflicting laws in multiple jurisdictions may need to determine a means to comply with such laws such conflicts could eventually affect the ability of entities to adhere to applicable laws 

with respect to ma regulators in europe and other foreign markets in which ma is active have issued guidance similar to that issued in the us relating to financial institutions’ assessment and management of risks associated with thirdparty relationships in light of this ma’s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought and may further revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with ma this can result in delayed or reduced sales to such customers adversely affect ma’s relationship with such customers increase the costs of doing business with such customers andor result in ma assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers 

although moody’s will monitor developments related to financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry and moody’s customers moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations and the effect that they will have on moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant for example compliance with the eu and other foreign regulations may increase costs of operations and could have a significant negative effect on moody’s operations profitability or ability to compete or the markets for its products and services including in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict in addition exposure to increased liability under the eu regulations and regulations of other foreign jurisdictions may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact moody’s results of operations financial reforms in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company faces exposure to litigation and government regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to rating opinions and other business practices 

moody’s faces exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to mis’s ratings actions as well as other business practices and products within both mis and ma if the market value of creditdependent instruments declines or defaults whether as a result of difficult economic times turbulent markets or otherwise the number of investigations and legal proceedings that moody’s faces could increase significantly parties who invest in securities rated by mis may pursue claims against mis or moody’s for losses they face in their portfolios for instance moody’s faced numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation government investigations and inquiries concerning events linked to the us subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during the financial crisis of 20072008 legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time to addressing other business issues and any of these proceedings investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments damages fines penalties or activity restrictions risks relating to legal proceedings are heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the us in addition new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time furthermore when moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by moody’s increase substantially as does the risk of an adverse outcome 

moodys 2020 10k 31 

table of contents 

additionally as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses moody’s will continue to review the latest information available and may change its accounting estimates which could require moody’s to record or increase liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the company currently faces due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought there is a risk that moody’s will be subject to judgments settlements fines penalties or other adverse results that have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related to its compliance and risk management programs 

moody’s operates in a number of countries and as a result the company is required to comply and quickly adapt with numerous international and us federal state and local laws and regulations the company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations including anticorruption antitrust and securities trading laws is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel moody’s policies and procedures to identify evaluate and manage the company’s risks including risks resulting from acquisitions may not be fully effective and moody’s employees or agents may engage in misconduct fraud or other errors it is not always possible to deter such errors and the precautions the company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases if moody’s employees violate its policies or if the company’s risk management methods are not effective the company may be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of the company’s employees fines penalties regulatory sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or other penalties and may suffer harm to its reputation financial condition and operating results 

moody’s faces risks related to protecting its intellectual property rights 

moody’s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary failure to protect the company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the company’s ability to compete effectively businesses the company acquires also involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges the company faces in protecting its strategic advantage in addition the company’s operating results can be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets the lack of strong legal and technological intellectual property protections in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may increase our vulnerability and may pose risks to our business from time to time laws are passed that require publication of certain information in some cases at no cost that the company considers to be its intellectual property and that it currently sells or licenses for a fee which could result in lost revenue 

unauthorized third parties may also try to obtain and use technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary it is also possible that moody’s competitors or other entities could obtain patents related to the types of products and services that moody’s offers and attempt to require moody’s to stop developing or marketing the products or services to modify or redesign the products or services to avoid infringing or to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services even if moody’s attempts to assert or protect its intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful the company’s ability to establish maintain and protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights against theft misappropriation or infringement could be materially and adversely affected by insufficient andor changing proprietary rights and intellectual property legal protections in some jurisdictions and markets these risks and the cost time and resources needed to address them may increase as the company’s business grows and its profile rises in countries with intellectual property regimes that are less protective than the rules and regulations applied in the united states 

moody’s faces risks related to tax matters including changes in tax rates or tax rules 

as a global company moody’s is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries and jurisdictions as a result our effective tax rate is determined based on the taxable income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates moody’s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where moody’s faces higher tax rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which moody’s is not able to realize the related tax benefit or changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in the tax accounting and other laws treaties regulations policies and administrative practices or changes to their interpretation or enforcement including changes applicable to multinational corporations such as the base erosion profit shifting initiative being conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development which requires companies to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world and the european union’s state aid rulings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition and may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries

for example the tax act made significant changes to the us federal tax laws many aspects of the legislation remain uncertain or unclear and may not be clarified for some time as additional regulatory guidance is issued interpreting or clarifying the tax act or if the tax accounting rules are modified there may be adjustments or changes to the company’s determination of its mandatory onetime deemed repatriation tax liability “transition tax” on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries recorded in 2017 additional regulatory guidance may also affect the company’s expected future effective tax rates and tax assets and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition furthermore the tax act may impact the volume of debt securities issued as discussed in the risk factor changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment levels and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business  additionally a change in the presidential administration and changes in congress increase the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in the us federal tax laws and the interpretation or enforcement of legislation or directives by tax authorities 

in addition moody’s is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and the company is experiencing increased scrutiny as its business grows moody’s regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits however developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect the company although the company believes its tax estimates and accruals are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its historical income tax provisions accruals and unrecognized tax benefits which could materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows and financial condition 

b risks relating to our business 

the company is exposed to legal economic operational and regulatory risks of operating in multiple jurisdictions 

moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the company operates have an impact on the company’s business for example economic uncertainty in the eurozone or elsewhere including but not limited to in latin america or china affects the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas in addition to the risks addressed elsewhere in this section operations abroad expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as 

– exposure to exchange rate movements between foreign currencies and usd

– us laws affecting overseas operations including domestic and foreign export and import restrictions tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions such as those related to the us’s relationship with china and embargoes and sanctions laws with respect to russia and venezuela 

– differing and potentially conflicting legal or civil liability compliance and regulatory standards including as a result of brexit 

– uncertainty about the future relationship between the uk and the eu 

– current and future regulations relating to the imposition of mandatory rotation requirements on cras hired by issuers of securities 

– uncertain and evolving laws and regulations including those applicable to the financial services industries such as the european union’s implementation of the markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii in january 2018 and to the protection of intellectual property 

– the transition away from benchmark reference rates based on market participant judgements such as libor and euribor to rates based on observable transactions such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr 

– uncertainty regarding the future relationship between the us and china which may result in further restrictions or actions by the us government with respect to doing business in china andor by the chinese government with respect to business conducted by foreign entities in china 

– economic political and geopolitical market conditions including the effect of these conditions on customers and customer retention

additionally moody’s is subject to complex us foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad such as laws and regulations governing economic and trade sanctions tariffs embargoes and anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the uk bribery act of 2010 and other similar local laws the internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices the company has implemented may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations any determination that the company has violated sanctions antibribery or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on moody’s reputation its ability to attract and retain employees its business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s operations are exposed to risks from infrastructure malfunctions or failures 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located including new york city the location of moody’s headquarters major cities worldwide in which moody’s has offices and locations in china used for certain moody’s work this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure whether or not controlled by the company including the company’s electronic delivery systems data center facilities or the internet used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business many of the company’s products and services are delivered electronically and the company’s customers depend on the company’s ability to receive store process transmit and otherwise rapidly handle very substantial quantities of data and transactions on computerbased networks some of moody’s operations require complex processes and the company’s extensive controls to reduce the risk of error inherent in our operations cannot eliminate such risk completely the company’s customers also depend on the continued capacity reliability and security of the company’s telecommunications data centers networks and other electronic delivery systems including its websites and connections to the internet the company’s employees also depend on these systems for internal use any significant failure compromise cyberbreach interruption or a significant slowdown of operations of the company’s infrastructure whether due to human error capacity constraints hardware failure or defect weather including climate change natural disasters fire power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political unrest pandemic including the covid19 pandemic war or otherwise may impair the company’s ability to deliver its products and services 

moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful the company relies on thirdparty providers including increasingly cloudbased service providers to provide certain essential services while the company believes that such providers are reliable the company has limited control over the performance of such providers to the extent any of the company’s thirdparty providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fails to adequately expand its services to meet the company’s needs and the needs of the company’s customers including as a result of the covid19 pandemic the company could experience lower revenues and higher costs additionally although the company maintains processes to prevent detect and recover from a disruption the company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations such persons’ ability to service and interact with moody’s customers will suffer the company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the company’s failure or the failure of a third party to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions a disruption to moody’s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its reputation business operating results and financial condition

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment levels and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets can negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the us and world financial markets furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional cras such as mis a majority of moody’s creditratingbased revenue is transactionbased and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past and may in the future negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings changes to us tax laws and policy can negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued in the us for example the tax act limits deductibility on interest payments and significantly reduces the tax cost associated with the repatriation of cash held outside the us both of which could negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued conditions that reduce issuers’ ability or willingness to issue debt securities such as market volatility declining growth currency devaluations or other adverse economic trends reduce the number and dollarequivalent volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees moody’s earns in its ratings business 

economic and government factors such as a longterm continuation of difficult economic conditions the scaling back winddown or termination of covid19 economic stimulus and support programs and current uncertainty in various other jurisdictions may have an adverse impact on the company’s business future debt issuances also could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates widening credit spreads regulatory and political developments growth in the use of alternative sources of credit and defaults by significant issuers declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient and cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term due in part to rent technology compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further costreduction initiatives including those undertaken to date could make it difficult for the company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings volatility in the financial markets including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition which the company may not be able to successfully offset with cost reductions 

the company faces increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

there is price competition in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets as well as in the market for research business intelligence and analytical services offered by ma moody’s faces competition globally from other cras and from investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions in research as well as from inhouse research operations competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services as well as increased competition from nonnrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors at the same time a challenging business environment and consolidation among both competitors and customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and commercial real estate and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and reduce the company’s customer base weak economic growth intensifies competitive pricing pressures and can result in customers’ use of free or lowercost information that is available from alternative sources or their development of alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk that replace the products currently purchased from moody’s while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services it can lose market share when its pricing is not sufficiently competitive in addition the reform act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies the formation of additional nrsros may increase pricing and competitive pressures furthermore in some of the countries in which moody’s operates governments may provide financial or other support to local rating agencies any inability of moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services will have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to reputation and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business will be significantly impacted factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities the timing and nature of changes in ratings a major compliance failure negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings regulators and legislative bodies including as to the ratings process including as to the company’s recent esg initiatives and its implementation with respect to one or more securities and intentional poor representation of our products and services by our partners or agents or unintentional misrepresentations of moody’s products and services in advertising materials public relations information social media or other external communications operational errors whether by moody’s or a moody’s competitor could also harm the reputation of the company or the credit rating industry damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on moody’s business operating results and financial condition as well as on the company’s ability to find suitable candidates for acquisition

the markets for credit ratings research credit risk management services research business intelligence and analytical services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer and investor demands and evolving regulatory requirements industry standards and market preferences the ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain innovative products technologies and services that anticipate customers’ and investors’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends in a timely and costeffective manner is a key factor in maintaining market share moody’s competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources brand recognition market experience and technological expertise and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may position price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by moody’s moody’s also competes indirectly against consulting firms and technology and information providers some of whom are also suppliers to moody’s these indirect competitors could in the future choose to compete directly with moody’s cease doing business with moody’s or change the terms under which it does business with moody’s in a way that could negatively impact our business in addition customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and services and its growth prospects further the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive internet information may reduce the demand for moody’s products and services moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors any inability of moody’s to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s is exposed to risks related to loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures 

moody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing industries as greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies in the future moody’s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis additionally relocation andor restaffing of employees due to brexit could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain talent for our european operations there is a risk that even when the company invests significant resources in attempting to attract train and retain qualified personnel it will not succeed in its efforts and its business could be harmed 

moody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of robert fauber the president and chief executive officer and other senior officers and key employees the loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions or investments may not produce anticipated results exposing the company to future significant impairment charges relating to its goodwill intangible assets or property and equipment 

moody’s regularly evaluates and enters into acquisition disposition or other strategic transactions and investments to strengthen its business and grow the company for example moody’s acquired bureau van dijk in 2017 reis in 2018 and regulatory datacorp rdc in february 2020 such transactions and investments present significant challenges and risks the company faces intense competition for acquisition targets especially in light of industry consolidation which may affect moody’s ability to complete such transactions on favorable terms or at all additionally the company makes significant investments in technology including software for internal use which can be expensive timeintensive and complex to develop and implement

any strategic transaction involves a number of risks including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations technologies and new employees the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the company prior to closing a transaction unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures scrutiny from competition and antitrust authorities failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business future developments that impair the value of purchased goodwill or intangible assets diversion of management’s focus from other business operations failure to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls procedures and policies disputes or litigation arising out of acquisitions or dispositions challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business coordination of product sales marketing and program and systems management functions integration of employees from the acquired business into moody’s organization integration of the acquired business’s accounting information technology human resources legal and other administrative systems with moody’s risks that acquired systems expose us to cybersecurity risks and for foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction or investment may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected as a result the failure of acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions and investments to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

at december 31 2020 moody’s had 4556 million of goodwill and 1824 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet approximately 93 of the goodwill and intangible assets reside in the ma business including those related to bureau van dijk and are allocated to the five reporting units within ma content ers mals bureau van dijk and reis the remaining 7 of goodwill and intangible assets reside in mis and primarily relate to icra failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in a significant asset impairment charge which would result in a noncash charge to operating expenses goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be especially difficult in periods of market or economic uncertainty and turmoil and requires significant management estimates and judgment in addition the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty an asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the global covid19 pandemic may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance and is having a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of many of our customers it is difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will adversely impact our business operations financial performance results of operations financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives 

our operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic that has caused and is expected to continue to cause the global slowdown of economic activity and significant volatility and disruption in financial markets because the severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences continue to be uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict the pandemic’s impact on our operations and financial performance as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives remains uncertain and difficult to predict further the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control including but not limited to governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic including restrictions on travel and workforce pressures the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies travel and economic activity the availability of federal state local or nonus funding programs general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility global economic conditions and levels of economic growth uncertainty presented by approved vaccines corresponding rollout and unanticipated consequences of such vaccine and the pace of recovery when the covid19 pandemic subsides 

the covid19 pandemic has subjected our operations and financial performance to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below 

– the global credit market disruptions and economic stimulus measures led to robust us investment grade and us speculative grade issuance that may not continue as government programs are scaled back wound down or terminated and as issuers reassess their capital position and liquidity needs 

– we continue to publish research and issue credit ratings in accordance with our public credit rating methodologies in a highly uncertain rapidly changing environment where it is difficult to predict the impact the covid19 pandemic has had on the operations and financial performance of many of our rated issuers given these unprecedented events and our prior experience during periods of volatility and economic uncertainty it is likely that our ratings and research will be challenged around the globe by the press rated entities investors and government agencies and officials such scrutiny has impacted and may continue to impact our reputation brand and credibility and result in future government and regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries and litigation 

– likewise ma continues to offer quantitative analytics in a highly uncertain rapidly changing environment where it is difficult to accurately capture the impact of the covid19 pandemic within its analytical models across different business sectors and geographies any failure of ma’s models to sufficiently account for covid19 impacts may impact ma”s reputation brand and credibility and could result in customer dissatisfaction andor contract cancellations

– illness travel restrictions or workforce disruptions could result in reduced sales opportunities for both mis and ma and result in an extension of the ma sales cycles on existing opportunities as well as higher attrition rates andor lower yields on renewable contracts 

– the covid19 pandemic may decrease demand for the financial intelligence and analytical tools ma provides in particular in the event that ma’s customers come under financial pressure and reduce spending for the types of products and services offered by ma 

– our customers are being impacted and will be impacted by the covid19 pandemic to differing degrees some of our customers may go out of business or lose access to marketbased sources of capital or experience significant spending constraints and layoffs reducing the number of issuers in the market issuance volume and demand for our products and services as a result we may face pricing pressure on our products delayed renewals for certain subscription based products and challenges to new sales which would in turn reduce revenue ultimately impacting our results of operations 

– the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility in the capital markets the company might not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like and our borrowing costs could increase 

– while we have transitioned to remote work for all employees globally maintaining such a state for an extended period of time may have a material adverse effect on our productivity our ability to meet the needs of our customers and may expose us to both operational and security risks in addition maintaining an infrastructure that supports a prolonged remote working environment may limit information technology resources available for other projects 

– as the covid19 pandemic continues to affect the global economy it may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks such as those surrounding cybersecurity described in our risk factors in this form 10k further the covid19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our operations or financial results

the company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security measures in order to protect its systems and data including employee training disaster plans and technical defenses the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threats despite the company’s best efforts it is not fully insulated from and has in the past experienced security threats and system disruptions although past incidents have not had a material adverse effect on the companys operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future because the methods used for these systems cyberattacks are rapidly changing the company despite significant focus and investment may be unable to anticipatedeploy sufficient protections against such incidents further the extent of a particular security incident and the steps needed to investigate may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident including the extent of the harm and how best to remediate it is known recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity compliance requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers cybersecurity incidents including the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data could cause reputational harm loss of customers and revenue fines regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard the company’s customers’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company in addition disclosure or media reports of actual or perceived security vulnerabilities to the company’s systems or those of the company’s third parties even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could lead to reputational harm loss of customers and revenue or increased regulatory actions oversight and scrutiny 

any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related protection of confidential information 

to conduct its operations the company regularly moves data across national borders and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to moody’s is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union privacy law and added a broad array of requirements for processing personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue additionally other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders further laws such as the california consumer privacy act enacted in january 2020 will among other things require covered companies to provide new disclosures to consumers and affords consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information the effects of noncompliance with the ccpa and other similar data privacy laws in other jurisdictions are significant however and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur additional costs and expenses all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements have required changes to certain business practices thereby increasing costs requiring significant management time and attention and subjecting the company to negative publicity as well as remedies that may harm its business including fines modified demands or orders the cessation of existing business practices and exposure to litigation regulatory actions sanctions or other statutory penalties 

the company is dependent on the use of thirdparty software data hosted solutions data centers cloud and network infrastructure together “third party technology” and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or service offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

moody’s relies on third party technology in connection with its product development and offerings and operations the company depends on the ability of third party technology providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis provide data necessary to develop and maintain its products and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the third party technology moody’s uses can become obsolete or restrictive incompatible with future versions of the company’s products fail to be comprehensive or accurate unavailable or fail to operate effectively including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and moody’s business could be adversely affected when the company is unable to timely or effectively replace such third party technology 

the company also monitors its use of third party technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements despite the company’s efforts the company cannot ensure that such third parties will permit moody’s use in the future resulting in increased third party technology acquisition costs and loss of rights in addition the company’s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for third party technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to third party technology are substantial in the ordinary course our thirdparties including our vendors are subject to various forms of cyber attacks to date such attacks have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business operations but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact some of these thirdparty suppliers are also moody’s competitors increasing the risks noted above when any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

covid19 

the company is closely monitoring the impact of the covid19 pandemic on all aspects of its business while the company has selectively reopened certain of its offices moody’s continues to require remote work for most employees globally and has operated effectively to date the company continues to monitor regional developments relating to the covid19 pandemic to inform decisions on the reopening of its offices 

the company experienced disruption in certain sectors of its business beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 resulting from market volatility associated with the covid19 crisis however at the date of the filing of this annual report on form 10k the company is unable to predict either the potential nearterm or longerterm impact that the covid19 crisis may have on its financial position and operating results due to numerous uncertainties regarding the duration and severity of the crisis including the length of time to distribute a vaccine as a result it is reasonably possible that the company could experience material impacts including but not limited to reductions in revenue and cash flows additional credit losses related to accounts receivables asset impairment charges and changes in the funded status of defined benefit pension plans while it is reasonably possible that the covid19 crisis could impact the results of operations and cash flows of the company in the near term moodys believes that it has adequate liquidity to maintain its operations with minimal disruption and to maintain compliance with its debt covenants

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies restructuring goodwill longlived assets including acquired intangible assets leases pension and other retirement benefits and income taxes actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

goodwill 

on july 31st of each year moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment ie mis and ma or one level below an operating segment ie a component of an operating segment 

the company has seven primary reporting units at december 31 2020 two within the company’s ratings business one for the icra business and one that encompasses all of moody’s other ratings operations and five reporting units within ma content ers mals bureau van dijk and reis the content reporting unit offers subscriptionbased research data and analytical products including credit ratings produced by mis credit research quantitative credit scores and other analytical tools economic research and forecasts business intelligence and company information products the ers reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions and also provides advanced actuarial software for the life insurance industry these products and services are primarily delivered via software that is licensed on a perpetual basis or sold on a subscription basis the mals reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training the bureau van dijk reporting unit primarily consists of the bureau van dijk business and the newly acquired rdc and am businesses and provides business intelligence and company information products the reis reporting unit which consists of the reis business and newly acquired catylist business provides commercial real estate market information and analytical tools 

the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a twostep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level in the first step the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount if a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist the company is not required to perform further testing if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the reporting unit will be quantitatively determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions realignments of reporting units or if there are indicators of potential impairment for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach the company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years 

interim goodwill impairment assessments performed in 2020 in advance of the companys annual assessment 

during the first half of 2020 the observable market capitalization of icra declined to a level that resulted in a significant decline in headroom the amount by which the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value from amounts reported in the companys form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 icra is a publicly traded company in india and accordingly the company is able to derive its fair value based on its observable average market capitalization plus a control premium over a relatively short duration of time while the estimate of the fair value of the icra reporting unit resulted in no impairment of goodwill in the first half of 2020 further declines in icras average market capitalization could result in impairment in future quarters as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form 10k the icra market capitalization reflects a level that does not result in impairment 

as discussed in further detail in note 10 to the companys consolidated financial statements icra has disclosed that it completed the internal examinations it conducted into anonymous allegations that were forwarded to icra by sebi certain additional allegations made during the course of that examination and a separate anonymous complaint icra reported that its board of directors have taken appropriate actions based on the findings of the completed examinations as of the date of this annual report on form 10k the company is unable to estimate the financial impact if any that may result from a potential unfavorable conclusion of these matters or any other icra inquiry an unfavorable resolution of such matters may negatively impact icra’s future operating results which could result in an impairment of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets in future quarters

at june 30 2020 the company performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment on the reis reporting unit acquired in october 2018 which resulted in no impairment of goodwill the company performed this quantitative assessment in response to a decline in projected cash flows relative to reis acquisition case projections and included the estimated impact of the covid19 crisis on the business while the fair value at june 30 2020 of the reis reporting unit exceeded its carrying value further declines in its financial projections could result in impairment in future quarters 

annual goodwill impairment assessment performed at july 31 2020 

at july 31 2020 the company performed qualitative assessment for each of the reporting units the qualitative analyses resulted in the company determining that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions which are more fully described below in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 

sensitivity analysis and key assumptions for deriving the fair value of a reporting unit 

the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december 31 2020 and the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit june 30 2020 for icra and reis july 31 2019 for all remaining reporting units 



methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units 

the following is a discussion regarding the company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units as of the date of each reporting unit’s last quantitative assessment june 30 2020 for reis and icra and july 31 2019 for the remaining reporting units as icra is a publicly traded company in india the company estimates its fair value using its observable market capitalization 

the fair value of each reporting unit excluding icra was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples the discounted cash flow analysis requires significant estimates including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit that could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition 

the sensitivity analysis on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions described below are as of each reporting unit’s last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology that require significant management judgment 

– future cash flow assumptions  the projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit these projections are consistent with the company’s operating budget and strategic plan beyond the forecasted period a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real gdp growth rates a sensitivity analysis of the revenue growth rates was performed on all reporting units for each reporting unit analyzed a 10 reduction in the revenue growth rates used would not have resulted in its carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value

– wacc  the wacc is the rate used to discount each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows the wacc is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity the cost of equity is based on a riskfree interest rate and an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit’s cash flows the cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the company’s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the wacc the cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested the wacc applied in each reporting units last quantitative test ranged from 85 to 90 differences in the wacc used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units a sensitivity analysis of the wacc was performed on all reporting units for each reporting unit analyzed an increase in the wacc of one percentage point would not result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value 

longlived assets 

longlived assets which consist primarily of amortizable intangible assets operating lease rou assets and property and equipment are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

under the first step of the recoverability assessment moodys compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group to its carrying value if the undiscounted future cash flows are greater than the carrying value no further assessment is required if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value moodys proceeds with step two of the assessment under step two of this assessment moodys is required to determine the fair value of the asset or asset group and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value in performing this assessment moodys must include assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value including the estimated future cash flows and discount rate moodys must apply judgment in developing estimated future cash flows and in the determination of market participant assumptions 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

for utps asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was signed into law which resulted in significant changes to us corporate tax laws the tax act includes a mandatory onetime deemed repatriation tax “transition tax” on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and reduces the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 from enactment of the tax act through december 31 2018 the company recorded a provision of 236 million related to the transition tax in addition the company has recorded a deferred tax asset of 50 million related to potential foreign tax credits which could be realized if certain utps resulted in tax assessments the transition tax liability reported on the company’s 2017 and 2018 tax returns is payable over eight years starting in 2018 and will not accrue interest 

pursuant to the tax act being signed into law all previously undistributed foreign earnings became subject to us tax in light of us tax reform the company has reassessed its capital allocation strategy including reevaluating its global cash position and revising its plans for repatriating or reinvesting foreign earnings the company regularly evaluates in which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings outside the us the company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us 

revenue recognition and costs to obtain a contract with a customer 

revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services 

46 moodys 2020 10k 

table of contents 

the discussion below outlines areas of the company’s revenue recognition process that require significant management judgment and estimates refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive discussion regarding the company’s accounting policies relating to the recognition of revenue and costs to obtain a contract with a customer 

determination of performance obligations 

when contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations the company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct 

in the company’s mis segment revenue arrangements with multiple elements are generally comprised of two distinct performance obligations the initial rating and the related monitoring services revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is generally recognized when the rating is delivered to the issuer whereas revenue from monitoring related to mis’s ratings is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed 

in the ma segment contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer when arrangements for software content or saas licenses also include related implementation services the company may be required to exercise significant judgment in determining the level of integration and interdependency between the promise to grant the software license and the promise to deliver the related implementation services this determination influences whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately with revenue generally being recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to the customer or not distinct and accounted for together with the implementation services with revenue being recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as implementation services are performed 

allocating consideration to performance obligations 

management judgment is also required in the determination of the ssp which is utilized to allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation at contract inception when the contract includes multiple distinct performance obligations 

in the mis segment the ssp for both ratings and monitoring services is generally based upon directly observable selling prices where the rating or monitoring service is sold separately 

in the ma segment for performance obligations where an observable price exists such as pcs the observable price is utilized if an observable price does not currently exist the company will utilize management’s best estimate of ssp for that good or service using estimation methods that maximize the use of observable data points 

the ssp in both segments is usually apportioned along the lines of class of customer nature of productservices and other attributes related to those products and services once ssp is determined for each performance obligation the transaction price including any discount is allocated based on the relative ssp of the separate performance obligations 

costs to obtain a contract with a customer 

costs incurred to obtain customer contracts such as sales commissions are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs are determined to be incremental to obtaining a contract would not have been incurred otherwise and the company expects to recover those costs these costs are amortized to expense on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of products or services to the customer for which the asset relates depending on the line of business to which the contract relates this amortization period may be based upon the average economic life of the products sold or average period for which services are provided inclusive of anticipated contract renewals 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities 

for claims litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and periodically adjusts these as appropriate when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range in instances when a loss is reasonably possible but uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if material 

as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly moody’s also discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to sec rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate

table of contents 

in view of the inherent difficulty of assessing the potential outcome of legal proceedings governmental regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries claims and litigation and similar matters and contingencies particularly when the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also may be unable to predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition and to accrue for and disclose such matters as and when required however because such matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur the ultimate outcome of such matters including the amount of any loss may differ from those estimates 

accounts receivable allowances 

on january 1 2020 the company adopted asu no 201613 “financial instruments—credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” as more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as the companys accounts receivable are shortterm in nature the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact to the companys allowance for bad debts or its policies and procedures for determining the allowance 

in order to determine an estimate of expected credit losses receivables are segmented based on similar risk characteristics including historical credit loss patterns and industry or class of customers to calculate reserve rates the company uses an aging method for developing its allowance for credit losses by which receivable balances are grouped based on aging category a reserve rate is calculated for each aging category which is generally based on historical information and is adjusted when necessary for current conditions eg macroeconomic or industry related and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future the company also considers customer specific information eg bankruptcy or financial difficulty when estimating its expected credit losses as well as the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances expected credit losses are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance actual uncollectible account writeoffs are recorded against the allowance 

in 2020 moodys assessment included consideration of the current covid19 pandemic and its estimated impact on the companys accounts receivable allowances this assessment involved the utilization of significant judgment regarding the severity and duration of the market disruption caused by the pandemic as well as judgment regarding which industries classes of customers and geographies would be most significantly impacted 

pension and other retirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these significant assumptions include the following 

– future compensation increases based on the company’s longterm actual experience and future outlook 

– longterm expected return on pension plan assets based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixedincome investments and 

– discount rates based on current yields on highgrade corporate longterm bonds 

the discount rates used to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31 2020 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the ftse pension discount curve the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with thirdparty actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s retirement plans additionally the company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released mortality improvement scale mp2020 to accompany the pri2012 mortality tables to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the society of actuaries 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise excluding differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual returns on plan assets the company amortizes as a component of annual pension expense total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets for moody’s retirement plans the total actuarial losses as of december 31 2020 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 152 million and moody’s expects to recognize a net periodic expense of 11 million in 2021 related to the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded us pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual returns could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under asc topic 715 the company amortizes the

impact of asset returns over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2020 the company has an unrecognized asset gain of 49 million of which 13 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of 2021 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2021 income before provision for income taxes these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2021 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s retirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 



1 weighted average discount rates of 224 and 230 for pension plans and other retirement plans respectively 

based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be approximately 31 million in 2021 an increase compared to the 27 million recognized in 2020 

leases 

the company’s operating leases do not provide an implicit interest rate accordingly the company must estimate the secured incremental borrowing rate attributable to the currency in which the lease is denominated in the derivation of operating lease liabilities and related operating lease rou assets this secured incremental borrowing rate is based on the information available at the lease commencement date and is utilized in the determination of the present value of lease payments 

in addition certain of moody’s leases have the option to extend the lease beyond the initial term or terminate the lease prior to the end of the term for these leases moody’s may be required to exercise significant judgment to determine when that option is reasonably certain of being exercised which will impact the lease term and determination of the lease liability and corresponding rou asset 

restructuring 

the company has engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs contract termination costs and asset impairments if the actual amounts differ from these estimates the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted for a full description of moody’s restructuring actions refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets valuation of investments in affiliates and the estimated lives of amortizable intangible assets management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s

market risk 

foreign exchange risk 

moody’s maintains a presence in more than 40 countries in 2020 approximately 42 of the company’s revenue and approximately 39 of the company expenses were denominated in functional currencies other than the us dollar principally in the british pound and the euro as such the company is exposed to market risk from changes in fx rates as of december 31 2020 approximately 61 of moody’s assets were located outside the us making the company susceptible to fluctuations in fx rates the effects of translating assets and liabilities of nonus operations with nonus functional currencies to the us dollar are charged or credited to oci 

the effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency are charged to other nonoperating income expense net in the company’s consolidated statements of operations accordingly the company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency the following table shows the impact to the fair value of the forward contracts if foreign currencies weakened against the us dollar or euro 



1 refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further detail on the forward contracts 

the change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by fx revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency 

derivatives and nonderivatives designated as net investment hedges 

the company designates derivative instruments and foreign currencydenominated debt as hedges of foreign currency risk of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries net investment hedges under asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging  

crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts 

as of december 31 2020 the company had the following derivative instruments designated as hedges of euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries 

• crosscurrency swaps to exchange an aggregate amount of €1079 million with corresponding euro fixed interest rates for an aggregate amount of 1220 million with corresponding usd fixed interest rates 

• crosscurrency swaps to exchange an aggregate amount of €959 million with corresponding interest based on the floating 3month euribor for an aggregate amount of 1080 million with corresponding interest based on the floating 3month us libor 

• foreign currency forward contracts to sell euro with the aggregate notional amount of €524 million and buy us dollar in the aggregate notional amount of 627 million

table of contents 

if the euro were to strengthen 10 relative to the us dollar there would be an approximate 313 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts recognized in oci which would be offset by favorable currency translation gains on the company’s euro net investment in foreign subsidiaries 

as of december 31 2020 the company also had a foreign currency forward contract to hedge the foreign currency risk related to a british pound dominated net investment in subsidiaries the foreign currency forward contract is to sell british pound with the notional amount of £134 million and buy euro in the aggregate notional amount of €148 million if the british pound were to strengthen 10 relative to the euro there would be an approximate 20 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the forward contract recognized in oci which would be offset by favorable currency translation gains on the company’s euro net investment in foreign subsidiaries 

eurodenominated debt 

as of december 31 2020 the company has designated €500 million of the 2015 senior notes and €750 million of the 2019 senior notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate fx exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries if the euro were to strengthen 10 relative to the us dollar there would be an approximate 153 million unfavorable adjustment to oci related to this net investment hedge this adjustment would be offset by favorable translation adjustments on the company’s euro net investment in subsidiaries 

interest rate and credit risk 

interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge 

the company’s interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixedrate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates the company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on certain of its longterm debt to a floating interest rate based on the 3month and 6month libor these swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing while net interest payments are recorded as interest expenseincome in the company’s consolidated statement of operations a hypothetical change of 100 bps in the liborbased swap rate would result in an approximate 52 million change to the fair value of the swap which would be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged item 

additional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and types of securities or other obligations outstanding moody’s believes the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixedincome market and related financial information market which includes information such as credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including 

– health of the world’s major economies 

– debt capital markets activity 

– disintermediation of credit markets 

– fiscal and monetary policy of governments and 

– business investment spending including mergers and acquisitions 

in an environment of increasing financial complexity and heightened attention to credit analysis and risk management moody’s is well positioned to benefit from continued growth in global fixedincome market activity and a more widespread use of credit ratings research and related analytical products moody’s expects that these developments will support continued longterm demand for high quality independent credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

strong secular trends should continue to provide longterm growth opportunities for mis key growth drivers include debt market issuance driven by global gdp growth continued disintermediation of fixedincome markets in both developed and emerging economies driving issuance and demand for new ratings products and services growth in ma is likely to be driven by deeper and broader penetration of the customer base as data demands regulatory compliance and other analytical requirements drive demand for ma’s products and expertise moreover pricing opportunities aligned with customer value creation and advances in information technology present growth opportunities for moody’s 

growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates business investment spending corporate refinancing needs merger and acquisition activity issuer profits consumer borrowing levels and securitization activity rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the dollarequivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets mis’s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decisions however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank deposit ratings insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings and other areas partially mitigate mis’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixedincome markets furthermore the strong growth seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid1990’s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil before stabilizing in 2011 despite significant declines from peak market issuance levels moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global fixedincome markets and provide opportunities for longterm revenue growth 

the pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and similarly investors’ ability to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell which in the absence of the appropriate technology might not be readily or easily obtainable this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of both established and newer capital markets as technology provides broader access to worldwide markets it also results in a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk data analytics and related services additionally information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support moody’s continued expansion in developing markets 

moodys 2019 10k 11 

an ongoing trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets moody’s believes that issuer use of global debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to traditional banking systems and that the trend of increased disintermediation will continue further disintermediation has continued because of the historically low interest rate environment and bank deleveraging which has encouraged a number of corporations and other entities to seek alternative funding in the bond markets 

moody’s also observes disintermediation in key emerging markets where economic growth may outpace internal banking system capacity thus disintermediation is expected to continue over the longerterm with moody’s targeting investment and resources to those markets where disintermediation and bond issuance is expected to remain robust 

in the aftermath of the global financial crisis banking insurance and capital markets authorities promulgated a wide range of new regulations to restore stability and confidence in financial institutions under their oversight programs such as basel iii solvency ii and ccar — among many others — prompted banks insurers securities dealers and asset managers to invest in more robust risk management practices and systems many of these investments drew on expertise and tools offered by ma resulting in strong revenue growth in the postcrisis period as banking and capital markets stabilized and with financial institutions better capitalized regulatorydriven demand for certain ma products has moderated while in other areas eg antimoney laundering aml and knowyourcustomer kyc compliance regulatorydriven demand for data and solutions remains strong we expect ma products and services that improve efficiencies provide business insights and enable compliance with financial regulation including aml kyc and accounting standards will continue to be adopted by institutions worldwide finally in order to respond to other sources of demand and drive growth ma is actively investing in new products including enhanced data sets and improved delivery methods eg softwareasaservice these efforts should support broader distribution of ma’s capabilities deepen relationships with existing customers and drive new customer acquisition

please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in the company’s securities risky and provide important information for the understanding of the “forwardlooking” statements discussed in item 7 of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on form 10k 

the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances the company may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on moody’s business financial condition operating results including components of the company’s financial results such as sales and profits cash flows and stock price these risk factors do not identify all risks that moody’s faces the company could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to the company or that the company currently does not consider to present significant risks in addition the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

a legal and regulatory risks 

moody’s faces risks related to us laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry and moody’s customers 

moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us including the reform act and the financial reform act these regulations are complex continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time see “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information these laws and regulations 

– seek to encourage and may result in increased competition among rating agencies and in the credit rating business 

– may result in alternatives to credit ratings or changes in the pricing of credit ratings 

– restrict the use of information in the development or maintenance of credit ratings 

– increase regulatory oversight of the credit markets and cra operations 

– provide for direct jurisdiction of the sec over cras that seek nrsro status and grant authority to the sec to inspect the operations of cras and 

– authorize the adoption of enhanced oversight standards and new pleading standards which may result in increases in the number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities and aggregate legal defense costs 

if these laws and regulations and any future rulemaking or court rulings reduce demand for credit ratings or increase costs moody’s may be unable to pass such costs through to customers in addition there may be uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations the company’s compliance and efforts to mitigate the risk of fines penalties or other sanctions can result in significant expenses legal proceedings that are increasingly lengthy can result in uncertainty over and exposure to liability 

it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on moody’s business and its customers’ businesses for example new laws and regulations may affect mis’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which mis’s ratings are developed assigned and communicated affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate impact the demand for mis’s ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business including by restricting or mandating business models for rating agencies further speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect moody’s stock price although these legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally they may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and can have a material adverse effect on moody’s operations profitability and competitiveness the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized 

moodys 2019 10k 17 

in addition ma derives a significant amount of its sales in the ers and professional services lobs from banks and other financial services providers who are subject to regulatory oversight us banking regulators including the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the consumer financial protection board as well as many state agencies have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with thirdparty relationships which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity by contract or otherwise and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider’s business arrangement with thirdparty service providers and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their thirdparty relationships in light of this ma’s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought to and may further revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with ma this can result in delayed or reduced sales to such customers adversely affect ma’s relationship with such customers increase the costs of doing business with such customers andor result in ma assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers 

moody’s faces risks related to financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry and moody’s customers 

in addition to the extensive and evolving us laws and regulations governing the industry foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings in particular the eu has adopted a common regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the eu as a result esma has direct supervisory authority for cras in the eu and has the power to take enforcement action against noncompliant cras including through the issuance of public notices withdrawal of registration and in some cases the imposition of fines although the commission published a report in 2016 concluding that no new european legislation was needed for the industry at that time the report also stated that it would continue to monitor the credit rating industry and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation for example in 2018 esma published final guidance on the applicability of eu regulation to endorsed ratings which became effective on january 1 2019 see “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information 

mis is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection in the eu applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations and restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed additional procedural and substantive requirements include conditions for the issuance of credit ratings rules regarding the organization of cras restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest including fees that are based on costs and are nondiscriminatory and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments compliance with the eu regulations may increase costs of operations and could have a significant negative effect on moody’s operations profitability or ability to compete or the markets for its products and services including in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict in addition exposure to increased liability under the eu regulations may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact moody’s results of operations 

in addition regulators in europe and other foreign markets in which ma is active have issued guidance similar to that issued in the us relating to financial institutions’ assessment and management of risks associated with thirdparty relationships such guidelines include the european banking authority’s guidelines on outsourcing which became effective on september 30 2019 in light of this ma’s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought and may further revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with ma this can result in delayed or reduced sales to such customers adversely affect ma’s relationship with such customers increase the costs of doing business with such customers andor result in ma assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers 

the eu and other jurisdictions engage in rulemaking on an ongoing basis that could significantly impact operations or the markets for moody’s products and services including regulations extending to products and services not currently regulated and regulations affecting the need for debt securities to be rated expansion of supervisory remit to include noneu ratings used for regulatory purposes increasing the level of competition in the market for credit ratings establishing criteria for credit ratings or limiting the entities authorized to provide credit ratings regulation of pricing such that fees that are based on costs and are nondiscriminatory on activities provided by ma such as the distribution of ratings and research and laws and regulations related to collection use accuracy correction and sharing of personal information by cras additionally as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form 10k there remains uncertainty regarding the impact that brexit will have on the credit rating industry within the uk the eu and other jurisdictions although moody’s will monitor these developments moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations and the effect that they will have on moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant financial reforms in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition

the company faces exposure to litigation and government regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to rating opinions and other business practices 

moody’s faces exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to mis’s ratings actions as well as other business practices and products if the market value of creditdependent instruments declines or defaults whether as a result of difficult economic times turbulent markets or otherwise the number of investigations and legal proceedings that moody’s faces could increase significantly parties who invest in securities rated by mis may pursue claims against mis or moody’s for losses they face in their portfolios moody’s has faced numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation government investigations and inquiries concerning events linked to the us subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during the financial crisis of 20072008 legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time to addressing other business issues and any of these proceedings investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments damages fines penalties or activity restrictions risks relating to legal proceedings are heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the us in addition new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time furthermore when moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by moody’s increase substantially as does the risk of an adverse outcome 

additionally as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses moody’s will continue to review the latest information available and may change its accounting estimates which could require moody’s to record or increase liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the company currently faces due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought there is a risk that moody’s will be subject to judgments settlements fines penalties or other adverse results that have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related to its compliance and risk management programs 

moody’s operates in a number of countries and as a result the company is required to comply and quickly adapt with numerous international and us federal state and local laws and regulations the company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations including anticorruption laws is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel moody’s policies and procedures to identify evaluate and manage the company’s risks including risks resulting from acquisitions may not be fully effective and moody’s employees or agents may engage in misconduct fraud or other errors it is not always possible to deter such errors and the precautions the company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases if moody’s employees violate its policies or if the company’s risk management methods are not effective the company could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of the company’s employees fines penalties regulatory sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or other penalties and may suffer harm to its reputation financial condition and operating results 

moody’s faces risks related to protecting its intellectual property rights 

moody’s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary failure to protect the company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the company’s ability to compete effectively businesses the company acquires also involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges the company faces in protecting its strategic advantage in addition the company’s operating results can be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets on january 6 2015 a rule with direct relevance to the cra industry was published in the official journal of the european union regarding the types of information that cras are to provide about certain ratings those that were paid for by issuers for publication on a central website administered by esma the european ratings platform this rule directly relates to the company’s intellectual property as it requires that the company provide proprietary information at no cost that the company currently sells which could result in lost revenue esma launched the european rating platform for public use on december 1 2016 

unauthorized third parties may also try to obtain and use technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary it is also possible that moody’s competitors or other entities could obtain patents related to the types of products and services that moody’s offers and attempt to require moody’s to stop developing or marketing the products or services to modify or redesign the products or services to avoid infringing or to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services even if moody’s attempts to assert or protect its intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful the company’s ability to establish maintain and protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights against theft misappropriation or infringement could be materially and adversely affected by insufficient andor changing proprietary rights and intellectual property legal protections in some jurisdictions and markets these risks and the cost time and resources needed to address them may increase as the company’s business grows and its profile rises in countries with intellectual property regimes that are less protective than the rules and regulations applied in the united states

moody’s faces risks related to tax matters including changes in tax rates or tax rules 

as a global company moody’s is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries and jurisdictions as a result our effective tax rate is determined based on the pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates moody’s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where moody’s faces higher tax rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which moody’s is not able to realize the related tax benefit or changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in the tax accounting and other laws treaties regulations policies and administrative practices or changes to their interpretation or enforcement including changes applicable to multinational corporations such as the base erosion profit shifting initiative being conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development which requires companies to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world and the european union’s state aid rulings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition and may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries 

for example the tax act made significant changes to the us federal tax laws many aspects of the new legislation are currently uncertain or unclear and may not be clarified for some time as additional regulatory guidance is issued interpreting or clarifying the tax act or if the tax accounting rules are modified there may be adjustments or changes to the company’s determination of its mandatory onetime deemed repatriation tax liability “transition tax” on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries recorded in 2017 additional regulatory guidance may also affect the company’s expected future effective tax rates and tax assets and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition furthermore the tax act may impact the volume of debt securities issued as discussed in the risk factor changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment levels and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

in addition moody’s is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and the company is experiencing increased scrutiny as its business grows moody’s regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits however developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect the company although the company believes its tax estimates and accruals are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its historical income tax provisions accruals and unrecognized tax benefits which could materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows and financial condition

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment levels and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets can negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the us and world financial markets furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional cras such as mis a majority of moody’s creditratingbased revenue is transactionbased and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past and may in the future negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings changes to us tax laws and policy can negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued in the us for example the tax act limits deductibility on interest payments and significantly reduces the tax cost associated with the repatriation of cash held outside the us both of which could negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued conditions that reduce issuers’ ability or willingness to issue debt securities such as market volatility declining growth currency devaluations or other adverse economic trends reduce the number and dollarequivalent volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees moody’s earns in its ratings business 

economic and government factors such as a longterm continuation of difficult economic conditions a reemergence of the sovereign debt crisis in europe the ultimate impact of brexit and current uncertainty in various other jurisdictions may have an adverse impact on the company’s business future debt issuances also could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates widening credit spreads regulatory and political developments growth in the use of alternative sources of credit and defaults by significant issuers declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient and cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term due in part to rent technology compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further costreduction initiatives including those undertaken to date could make it difficult for the company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings volatility in the financial markets including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition which the company may not be able to successfully offset with cost reductions

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies restructuring goodwill longlived assets including acquired intangible assets leases pension and other retirement benefits and income taxes actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

goodwill 

on july 31st of each year moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment ie mis and ma or one level below an operating segment ie a component of an operating segment 

the company has seven primary reporting units at december 31 2019 two within the company’s ratings business one for the icra business and one that encompasses all of moody’s other ratings operations and five reporting units within ma content ers mals bureau van dijk and reis the content reporting unit offers subscriptionbased research data and analytical products including credit ratings produced by mis credit research quantitative credit scores and other analytical tools economic research and forecasts business intelligence and company information products the ers reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions and also provides advanced actuarial software for the life insurance industry these products and services are primarily delivered via software that is licensed on a perpetual basis or sold on a subscription basis the mals reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training the bureau van dijk reporting unit primarily consists of the bureau van dijk business and primarily provides business intelligence and company information products the reis reporting unit which consists of the newly acquired reis business provides commercial real estate market information and analytical tools 

moodys 2019 10k 31 

the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a twostep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level in the first step the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount if a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist the company is not required to perform further testing if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the reporting unit will be quantitatively determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach the company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years 

at july 31 2019 the company performed quantitative assessments of the content ers mals bureau van dijk mis and icra reporting units and a qualitative assessment for the reis reporting unit which was acquired by moodys within one year of the companys annual assessment date the quantitative assessments did not result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value the qualitative analysis for reis resulted in the company determining that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reis reporting unit was less than its carrying amount 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions which are more fully described below in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 

sensitivity analysis and key assumptions for deriving the fair value of a reporting unit 

the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december 31 2019 and the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit july 31 2019 for all reporting units except reis 



1 reis was acquired in october 2018 due to the close proximity of the reis acquisition the purchase price approximates the fair value of the reporting unit in the event that reis actual performance does not meet its acquisitioncase cash flows an impairment in future quarters could result 

as illustrated in the preceding table the reporting unit most at risk for potential impairment is the mals reporting unit and failure to meet its financial projections could result in impairment in future quarters  

as discussed in further detail in note 11 to the companys consolidated financial statements icra has reported that it is addressing certain matters which are currently under investigation as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form 10k the company is unable to estimate the financial impact if any that may result from a potential unfavorable conclusion of these matters or any other icra inquiry an unfavorable resolution of such matters may negatively impact icra’s future operating results which could result in an impairment of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets in future quarters

methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units 

the following is a discussion regarding the company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units excluding icra as of july 31 2019 the date of each reporting unit’s last quantitative assessment as icra is a publicly traded company in india the company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization the fair value of each reporting unit excluding icra was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples the discounted cash flow analysis requires significant estimates including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit that could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition 

the sensitivity analysis on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions described below are as of each reporting unit’s last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology that requires significant management judgment 

– future cash flow assumptions —the projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit these projections are consistent with the company’s operating budget and strategic plan cash flows for the six years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis were utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets new customer acquisition and new products beyond six years a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real gdp growth rates a sensitivity analysis of the revenue growth rates was performed on all reporting units for each reporting unit analyzed a 10 reduction in the revenue growth rates used would not have resulted in its carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value 

– wacc —the wacc is the rate used to discount each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows the wacc is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity the cost of equity is based on a riskfree interest rate and an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit’s cash flows the cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the company’s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the wacc the cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested the wacc for all reporting units ranged from 85 to 90 as of july 31 2019 differences in the wacc used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units a sensitivity analysis of the wacc was performed on all reporting units as of july 31 2019 for all reporting units analyzed an increase in the wacc of one percentage point would not result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value 

longlived assets 

longlived assets which consist primarily of amortizable intangible assets operating lease rou assets and property and equipment are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

under the first step of the recoverability assessment moodys compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group to its carrying value if the undiscounted future cash flows are greater than the carrying value no further assessment is required if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value moodys proceeds with step two of the assessment under step two of this assessment moodys is required to determine the fair value of the asset or asset group and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value in performing this assessment moodys must include assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value including the estimated future cash flows and discount rate moodys must apply judgment in developing estimated future cash flows and in the determination of market participant assumptions 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

moodys 2019 10k 33 

for utps asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was signed into law which resulted in significant changes to us corporate tax laws the tax act includes a mandatory onetime deemed repatriation tax “transition tax” on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and reduces the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 due to the complexities involved in applying the provisions of the tax act in 2017 the company recorded a provisional estimate of 247 million related to the transition tax in 2017 in 2018 the irs issued notices clarifying certain aspects of the transition tax as a result the company reduced its provision for the transition tax by 11 million the irs may issue additional regulations or notices in future periods to clarify or amend provisions of the tax act and such guidance could result in revisions in future periods to the amounts recorded for the existing provisions and interpretations of the tax act in addition in 2018 the company recorded a deferred tax asset of 48 million related to potential foreign tax credits which could be realized if certain utps resulted in tax assessments due to additional utps recorded the company increased the deferred tax asset to 50 million in 2019 the transition tax liability reported on the company’s 2017 and 2018 tax returns is payable over eight years starting in 2018 and will not accrue interest due to the reduction in us corporate income tax rates beginning in 2018 a decrease of 56 million was recorded to net deferred tax assets in 2017 the above amounts may be impacted by a number of additional considerations including but not limited to the issuance of regulations and the company’s ongoing analysis of the new law 

pursuant to the tax act being signed into law all previously undistributed foreign earnings became subject to us tax in light of us tax reform the company has reassessed its capital allocation strategy including reevaluating its global cash position and revising its plans for repatriating or reinvesting foreign earnings the company regularly evaluates in which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings outside the us the company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us 

revenue recognition and costs to obtain a contract with a customer 

revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services 

the discussion below outlines areas of the company’s revenue recognition process that require significant management judgment and estimates refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive discussion regarding the company’s accounting policies relating to the recognition of revenue and costs to obtain a contract with a customer 

determination of performance obligations 

when contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations the company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct 

in the company’s mis segment revenue arrangements with multiple elements are generally comprised of two distinct performance obligations the initial rating and the related monitoring services revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is generally recognized when the rating is delivered to the issuer whereas revenue from monitoring related to mis’s ratings is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed 

in the ma segment contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer when arrangements for software content or saas licenses also include related implementation services the company may be required to exercise significant judgment in determining the level of integration and interdependency between the promise to grant the software license and the promise to deliver the related implementation services this determination influences whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately with revenue generally being recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to the customer or not distinct and accounted for together with the implementation services with revenue being recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as implementation services are performed 

allocating consideration to performance obligations 

management judgment is also required in the determination of the ssp which is utilized to allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation at contract inception when the contract includes multiple distinct performance obligations 

in the mis segment the ssp for both ratings and monitoring services is generally based upon directly observable selling prices where the rating or monitoring service is sold separately 

in the ma segment for performance obligations where an observable price exists such as pcs the observable price is utilized if an observable price does not currently exist the company will utilize management’s best estimate of ssp for that good or service using estimation methods that maximize the use of observable data points 

34 moodys 2019 10k 

the ssp in both segments is usually apportioned along the lines of class of customer nature of productservices and other attributes related to those products and services once ssp is determined for each performance obligation the transaction price including any discount is allocated based on the relative ssp of the separate performance obligations 

costs to obtain a contract with a customer 

costs incurred to obtain customer contracts such as sales commissions are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs are determined to be incremental to obtaining a contract would not have been incurred otherwise and the company expects to recover those costs these costs are amortized to expense on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of products or services to the customer for which the asset relates depending on the line of business to which the contract relates this amortization period may be based upon the average economic life of the products sold or average period for which services are provided inclusive of anticipated contract renewals 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities 

for claims litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and periodically adjusts these as appropriate when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range in instances when a loss is reasonably possible but uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if material 

as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly moody’s also discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to sec rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate 

in view of the inherent difficulty of assessing the potential outcome of legal proceedings governmental regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries claims and litigation and similar matters and contingencies particularly when the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also may be unable to predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition and to accrue for and disclose such matters as and when required however because such matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur the ultimate outcome of such matters including the amount of any loss may differ from those estimates 

accounts receivable allowances 

moody’s records variable consideration in respect of estimated future adjustments to customer billings as an adjustment to revenue using the expected value method based on analysis of similar contracts in the same line of business such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts due to uncertainty relating to customers inability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance actual billing adjustments are recorded against the allowance depending on the nature of the adjustment actual uncollectible account writeoffs are recorded against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the company’s consolidated results of operations 

pension and other retirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these significant assumptions include the following 

– future compensation increases based on the company’s longterm actual experience and future outlook 

moodys 2019 10k 35 

– longterm expected return on pension plan assets based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixedincome investments and 

– discount rates based on current yields on highgrade corporate longterm bonds 

the discount rates used to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31 2019 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the ftse pension discount curve the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with thirdparty actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s retirement plans additionally the company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released mortality improvement scale mp2019 to accompany the pri2012 mortality tables to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the society of actuaries 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise excluding differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual returns on plan assets the company amortizes as a component of annual pension expense total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets for moody’s retirement plans the total actuarial losses as of december 31 2019 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 122 million and moody’s expects to recognize a net periodic expense of 8 million in 2020 related to the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded us pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual returns could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under asc topic 715 the company amortizes the impact of asset returns over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2019 the company has an unrecognized asset loss of 26 million of which 3 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2020 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2020 income before provision for income taxes these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2020 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s retirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 



1 weighted average discount rates of 304 and 305 for pension plans and other retirement plans respectively 

a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2020 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be approximately 28 million in 2020 an increase compared to the 24 million recognized in 2019 

leases 

the company’s operating leases do not provide an implicit interest rate accordingly the company must estimate the secured incremental borrowing rate attributable to the currency in which the lease is denominated in the derivation of operating lease liabilities and related operating lease rou assets this secured incremental borrowing rate is based on the information available at the lease commencement date and is utilized in the determination of the present value of lease payments 

in addition certain of moody’s leases have the option to extend the lease beyond the initial term or terminate the lease prior to the end of the term for these leases moody’s may be required to exercise significant judgment to determine when that option is reasonably certain of being exercised which will impact the lease term and determination of the lease liability and corresponding rou asset

restructuring 

the company has engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs contract termination costs and asset impairments if the actual amounts differ from these estimates the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted for a full description of moody’s restructuring actions refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets valuation of investments in affiliates and the estimated lives of amortizable intangible assets management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s

market risk 

foreign exchange risk 

moody’s maintains a presence in more than 40 countries in 2019 approximately 43 of the company’s revenue and approximately 42 of the company expenses were denominated in functional currencies other than the us dollar principally in the british pound and the euro as such the company is exposed to market risk from changes in fx rates as of december 31 2019 approximately 68 of moody’s assets were located outside the us making the company susceptible to fluctuations in fx rates the effects of translating assets and liabilities of nonus operations with nonus functional currencies to the us dollar are charged or credited to oci 

the effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency are charged to other nonoperating income expense net in the company’s consolidated statements of operations accordingly the company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency 

moodys 2019 10k 51 

the following table shows the impact to the fair value of the forward contracts if foreign currencies weakened against the us dollar or euro 



1 refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further detail on the forward contracts 

the change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by fx revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency 

eurodenominated debt and crosscurrency swaps designated as net investment hedges

credit and interest rate risk 

interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge 

the company’s interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixedrate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates the company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on certain of its longterm debt to a floating interest rate based on the 3month libor these swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing while net interest payments are recorded as interest expenseincome in the company’s consolidated statement of operations a hypothetical change of 100 bps in the liborbased swap rate would result in an approximate 27 million change to the fair value of the swap which would be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged item 

additional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to its reported results moody’s has included in this mda certain adjusted results that the sec defines as “nongaap financial measures” management believes that such nongaap financial measures when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the company’s performance facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking these nongaap measures as defined by the company are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies furthermore these nongaap measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other gaap measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the company below are descriptions of the company’s nongaap financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the nongaap measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure 

adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin 

the company presents adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on the operating performance of moody’s adjusted operating income excludes the impact of i restructuring charges ii depreciation and amortization iii acquisitionrelated expenses iv a loss pursuant to the divestiture of maks and v a captive insurance company settlement restructuring charges are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets acquisitionrelated expenses consist of expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of bureau van dijk and are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude over the course of the multiyear integration effort acquisitionrelated expenses from other acquisitions were not material the loss pursuant to the divestiture of maks is excluded as the frequency and magnitude of divestiture activity may vary widely from period to period and across companies the captive insurance company settlement which is more fully discussed in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements relates to the resolution of a matter that is not expected to recur in the future at this magnitude management believes that the exclusion of the aforementioned items as detailed in the reconciliation below allows for an additional perspective on the company’s operating results from period to period and across companies the company defines adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by revenue

adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps attributable to moody’s common shareholders

the company excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different ages and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets furthermore the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies also management believes that excluding acquisitionrelated amortization expense provides additional perspective when comparing operating results from period to period and with both acquisitive and nonacquisitive peer companies additionally acquisitionrelated expenses consist of expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of bureau van dijk and are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude over the course of the multiyear integration effort acquisitionrelated expenses from other acquisitions were not material restructuring charges are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies the loss and tax charge pursuant to the divestiture of maks are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of divestiture activity may vary widely from period to period and across companies the captive insurance company settlement which is more fully discussed in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements relates to the resolution of a matter that is not expected to recur in the future at this magnitude 

furthermore the company excluded the impact of 2018 adjustments pursuant to us tax reform and certain adjustments relating to the company’s nonus utps which resulted in significant adjustments to the provision for income taxes in the prior year the company excludes these items to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted eps from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and types of securities or other obligations outstanding beginning in mid2007 there was a severe market disruption and associated financial crisis both in the devel

 

 

oped and emerging markets resulting in a global decline in debt issuance activity for some significant asset classes and weak economic performance in advanced economies since this financial crisis many markets and economies have recovered and moody’s believes the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixedincome market and related financial information market which includes information such as credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in an environment of increasing financial complexity and heightened attention to credit analysis and risk management moody’s is well positioned to benefit from continued growth in global fixedincome market activity and a more widespread use of credit ratings research and related analytical products moody’s expects that these developments will support continued longterm demand for high quality independent credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

strong secular trends should continue to provide longterm growth opportunities for mis key growth drivers include debt market issuance driven by global gdp growth continued disintermediation of fixedincome markets in both developed and emerging economies driving issuance and demand for new ratings products and services growth in ma is likely to be driven by deeper and broader penetration of the customer base as data demands regulatory compliance and other analytical requirements drive demand for ma’s products and expertise moreover pricing opportunities aligned with customer value creation and advances in information technology present growth opportunities for moody’s 

growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates business investment spending corporate refinancing needs merger and acquisition activity issuer profits consumer borrowing levels and securitization activity rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the dollarequivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets mis’s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decisions however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank deposit ratings insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings and other areas partially mitigate mis’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixedincome markets furthermore the strong growth seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid1990’s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010 before stabilizing in 2011 with moody’s experiencing revenue growth in this market beginning in 2012 despite significant declines from peak market issuance levels moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global fixedincome markets and provide opportunities for longterm revenue growth 

the pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and similarly investors’ ability to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell which in the absence of the appropriate technology might not be readily or easily obtainable this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of both established and newer capital markets as technology provides broader access to worldwide markets it also results in a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk data analytics and related services additionally information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support moody’s continued expansion in developing markets 

an ongoing trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets moody’s believes that issuer use of global debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to traditional banking systems and that the trend of increased disintermediation will continue further disintermediation has continued because of the historically low interest rate environment and bank deleveraging which has encouraged a number of corporations and other entities to seek alternative funding in the bond markets 

 

 

moody’s also observes disintermediation in key emerging markets where economic growth may outpace internal banking system capacity thus disintermediation is expected to continue over the longerterm with moody’s targeting investment and resources to those markets where disintermediation and bond issuance is expected to remain robust 

in the aftermath of the global financial crisis banking insurance and capital markets authorities promulgated a wide range of new regulations to restore stability and confidence in financial institutions under their oversight programs such as basel iii solvency ii and ccar — among many others — prompted banks insurers securities dealers and asset managers to invest in more robust risk management practices and systems many of these investments drew on expertise and tools offered by ma resulting in strong revenue growth in the postcrisis period as banking and capital markets continue to stabilize and with financial institutions better capitalized regulatorydriven demand for ma products has moderated nonetheless we expect that ma products and services that enable compliance with financial regulation and accounting standards will continue to be adopted by institutions worldwide prompted by periodic revisions to regulatory frameworks such as the basel capital adequacy protocols moreover having responded to regulatory imperatives financial institutions are increasingly seeking to leverage investments in regulatory compliance systems to gain business insights and frontoffice efficiencies ma is well positioned to realize revenue growth by assisting in these efforts to apply backoffice analytics in support of frontline business decisions finally in order to respond to other sources of demand and drive growth ma is actively investing in new products including enhanced data sets and improved delivery methods eg softwareasaservice these efforts should support broader distribution of ma’s capabilities deepen relationships with existing customers and facilitate more new customer acquisition 

legislative bodies and regulators in the us europe and other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of cras which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of mis removal of references to ratings in certain regulations or increased costs of doing business for mis at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities 

moody’s operations are subject to various risks as more fully described in part i item 1a “risk factors” inherent in conducting business on a global basis such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions 

competition 

mis competes with other cras and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research many users of mis’s ratings also have inhouse credit research capabilities mis’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is sp global ratings sp a division of sp global there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp while in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp mis’s competitors in the us include fitch ratings dominion bond rating service dbrs am best company kroll bond rating agency inc and morningstar inc in europe there are approximately 45 companies currently registered with esma which include both purely domestic european cras and international cras such as sp fitch and dbrs there are additional competitors in other regions and countries some of which are global entities and compete across regions and asset classes while others focus on particular asset classes and regions 

ma competes broadly in the financial information industry against diversified competitors such as refinitiv bloomberg sp global market intelligence fitch solutions db ibm wolters kluwer fidelity national information services sas fiserv msci and ihs markit among others ma’s main competitors within rda include sp global market intelligence creditsights refinitiv intex ihs markit blackrock solutions factset and other providers of fixed income analytics valuations economic data and research in ers ma faces competition from both large software providers such as ibm algorithmics fidelity national information services sas oracle misys oliver wyman verisk analytics and various other vendors and inhouse solutions within professional services ma competes with a host of financial training and education firms and providers of offshore research and analytical services such as evalueserve and crisil global research  analytics

regulation 

mis and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the us and in other countries including by state and local authorities thus existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company’s operations and the markets for securities that it rates additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered each of the existing adopted proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which moody’s operates 

the regulatory landscape has changed rapidly in recent years and continues to evolve in the eu the cra industry is registered and supervised through a paneuropean regulatory framework the european securities and markets authority esma has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered cra industry throughout the eu mis is a registered entity and is subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional 

 

 

or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed reporting requirements to esma regarding fees and additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services in 2016 the commission published a report concluding that no new european legislation was needed for the industry at that time but that it would continue to monitor the credit rating industry and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation in addition from time to time esma publishes interpretive guidance or thematic reports regarding various aspects of the regulation two such reports were published in the first half of 2018 the first report provided further guidance from esma regarding the endorsement mechanism that cras will need to employ for those ratings that are produced outside of the eu but are used inside the eu by euregulated entities the second report discussed esma’s observations on cra’s fee practices further in march 2018 esma published a consultation report seeking feedback on the extent to which eu regulation should be applied to cras operating outside of the eu to make their ratings eligible for regulatory use in the eu in july 2018 esma published its final guidance on the applicability of eu regulation to endorsed ratings with an effective date of january 1 2019 in the final guidance esma indicated that as long as the underlying principles of the eu rules were adhered to esma did not expect that the eu’s cra rules would need to be exported to noneu jurisdictions for endorsement purposes 

separately on june 23 2016 the uk voted through a referendum to exit the eu the uk officially launched the exit process by submitting its article 50 letter to the eu informing it of the uk’s intention to exit the submission of this letter started the clock on the negotiation of the terms of exit which originally was expected to take up to two years but may take longer 

the longerterm impacts of the decision to leave the eu on the overall regulatory framework for the uk will depend in part on the relationship that the uk negotiates with the eu in the future in the interim however the uk’s markets regulator the financial conduct authority has indicated that all eu financial regulations will stay in place and that firms must continue to abide by their existing obligations as a consequence at this point in time there is no change to the regulatory framework under which mis operates and esma remains mis’s regulator both in the eu and in the uk 

in the us cras are subject to extensive regulation primarily pursuant to the reform act and the financial reform act the sec is required by these legislative acts to publish two annual reports to congress on nrsros the financial reform act requires the sec to examine each nrsro once a year and issue an annual report summarizing the examination findings among other requirements the annual report required by the reform act details the sec’s views on the state of competition transparency and conflicts of interests among nrsros among other requirements the sec voted in august 2014 to adopt its final rules for nrsros as required by the financial reform act the company has made and continues to make substantial it and other investments and has implemented the relevant compliance obligations 

in light of the regulations that have gone into effect in both the eu and the us as well as many other countries periodically and as a matter of course pursuant to their enabling legislation these regulatory authorities have and will continue to publish reports that describe their oversight activities over the industry in addition other legislation andor interpretation of existing regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future finally in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which mis operates the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of the company cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

us laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry and moody’s customers may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us including the reform act and the financial reform act these regulations are complex continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time see “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information these laws and regulations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these laws and regulations and any future rulemaking or court rulings could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs which moody’s may be unable to pass through to customers in addition there may be uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations the company may be required to incur significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines penalties or other sanctions legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on moody’s business and its customers’ businesses for example new laws and regulations may affect mis’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which mis’s ratings are developed assigned and communicated affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate impact the demand for mis’s ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business including by restricting or mandating business models for rating agencies further speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect moody’s stock price although these legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally they may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on moody’s operations profitability and competitiveness the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized 

in addition ma derives a significant amount of its sales in the ers and professional services segments from banks and other financial services providers who are subject to regulatory oversight us banking regulators including the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the consumer financial protection board as well as many state agencies have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with thirdparty relationships which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity by contract or otherwise and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider’s business arrangement with thirdparty service providers and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their thirdparty relationships in light of this ma’s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance may continue to revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with ma which may delay or reduce sales to such customers adversely affect ma’s relationship with such customers increase the costs of doing business with such customers andor result in ma assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers 

financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry and moody’s customers may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

in addition to the extensive and evolving us laws and regulations governing the industry foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings in particular the eu has adopted a common regulatory framework 

 

 

for rating agencies operating in the eu as a result esma has direct supervisory authority for cras in the eu and has the power to take enforcement action against noncompliant cras including through the issuance of public notices withdrawal of registration and in some cases the imposition of fines although the commission published a report in 2016 concluding that no new european legislation was needed for the industry at that time the report also stated that it would continue to monitor the credit rating industry and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation for example in 2018 esma published final guidance on the applicability of eu regulation to endorsed ratings which became effective on january 1 2019 see “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information 

mis is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection in the eu applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations and restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed additional procedural and substantive requirements include conditions for the issuance of credit ratings rules regarding the organization of cras restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest including fees that are based on costs and are nondiscriminatory and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments compliance with the eu regulations may increase costs of operations and could have a significant negative effect on moody’s operations profitability or ability to compete or the markets for its products and services including in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict in addition exposure to increased liability under the eu regulations may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact moody’s results of operations 

in addition regulators in europe and other foreign markets in which ma is active have issued guidance similar to that issued in the us relating to financial institutions’ assessment and management of risks associated with thirdparty relationships such guidelines include the committee of european banking supervisors guidelines on outsourcing and the european banking authority recommendations on outsourcing to cloud providers each of which is expected to be superseded by the european banking authority’s guidelines on outsourcing currently under development and expected to be issued in early 2019 in light of this ma’s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance may continue to revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with ma which may delay or reduce sales to such customers adversely affect ma’s relationship with such customers increase the costs of doing business with such customers andor result in ma assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers 

the eu and other jurisdictions engage in rulemaking on an ongoing basis that could significantly impact operations or the markets for moody’s products and services including regulations extending to products and services not currently regulated and regulations affecting the need for debt securities to be rated expansion of supervisory remit to include noneu ratings used for regulatory purposes increasing the level of competition in the market for credit ratings establishing criteria for credit ratings or limiting the entities authorized to provide credit ratings and laws and regulations related to collection use accuracy correction and sharing of personal information by cras additionally as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form 10k there remains uncertainty regarding the impact that brexit will have on the credit rating industry within the uk the eu and other jurisdictions although moody’s will monitor these developments moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations and the effect that they will have on moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant financial reforms in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company faces exposure to litigation and government regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to rating opinions and other business practices 

moody’s faces exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to mis’s ratings actions as well as other business practices and products if the market value of creditdependent instruments declines or defaults whether as a result of difficult economic times turbulent markets or otherwise the number of investigations and legal proceedings that moody’s faces could increase significantly parties who invest in securities rated by mis may pursue claims against mis or moody’s for losses they face in their portfolios moody’s has faced numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation government investigations and inquiries concerning events linked to the us subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during the financial crisis of 20072008 legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues and any of these proceedings investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments damages fines penalties or activity restrictions risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the us in addition new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time furthermore to the extent that moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by moody’s increase substantially as does the risk of an adverse outcome 

 

 

additionally as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses moody’s will continue to review the latest information available and may change its accounting estimates which could require moody’s to record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the company currently faces due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought there is a risk that moody’s will be subject to judgments settlements fines penalties or other adverse results that could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to legal economic operational and regulatory risks of operating in multiple jurisdictions 

moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the company operates may have an impact on the company’s business for example economic uncertainty in the eurozone or elsewhere including in latin america could affect the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas in addition operations abroad expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 additionally moody’s is subject to complex us foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the uk bribery act of 2010 and other antibribery and anticorruption laws although the company has implemented internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices such measures may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that the company has violated antibribery or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on moody’s reputation its ability to attract and retain employees its business operating results and financial condition 

 

 

moody’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located including new york city the location of moody’s headquarters major cities worldwide in which moody’s has offices and locations in china used for certain moody’s back office work this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure whether or not controlled by the company including the company’s electronic delivery systems data center facilities or the internet used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business many of the company’s products and services are delivered electronically and the company’s customers depend on the company’s ability to receive store process transmit and otherwise rapidly handle very substantial quantities of data and transactions on computerbased networks some of moody’s operations require complex processes and although the company has instituted extensive controls to reduce the risk of error inherent in our operations such risk cannot be completely eliminated the company’s customers also depend on the continued capacity reliability and security of the company’s telecommunications data centers networks and other electronic delivery systems including its websites and connections to the internet the company’s employees also depend on these systems for internal use any significant failure compromise cyberbreach interruption or a significant slowdown of operations of the company’s infrastructure whether due to human error capacity constraints hardware failure or defect natural disasters fire power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political unrest war or otherwise may impair the company’s ability to deliver its products and services 

moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful the company relies on thirdparty providers to provide certain essential services while the company believes that such providers are reliable the company has limited control over the performance of such providers to the extent any of the company’s thirdparty providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fails to adequately expand its services to meet the company’s needs and the needs of the company’s customers the company could experience lower revenues and higher costs additionally although the company maintains processes to prevent detect and recover from a disruption the company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations such persons’ ability to service and interact with moody’s customers may suffer the company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the company’s failure or the failure of a third party to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions a disruption to moody’s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its reputation business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees in the company’s computer systems and networks and in those of its third party vendors the cyber risks the company faces range from cyberattacks common to most industries to more advanced threats that target the company because of its prominence in the global marketplace or due to its ratings of sovereign debt breaches of moody’s or moody’s vendors’ technology and systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data material interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s or such vendors’ web sites applications data processing or disruption of other business operations or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the company including information about moody’s business employees or customers as well as sensitive personally identifiable information pii the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft measures that moody’s takes to avoid detect mitigate or recover from material incidents can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or may become ineffective to conduct its operations the company regularly moves data across national borders and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to moody’s is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective on may 25 2018 greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union privacy law and added a broad array of requirements for processing personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue additionally other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders further california recently enacted legislation the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” that will among other things require covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information when it goes into effect on january 1 2020 legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the ccpa before it goes into effect and it remains unclear what if any modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted the effects of the ccpa potentially are significant however and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses all of these evolving 

 

 

compliance and operational requirements have required changes to certain business practices thereby increasing costs may result in negative publicity or increased operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject the company to remedies that may harm its business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices and expose it to litigation regulatory actions sanctions or other statutory penalties 

the company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security measures in order to protect its systems and data including employee training disaster plans and technical defenses the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threats despite the company’s best efforts it is not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers any material breaches of cybersecurity including the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the company’s systems or those of the company’s third parties even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could cause the company to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue fines regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard the company’s customers’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company is dependent on the use of thirdparty software data hosted solutions data centers cloud and network infrastructure together “third party technology” and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or service offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

moody’s relies on third party technology in connection with its product development and offerings and operations the company depends on the ability of third party technology providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the third party technology moody’s uses may become obsolete incompatible with future versions of the company’s products unavailable or fail to operate effectively and moody’s business could be adversely affected if the company is unable to timely or effectively replace such third party technology the company also monitors its use of third party technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements despite the company’s efforts the company cannot ensure that such third parties will permit moody’s use in the future resulting in increased third party technology acquisition costs and loss of rights in addition the company’s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for third party technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to third party technology are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also moody’s competitors increasing the risks noted above if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment levels and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the us and world financial markets furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional cras such as mis a majority of moody’s creditratingbased revenue is transactionbased and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past and may in the future negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings the tax act in addition to other changes to us tax laws and policy could negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued in the us for example the tax act limits deductibility on interest payments and significantly reduce the tax cost associated with the repatriation of cash held outside the us both of which could negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued conditions that reduce issuers’ ability or willingness to issue debt securities such as market volatility declining growth currency devaluations or other adverse economic trends reduce the number and dollarequivalent volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees moody’s earns in its ratings business 

economic and government factors such as a longterm continuation of difficult economic conditions a reemergence of the sovereign debt crisis in europe the ultimate brexit outcome and current uncertainty in various other jurisdictions may have an adverse impact on the company’s business future debt issuances also could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates widening credit spreads regulatory and political developments growth in the use of alternative sources of credit and defaults by significant issuers declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

 

 

moody’s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient and cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term due in part to rent technology compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further costreduction initiatives including those undertaken to date could make it difficult for the company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings volatility in the financial markets including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition which the company may not be able to successfully offset with cost reductions 

the company faces increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

there is price competition in the credit rating research credit risk management markets research and analytical services and financial training and certification services moody’s faces competition globally from other cras and from investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions in research as well as from inhouse research operations competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services as well as increased competition from nonnrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors at the same time a challenging business environment and consolidation among customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and reduce the company’s customer base weak economic growth intensifies competitive pricing pressures and can result in customers’ use of free or lowercost information that is available from alternative sources or their development of alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk that replace the products currently purchased from moody’s while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services it may lose market share if its pricing is not sufficiently competitive in addition the reform act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies the formation of additional nrsros may increase pricing and competitive pressures furthermore in some of the countries in which moody’s operates governments may provide financial or other support to local rating agencies any inability of moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to reputation and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be significantly impacted factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities the timing and nature of changes in ratings a major compliance failure negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings regulators and legislative bodies including as to the ratings process and its implementation with respect to one or more securities and intentional or unintentional misrepresentations of moody’s products and services in advertising materials public relations information social media or other external communications operational errors whether by moody’s or a moody’s competitor could also harm the reputation of the company or the credit rating industry damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on moody’s business operating results and financial condition as well as on the company’s ability to find suitable candidates for acquisition 

the introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

the markets for credit ratings research credit risk management services research and analytical services and financial training and certification services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer demands and evolving regulatory requirements industry standards and market preferences the ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends in a timely and costeffective manner is a key factor in maintaining market share moody’s competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources brand recognition market experience and technological expertise and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may position price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by moody’s moody’s also competes indirectly against consulting firms and technology and information providers these indirect competitors could in the future choose to compete directly with moody’s cease doing business with moody’s or change the terms under which it does business with moody’s in a way that could negatively impact our business in addition customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and services and its growth prospects further the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive internet information may reduce the demand for moody’s products and services moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors any inability of moody to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

 

 

possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures may negatively impact the company 

moody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing industries as greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies in the future moody’s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that could adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis additionally relocation andor restaffing of employees due to brexit could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain talent for our european operations there is a risk that even if the company invests significant resources in attempting to attract train and retain qualified personnel it will not succeed in its efforts and its business could be harmed 

moody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of raymond w mcdaniel jr the president and chief executive officer and other senior officers and key employees the loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions or internal technology investments may not produce anticipated results exposing the company to future significant impairment charges relating to its goodwill intangible assets or property and equipment 

moody’s has entered into and expects to continue to enter into acquisition disposition or other strategic transactions and expects to make various investments to strengthen its business and grow the company such transactions as well as internal technology investments present significant challenges and risks the market for acquisition targets dispositions and other strategic transactions is highly competitive especially in light of industry consolidation which may affect moody’s ability to complete such transactions and complete such transactions on favorable terms if moody’s is unsuccessful in completing such transactions on favorable terms or if opportunities for expansion do not arise its business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected additionally the company makes significant investments in technology including software developed for internaluse which is timeintensive and complex to implement such investments may not be successful or may not result in the anticipated benefits resulting in asset writeoffs 

in august 2017 moody’s acquired bureau van dijk for 35420 million the anticipated growth synergies and other strategic objectives of the bureau van dijk acquisition as well as other completed transactions may not be fully realized and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations technologies and new employees the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the company prior to closing a transaction unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures scrutiny from competition and antitrust authorities failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business future developments that impair the value of purchased goodwill or intangible assets diversion of management’s focus from other business operations failure to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls procedures and policies challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business coordination of product sales marketing and program and systems management functions integration of employees from the acquired business into moody’s organization integration of the acquired business’s accounting information technology human resources legal and other administrative systems with moody’s and for foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected as a result the failure of acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

at december 31 2018 moody’s had 37813 million of goodwill and 15661 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet both of which increased significantly due to the acquisition of bureau van dijk in 2017 approximately 94 of the goodwill and intangible assets reside in the ma business including those related to bureau van dijk and are allocated to the six reporting units within ma content ers mals maks bureau van dijk and reis the remaining 6 of goodwill and intangible assets reside in mis and primarily relate to icra failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in a significant asset impairment charge which would result in a noncash charge to operating expenses goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be especially difficult in periods of market or economic uncertainty and turmoil and requires significant management estimates and judgment in addition the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty an asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

 

 

the company’s compliance and risk management programs may not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

moody’s operates in a number of countries and as a result the company is required to comply and quickly adapt with numerous international and us federal state and local laws and regulations the company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations including anticorruption laws is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel moody’s policies and procedures to identify evaluate and manage the company’s risks including risks resulting from acquisitions may not be fully effective and moody’s employees or agents may engage in misconduct fraud or other errors it is not always possible to deter such errors and the precautions the company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases if moody’s employees violate its policies or if the company’s risk management methods are not effective the company could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of the company’s employees fines penalties regulatory sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or other penalties and may suffer harm to its reputation financial condition and operating results 

legal protections for the company’s intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or available to protect the company’s competitive advantages 

moody’s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary failure to protect the company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the company’s ability to compete effectively businesses the company acquires also involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges the company faces in protecting its strategic advantage in addition the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets on january 6 2015 a rule with direct relevance to the cra industry was published in the official journal of the european union regarding the types of information that cras are to provide about certain ratings those that were paid for by issuers for publication on a central website administered by esma the european ratings platform this rule directly relates to the company’s intellectual property as it requires that the company provide proprietary information at no cost that the company currently sells which could result in lost revenue esma launched the european rating platform for public use on december 1 2016 

unauthorized third parties may also try to obtain and use technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary it is also possible that moody’s competitors or other entities could obtain patents related to the types of products and services that moody’s offers and attempt to require moody’s to stop developing or marketing the products or services to modify or redesign the products or services to avoid infringing or to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services even if moody’s attempts to assert or protect its intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful the company’s ability to establish maintain and protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights against theft misappropriation or infringement could be materially and adversely affected by insufficient andor changing proprietary rights and intellectual property legal protections in some jurisdictions and markets these risks and the cost time and resources needed to address them may increase as the company’s business grows and its profile rises in countries with intellectual property regimes that are less protective than the rules and regulations applied in the united states 

changes in tax rates or tax rules could affect future results 

as a global company moody’s is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries and jurisdictions as a result our effective tax rate is determined based on the pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates moody’s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where moody’s faces higher tax rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which moody’s is not able to realize the related tax benefit or changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in the tax accounting and other laws treaties regulations policies and administrative practices or changes to their interpretation or enforcement including changes applicable to multinational corporations such as the base erosion profit shifting initiative being conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development which requires companies to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world and the european union’s state aid rulings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition and may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries 

for example the tax act made significant changes to the us federal tax laws many aspects of the new legislation are currently uncertain or unclear and may not be clarified for some time as additional regulatory guidance is issued interpreting or clarifying the tax act or if the tax accounting rules are modified there may be adjustments or changes to the company’s determination of its mandatory onetime deemed repatriation tax liability “transition tax” on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries recorded in 2017 additional regulatory guidance may also affect the company’s expected future effective tax rates and tax assets and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition furthermore the tax act may impact the volume of debt securities issued as discussed in the risk factor changes in the volume of 

 

 

debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment levels and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

in addition moody’s is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and the company is experiencing increased scrutiny as its business grows moody’s regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits however developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect the company although the company believes its tax estimates and accruals are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its historical income tax provisions accruals and unrecognized tax benefits which could materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows and financial condition

this mda contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” commencing on page 57 and item 1a “risk factors” commencing on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties risks and other factors associated with these statements 

the company 

moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings ii credit capital markets and economic research data and analytical tools iii software solutions that support financial risk management activities iv quantitatively derived credit scores v learning solutions and certification services vi offshore financial research and analytical services and vii company information and business intelligence products moody’s reports in two reportable segments mis and ma 

mis the credit rating agency publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors additionally mis earns revenue from certain nonratingsrelated operations which consist primarily of financial instrument pricing services in the asiapacific region as well as revenue from icra’s nonratings operations the revenue from these operations is included in the mis other lob and is not material to the results of the mis segment 

the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets within its rda business ma offers subscription based research data and analytical products including credit ratings produced by mis credit research quantitative credit scores and other analytical tools economic research and forecasts business intelligence and company information products and commercial real estate data and analytical tools within its ers business ma provides software solutions as well as related risk management services the ps business provides offshore analytical and research services along with learning solutions and certification programs 

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies restructuring goodwill and acquired intangible assets pension and other retirement benefits and income taxes actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

on july 31st of each year moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment ie mis and ma or one level below an operating segment ie a component of an operating segment 

the company has eight primary reporting units two within the company’s ratings business one for the icra business and one that encompasses all of moody’s other ratings operations and six reporting units within ma content ers mals formerly fstc maks bureau van dijk and reis the content reporting unit offers subscription based research data and analytical products including credit ratings produced by mis credit research quantitative credit scores and other analytical tools economic research and forecasts business intelligence and company information products and credit analytical tools the ers reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions and also provides advanced actuarial software for the life insurance industry these products and services are primarily delivered via software that is licensed on a perpetual basis or sold on a subscription basis the mals reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training the maks reporting unit provides offshore research and analytical services the bureau van dijk reporting unit consists of the bureau van dijk business which was acquired on august 10 2017 and primarily provides business intelligence and company information products the reis reporting unit consists of the newly acquired reis business and provides commercial real estate market information and analytical tools 

 

 

the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a twostep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level in the first step the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount if a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist the company is not required to perform further testing if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the reporting unit will be quantitatively determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value in accordance with asu no 201704 “intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach the company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years 

at july 31 2018 the company performed quantitative assessments of the ers mals maks and icra reporting units and a qualitative assessment for the remaining reporting units no quantitative assessment resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value each qualitative analysis resulted in the company determining that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount 

the company quantitatively tested the ers mals maks and icra reporting units as of july 31 2018 due to the factors outlined below 

 

  

  

 determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset including its estimated useful life involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital the effects of external factors and market conditions as well as appropriate comparable market metrics however as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from these estimates and the time frame of such changes may be rapid in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 

 

 

sensitivity analyses and key assumptions for deriving the fair value of a reporting unit 

the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december 31 2018 and the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit july 31 2018 for ers mals maks and icra july 31 2016 for mis and content 

 

  

  

  

 methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units 

the following is a discussion regarding the company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units excluding icra as of the date of each reporting unit’s last quantitative assessment july 31 2018 for ers mals and maks and july 31 2016 for mis and content as icra is a publicly traded company in india the company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization 

the fair value of each reporting unit excluding icra was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples the discounted cash flow analysis requires significant estimates including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit that could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition 

the sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions described below are as of each reporting unit’s last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology that requires significant management judgment 

 

  

  

 

 income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

for utps asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was signed into law which resulted in significant changes to us corporate tax laws the tax act includes a mandatory onetime deemed repatriation tax “transition tax” on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and reduces the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 due to the complexities involved in applying the provisions of the tax act in 2017 the company recorded a provisional estimate of 2473 million related to the transition tax in 2017 in 2018 the irs issued notices clarifying certain aspects of the transition tax as a result the company reduced its provision for the transition tax by 109 million the irs may issue additional regulations or notices in future periods to clarify or amend provisions of the tax act and such guidance could result in revisions in future periods to the amounts recorded for the existing provisions and interpretations of the tax act in addition in 2018 the company recorded a deferred tax asset of 481 million related to potential foreign tax credits which could be realized if certain utps resulted in tax assessments the transition tax liability reported on the company’s 2017 tax return is payable over eight years starting in 2018 and will not accrue interest due to the reduction in us corporate income tax rates beginning in 2018 a decrease of 562 million was recorded to net deferred tax assets in 2017 the above amounts may be impacted by a number of additional considerations including but not limited to the issuance of regulations and the company’s ongoing analysis of the new law 

pursuant to the tax act being signed into law all previously undistributed foreign earnings became subject to us tax in light of us tax reform the company has reassessed its capital allocation strategy including reevaluating its global cash position and revising its plans for repatriating or reinvesting foreign earnings the company regularly evaluates in which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings outside the us the company has provided nonus deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us 

revenue recognition and costs to obtain a contract with a customer 

revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services 

the discussion below outlines areas of the company’s revenue recognition process that require significant management judgment and estimates refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive discussion regarding the company’s accounting policies relating to the recognition of revenue and costs to obtain a contract with a customer 

 

 

determination of performance obligations 

when contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations the company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct 

in the company’s mis segment revenue arrangements with multiple elements are generally comprised of two distinct performance obligations initial rating fees and the related monitoring services revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is generally recognized when the rating is delivered to the issuer whereas revenue from monitoring related to mis’s ratings is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed 

in the ma segment contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer when arrangements for software content or saas licenses also include related implementation services the company may be required to exercise significant judgment in determining the level of integration and interdependency between the promise to grant the software license and the promise to deliver the related implementation services this determination influences whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately with revenue generally being recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to the customer or not distinct and accounted for together with the implementation services with revenue being recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as implementation services are performed 

allocating consideration to performance obligations 

management judgment is also required in the determination of the ssp which is utilized to allocate the consideration from a contract with a customer to each distinct performance obligation 

in the mis segment the company allocates the transaction price within arrangements that include multiple elements based upon the relative ssp of each service at contract inception the ssp for monitoring fees in these arrangements is generally based upon directly observable selling prices where the monitoring service is sold separately the company generally utilizes management’s best estimate of ssp for initial rating fees and considers all available data points mis generally provides initial ratings only in transactions with customers that include monitoring services related to the rating 

in the ma segment revenue is generally allocated to all performance obligations based upon the relative ssp at contract inception for performance obligations where an observable price exists such as pcs the observable price is utilized if an observable price does not currently exist the company will utilize management’s best estimate of ssp for that good or service using estimation methods that maximize the use of observable data points 

the ssp in both segments is usually apportioned along the lines of class of customer nature of productservices and other attributes related to those products and services once ssp is determined for each performance obligation the transaction price including any discount is allocated based on the relative ssp of the separate performance obligations 

costs to obtain a contract with a customer 

costs incurred to obtain customer contracts such as sales commissions are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs are determined to be incremental to obtaining a contract would not have been incurred otherwise and the company expects to recover those costs these costs are amortized to expense consistent with the recognition pattern of the related revenue over time depending on the line of business to which the contract relates this amortization period may be based upon the average economic life of the products sold or average period for which services are provided inclusive of anticipated contract renewals determining the estimated economic life of the products sold requires judgment with respect to anticipated future technological changesproduct enhancements 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities 

for claims litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range in other instances where a loss is reasonably possible management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss but discloses the contingency if material 

 

 

as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation regulatory governmental investigations and inquiries enforcement and similar matters and contingencies particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also cannot predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition however in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time 

the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary insures the company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation employment practices litigation employee medical claims and terrorism for which the claims are not material to the company in addition for claim years 2008 and 2009 the insurance subsidiary insured the company for defense costs related to professional liability claims for matters insured by the company’s insurance subsidiary moody’s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion the company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management’s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates defense costs for matters not selfinsured by the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided 

accounts receivable allowances and contract assets 

moody’s records variable consideration in respect of estimated future adjustments to customer billings as an adjustment to revenue using the expected value method based on analysis of similar contracts in the same line of business such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance or to contract assets additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance actual billing adjustments are recorded against the allowance or contract asset depending on the nature of the adjustment actual uncollectible account writeoffs are recorded against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the company’s consolidated results of operations 

pension and other retirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these significant assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

 the discount rates used to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31 2018 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the ftse pension discount curve the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with thirdparty actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s retirement plans additionally the company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released mortality improvement scale mp2018 to accompany the rp2014 mortality tables to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the society of actuaries 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise excluding differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual returns on plan assets the company amortizes as a component of annual 

 

 

pension expense total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets for moody’s retirement plans the total actuarial losses as of december 31 2018 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 835 million and moody’s expects to recognize a net periodic expense of 36 million in 2019 related to the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded us pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual returns could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under asc topic 715 the company amortizes the impact of asset returns over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2018 the company has an unrecognized asset loss of 125 million of which 43 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2020 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2019 income before provision for income taxes these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2019 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s retirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  

 a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2019 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be approximately 24 million in 2019 a decrease compared to the 307 million recognized in 2018 

restructuring 

the company has engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs contract termination costs and asset impairments if the actual amounts differ from these estimates the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted for a full description of moody’s restructuring actions refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets valuation of investments in affiliates and the estimated lives of amortizable intangible assets management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s 

reportable segments 

the company is organized into two reportable segments at december 31 2018 mis and ma

market risk 

foreign exchange risk 

moody’s maintains a presence in 42 countries in 2018 approximately 43 of both the company’s revenue and expenses were denominated in functional currencies other than the us dollar principally in the british pound and the euro as such the company is exposed to market risk from changes in fx rates as of december 31 2018 approximately 71 of moody’s assets were located outside the us making the company susceptible to fluctuations in fx rates the effects of translating assets and liabilities of nonus operations with nonus functional currencies to the us dollar are charged or credited to oci 

the effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency are charged to other nonoperating income expense net in the company’s consolidated statements of operations accordingly the company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency the following table shows the impact to the fair value of the forward contracts if foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar 

 

  

  

 

the change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by fx revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency 

eurodenominated debt and crosscurrency swaps designated as net investment hedges 

the company has designated € 500 million of the 2015 senior notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate fx exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries if the euro were to strengthen 10 relative to the us dollar there would be an approximate 57 million unfavorable adjustment to oci related to this net investment hedge this adjustment would be offset by favorable translation adjustments on the company’s euro net investment in subsidiaries 

during 2018 the company entered into crosscurrency swaps to exchange an aggregate amount of € 7102 million with corresponding interest based on the floating 3month euribor for an aggregate amount of 8300 million with corresponding interest based on the floating 3month us libor which were designated as net investment hedges under asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging  the purpose of these crosscurrency swaps is to mitigate fx exposure related to a portion of the company’s euro net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in eurousd exchange rates if the euro were to strengthen 10 relative to the us dollar there would be an approximate 81 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the crosscurrency swaps recognized in oci which would be offset by favorable currency translation gains on the company’s euro net investment in foreign subsidiaries 

credit and interest rate risk 

interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge 

the company’s interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixedrate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates the company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on certain of its longterm debt to a floating interest rate based on the 3month libor these swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing while net interest payments are recorded as interest expenseincome in the company’s consolidated statement of operations a hypothetical change of 100 bps in the liborbased swap rate would result in an approximate 36 million change to the fair value of the swap which would be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged item 

additional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k

 nongaap financial measures 

in addition to its reported results moody’s has included in this mda certain adjusted results that the sec defines as “nongaap financial measures” management believes that such nongaap financial measures when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the company’s performance facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking these nongaap measures as defined by the company are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies furthermore these nongaap measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other gaap measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the company below are descriptions of the company’s nongaap financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the nongaap measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure 

adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin 

the company presents adjusted operating income because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating performance of moody’s adjusted operating income excludes depreciation and amortization restructuring and acquisition

 

 

related expenses depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets restructuring charges are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies acquisitionrelated expenses consist of expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of bureau van dijk and are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses on an annual basis which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the multiyear integration effort acquisitionrelated expenses from other acquisitions were not material management believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization restructuring charges and acquisitionrelated expenses as detailed in the reconciliation below allows for an additional perspective on the company’s operating results from period to period and across companies the company defines adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by revenue 

 

 adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps attributable to moody’s common shareholders 

the company presents adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on the operating performance of moody’s adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets acquisitionrelated expenses restructuring charges the purchase price hedge gain the ccxi gain the effects of us tax reform and certain adjustments relating to the company’s nonus utps 

the company excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different ages and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets furthermore the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies also management believes that excluding acquisitionrelated amortization expense provides additional perspective when comparing operating results from period to period and with both acquisitive and nonacquisitive peer companies additionally acquisitionrelated expenses are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses on an annual basis which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the multiyear integration effort relating to bureau van dijk acquisitionrelated expenses from other acquisitions were not material 

the company excludes the purchase price hedge gain the ccxi gain and restructuring charges to provide additional perspective on the company’s operating results from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods 

furthermore us tax reform as well as changes in tax laws in europe were both enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting in significant adjustments to the provision for income taxes the company excludes these adjustments as well as the impact of 2018 adjustments pursuant to us tax reform and certain adjustments relating to the company’s nonus utps which resulted in significant adjustments to the provision for income taxes in 2018 the company excludes these items to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted eps from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and types of securities or other obligations outstanding beginning in mid2007 there was a severe market disruption and associated financial crisis both in the devel

 

 oped and emerging markets resulting in a global decline in debt issuance activity for some significant asset classes and weak economic performance in advanced economies since this financial crisis many markets and economies have recovered and moody’s believes the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixedincome market and related financial information market which includes information such as credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in an environment of increasing financial complexity and heightened attention to credit analysis and risk management moody’s is well positioned to benefit from continued growth in global fixedincome market activity and a more widespread use of credit ratings research and related analytical products moody’s expects that these developments will support continued longterm demand for high quality independent credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

strong secular trends should continue to provide longterm growth opportunities for mis key growth drivers include debt market issuance driven by global gdp growth continued disintermediation of fixedincome markets in both developed and emerging economies driving issuance and demand for new ratings products and services growth in ma is likely to be driven by deeper and broader penetration of its customer base as regulatory compliance and other analytical requirements drive demand for ma’s products and expertise moreover pricing opportunities aligned with customer value creation and advances in information technology present growth opportunities for moody’s 

growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates business investment spending corporate refinancing needs merger and acquisition activity issuer profits consumer borrowing levels and securitization activity rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the dollarequivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets mis’s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decisions however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank deposit ratings insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings and other areas partially mitigate mis’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixedincome markets furthermore the strong growth seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid1990’s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010 before stabilizing in 2011 with moody’s experiencing revenue growth in this market beginning in 2012 despite significant declines from peak market issuance levels moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global fixedincome markets and provide opportunities for longterm revenue growth 

the pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and similarly investors’ ability to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell which in the absence of the appropriate technology might not be readily or easily obtainable this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of both established and newer capital markets as technology provides broader access to worldwide markets it also results in a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk data analytics and related services additionally information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support moody’s continued expansion in developing markets 

an ongoing trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets moody’s believes that issuer use of global debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to traditional banking systems and that the trend of increased disintermediation will continue further disintermediation has continued because of the ongoing low interest rate environment and bank deleveraging which has encouraged a number of corporations and other entities to seek alternative funding in the bond markets 

 

 moody’s also observes disintermediation in key emerging markets where economic growth may outpace internal banking system capacity thus disintermediation is expected to continue over the longerterm with moody’s targeting investment and resources to those markets where disintermediation and bond issuance is expected to remain robust 

in the aftermath of the global financial crisis banking insurance and capital markets authorities promulgated a wide range of new regulations to restore stability and confidence in financial institutions under their oversight programs such as basel iii solvency ii and ccar — among many others — prompted banks insurers securities dealers and asset managers to invest in more robust risk management practices and systems many of these investments drew on expertise and tools offered by ma resulting in strong revenue growth in the postcrisis period as banking and capital markets continue to stabilize and with financial institutions better capitalized regulatorydriven demand for ma products will moderate nonetheless we expect that ma products and services that enable compliance with financial regulation will continue to be adopted by institutions worldwide prompted by periodic revisions to regulatory frameworks such as the basel capital adequacy protocols moreover having responded to regulatory imperatives financial institutions are increasingly seeking to leverage investments in regulatory compliance systems to gain business insights and frontoffice efficiencies ma is wellpositioned to realize revenue growth by assisting in these efforts to apply backoffice analytics in support of frontline business decisions finally in order to respond to other sources of demand and drive growth ma is actively investing in new products including enhanced data sets and improved delivery methods eg softwareasaservice these efforts will support broader distribution of ma’s capabilities deepen relationships with existing customers and facilitate more new customer acquisition 

legislative bodies and regulators in the us europe and other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of cras which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of mis removal of references to ratings in certain regulations or increased costs of doing business for mis therefore in order to broaden the potential for expansion of nonratings services moody’s reorganized in january 2008 into two distinct businesses mis consisting primarily of the ratings business and ma which conducts activities including the sale of credit research produced by mis and the production and sale of other economic and creditrelated products and services the reorganization broadened the opportunities for expansion by ma into activities that may have otherwise been restricted for mis due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities 

moody’s operations are subject to various risks as more fully described in part i item 1a “risk factors” inherent in conducting business on a global basis such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions 

competition 

mis competes with other cras and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research many users of mis’s ratings also have inhouse credit research capabilities mis’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is sp global ratings sp a division of sp global there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp while in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp mis’s competitors include fitch ratings dominion bond rating service dbrs am best company japan credit rating agency ltd kroll bond rating agency inc morningstar inc and eganjones ratings company in europe there are approximately 30 companies currently registered with esma which include both purely domestic european cras and international cras such as sp fitch and dbrs there are additional competitors in other regions and countries for example in china where moody’s participates through a joint venture these competitors include china lianhe credit rating co ltd shanghai brilliance credit rating  investors service co ltd dagong global credit rating co ltd and pengyuan credit rating co ltd 

ma competes broadly in the financial information industry against diversified competitors such as thomson reuters bloomberg sp global market intelligence fitch solutions dun  bradstreet ibm wolters kluwer fidelity national information services sas fiserv msci and ihs markit among others ma’s main competitors within rda include sp global market intelligence creditsights thomson reuters intex ihs markit blackrock solutions factset and other providers of fixed income analytics valuations economic data and research in ers ma faces competition from both large software providers such as ibm algorithmics fidelity national information services sas oracle misys oliver wyman verisk analytics and various other vendors and inhouse solutions within professional services ma competes with a host of financial training and education firms such as omega performance and providers of offshore research and analytical services such as evalueserve and crisil global research  analytics 

moody’s strategy 

moody’s corporate strategy is to be the world’s most respected authority serving financial risksensitive markets the key aspects to implement this strategy are to 

 

  

   

 moody’s will make investments to defend and enhance its core businesses in an attempt to position the company to fully capture market opportunities resulting from global debt capital market expansion and increased business investment spending moody’s will also make strategic investments to achieve scale in attractive financial information markets move into attractive product and service adjacencies where the company can leverage its brand extend its thought leadership and expand its geographic presence in high growth emerging markets 

to broaden the company’s potential ma provides a wide range of products and services to enable financial institutions corporations and governmental authorities to better manage risk as such ma adds to the company’s value proposition in three ways first ma’s subscription businesses provide a significant base of recurring revenue to offset cyclicality in ratings issuance volumes that may result in volatility in mis’s revenues second ma products and services such as financial training and professional services on research and risk management best practices provide opportunities for entry into emerging markets before banking systems and debt capital markets fully develop and thus present longterm growth opportunities for the ratings business finally ma’s integrated risk management software platform embeds moody’s solutions deep into the technology infrastructure of banks and insurance companies worldwide 

moody’s invests in initiatives to implement the company’s strategy including internally led organic development and targeted acquisitions example initiatives include 

 

  

  

  

  

 during 2017 moody’s continued to invest in and acquire complementary businesses in mis and ma in february 2017 moody’s acquired the structured finance data and analytics business of scdm a leading provider of analytical tools for participants in securitization markets in europe the acquisition further extended the geographic footprint of ma’s structured finance analytics business which includes extensive loan and poollevel data for securitized assets as well as cash flow analytics risk monitoring and credit modelling tools that cover all major asset classes worldwide in june 2017 moody’s invested in compstak a provider of commercial real estate lease information leveraging lease data provided by compstak will help ma expand its product offering and develop new products and technologies that serve the needs of commercial real estate finance and risk professionals in august 2017 moody’s completed the acquisition of bureau van dijk a global provider of business intelligence and company information for € 30 billion the acquisition of bureau van dijk extended ma’s offerings of small and medium size enterprise and private company information strengthening moody’s position as a leader in financial risk data and analytical insight also in august 2017 moody’s invested in securityscorecard a leading provider of cybersecurity ratings securityscorecard’s innovative cyber risk ratings data and analytics are used by information security risk management supply chain and compliance practitioners to assess and monitor their security posture and secure their partner and vendor ecosystem in november 2017 moody’s invested in rockport val a provider of cloudbased commercial real estate valuation and cash flow modeling tools 

regulation 

mis and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the us and in other countries including by state and local authorities thus existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company’s operations and the markets for securities that it rates additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered each of the existing adopted proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which moody’s operates 

the regulatory landscape has changed rapidly in recent years and continues to evolve in the eu the cra industry is registered and supervised through a paneuropean regulatory framework the european securities and markets authority has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered cra industry throughout the eu mis is a registered entity and is subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for 

 

 ratings of resecuritizations restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed reporting requirements to esma regarding fees and additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services in 2016 the commission published a report concluding that no new european legislation was needed for the industry at that time but that it would continue to monitor the credit rating industry and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation in addition from time to time esma publishes interpretive guidance or thematic reports regarding various aspects of the regulation over the past quarter two such reports have been published the first report provides further guidance from esma regarding the endorsement mechanism that cras will need to employ for those ratings that are produced outside of the eu but are used inside the eu by euregulated entities the second report discusses esma’s observations on cras fee practices 

separately on june 23 2016 the uk voted through a referendum to exit the eu the uk officially launched the exit process by submitting its article 50 letter to the eu informing it of the uk’s intention to exit the submission of this letter “starts the clock” on the negotiation of the terms of exit which will take up to two years the specifics regarding the “new relationship” or any transitional arrangements bridging the uk’s exit from its reengagement with the eu will only begin once the broad terms of exit have been agreed upon by all parties 

the longerterm impacts of the decision to leave the eu on the overall regulatory framework for the uk will depend in part on the relationship that the uk negotiates with the eu in the future in the interim however the uk’s markets regulator the financial conduct authority has said that all eu financial regulations will stay in place and that firms must continue to abide by their existing obligations as a consequence at this point in time there is no change to the regulatory framework under which mis operates and esma remains mis’s regulator both in the eu and in the uk 

in the us cras are subject to extensive regulation primarily pursuant to the reform act and the financial reform act the sec is required by these legislative acts to publish two annual reports to congress on nrsros the financial reform act requires the sec to examine each nrsro once a year and issue an annual report summarizing the examination findings among other requirements the annual report required by the reform act details the sec’s views on the state of competition transparency and conflicts of interests among nrsros among other requirements the sec voted in august 2014 to adopt its final rules for nrsros as required by the financial reform act the company has made and continues to make substantial it and other investments and has implemented the relevant compliance obligations 

in light of the regulations that have gone into effect in both the eu and the us as well as many other countries periodically and as a matter of course pursuant to their enabling legislation these regulatory authorities have and will continue to publish reports that describe their oversight activities over the industry in addition other legislation andor interpretation of existing regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future finally in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which mis operates the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of the company cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

us laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us including the reform act and the financial reform act these regulations are complex continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time see “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information these laws and regulations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these laws and regulations and any future rulemaking or court rulings could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs which moody’s may be unable to pass through to customers in addition there may be uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations the company may be required to incur significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines penalties or other sanctions legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on moody’s business and its customers’ businesses for example new laws and regulations may affect mis’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which mis’s ratings are developed assigned and communicated affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate impact the demand for mis’s ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business including by restricting or mandating business models for rating agencies further speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect moody’s stock price although these legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally they may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on moody’s operations profitability and competitiveness the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized 

financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

in addition to the extensive and evolving us laws and regulations governing the industry foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings in particular the eu has adopted a common regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the eu as a result esma has direct supervisory authority for cras in the eu and has the power to take enforcement action against noncompliant cras including through the issuance of public notices withdrawal of registration and in some cases the imposition of fines 

mis is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection in the eu applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations and restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed additional procedural and substantive requirements include conditions for the issuance of credit ratings rules regarding the organization of cras restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest including fees that are based on costs and are nondiscriminatory and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments compliance with the eu regulations may increase costs of operations and could have a significant negative effect on moody’s operations profitability or ability to compete or the markets for its products and services including in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict in addition exposure to increased liability under the eu regulations may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact moody’s results of operations 

 

 the eu and other jurisdictions engage in rulemaking on an ongoing basis that could significantly impact operations or the markets for moody’s products and services including regulations extending to products and services not currently regulated and regulations affecting the need for debt securities to be rated expansion of supervisory remit to include noneu ratings used for regulatory purposes increasing the level of competition in the market for credit ratings establishing criteria for credit ratings or limiting the entities authorized to provide credit ratings moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations and the effect that they will have on moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant financial reforms in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company faces exposure to litigation and government regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to rating opinions and other business practices 

moody’s faces exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to mis’s ratings actions as well as other business practices and products if the market value of creditdependent instruments declines or defaults whether as a result of difficult economic times turbulent markets or otherwise the number of investigations and legal proceedings that moody’s faces could increase significantly parties who invest in securities rated by mis may pursue claims against mis or moody’s for losses they face in their portfolios moody’s has faced numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation government investigations and inquiries concerning events linked to the us subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during the financial crisis of 20072008 legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues and any of these proceedings investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments damages fines penalties or activity restrictions risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the us in addition new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time furthermore to the extent that moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by moody’s increase substantially as does the risk of an adverse outcome additionally as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses moody’s may change its accounting estimates which could require moody’s to record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the company currently faces due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought there is a risk that moody’s will be subject to judgments settlements fines penalties or other adverse results that could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to legal economic operational and regulatory risks of operating in multiple jurisdictions 

moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the company operates may have an impact on the company’s business for example economic uncertainty in the eurozone or elsewhere could affect the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas in addition operations abroad expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 additionally moody’s is subject to complex us foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the uk bribery act of 2010 and other antibribery and anticorruption laws although the company has implemented internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices such measures may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that the company has violated antibribery or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on moody’s reputation its ability to attract and retain employees its business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located including new york city the location of moody’s headquarters major cities worldwide in which moody’s has offices and locations in china used for certain moody’s back office work this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure whether or not controlled by the company including the company’s electronic delivery systems data center facilities or the internet used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business many of the company’s products and services are delivered electronically and the company’s customers depend on the company’s ability to receive store process transmit and otherwise rapidly handle very substantial quantities of data and transactions on computerbased networks the company’s customers also depend on the continued capacity reliability and security of the company’s telecommunications data centers networks and other electronic delivery systems including its websites and connections to the internet the company’s employees also depend on these systems for internal use any significant failure compromise cyberbreach interruption or a significant slowdown of operations of the company’s infrastructure whether due to human error capacity constraints hardware failure or defect natural disasters fire power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political unrest war or otherwise may impair the company’s ability to deliver its products and services 

moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful the company relies on thirdparty providers to provide certain essential services while the company believes that such providers are reliable the company has limited control over the performance of such providers to the extent any of the company’s thirdparty providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fails to adequately expand its services to meet the company’s needs and the needs of the company’s customers the company could experience lower revenues and higher costs additionally although the company maintains processes to prevent detect and recover from a disruption the company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations such persons’ ability to service and interact with moody’s customers may suffer the company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the company’s failure or the failure of a third party to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions a disruption to moody’s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its reputation business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees in the 

 

 company’s computer systems and networks and in those of its third party vendors the cyber risks the company faces range from cyberattacks common to most industries to more advanced threats that target the company because of its prominence in the global marketplace or due to its ratings of sovereign debt breaches of moody’s or moody’s vendors’ technology and systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data material interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s or such vendors’ web sites applications data processing or disruption of other business operations or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the company including information about moody’s business employees or customers as well as sensitive personally identifiable information “pii” the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft measures that moody’s takes to avoid detect mitigate or recover from material incidents can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or may become ineffective to conduct its operations the company regularly moves data across national borders and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to moody’s is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches becomes effective in may 2018 additionally other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time 

the company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security measures in order to protect its systems and data including employee training disaster plans and technical defenses in order to protect its systems and data the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threats despite the company’s best efforts it is not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers any material breaches of cybersecurity or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the company’s systems or those of the company’s third parties even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could cause the company to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard the company’s customers’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment levels and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the us and world financial markets furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional cras such as mis a majority of moody’s creditratingbased revenue is transactionbased and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings the tax act in addition to other changes to us tax laws and policy could negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued in the us for example the tax act will limit deductibility on interest payments and significantly reduce the tax cost associated with the repatriation of cash held outside the us both of which could negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued conditions that reduce issuers’ ability or willingness to issue debt securities such as market volatility declining growth currency devaluations or other adverse economic trends reduce the number and dollarequivalent volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees moody’s earns in its ratings business 

economic and government factors such as a longterm continuation of difficult economic conditions or a reemergence of the sovereign debt crisis in europe may have an adverse impact on the company’s business future debt issuances also could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates widening credit spreads regulatory and political developments growth in the use of alternative sources of credit and defaults by significant issuers declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient and cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term due in part to rent technology compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further costreduction initiatives including those under

 

 taken to date could make it difficult for the company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings volatility in the financial markets including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition which the company may not be able to successfully offset with cost reductions 

the company faces increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

there is price competition in the credit rating research credit risk management markets research and analytical services and financial training and certification services moody’s faces competition globally from other cras and from investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions in research as well as from inhouse research operations competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services as well as increased competition from nonnrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors at the same time a challenging business environment and consolidation among customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and reduce the company’s customer base weak economic growth intensifies competitive pricing pressures and can result in customers’ use of free or lowercost information that is available from alternative sources while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services it may lose market share if its pricing is not sufficiently competitive in addition the reform act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies the formation of additional nrsros may increase pricing and competitive pressures furthermore in some of the countries in which moody’s operates governments may provide financial or other support to local rating agencies any inability of moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to reputation and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be significantly impacted factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities the timing and nature of changes in ratings a major compliance failure negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings regulators and legislative bodies including as to the ratings process and its implementation with respect to one or more securities and intentional or unintentional misrepresentations of moody’s products and services in advertising materials public relations information social media or other external communications operational errors whether by moody’s or a moody’s competitor could also harm the reputation of the company or the credit rating industry damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on moody’s business operating results and financial condition as well as on the company’s ability to find suitable candidates for acquisition 

the introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

the markets for credit ratings research credit risk management services research and analytical services and financial training and certification services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer demands and evolving regulatory requirements industry standards and market preferences the ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share moody’s competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources brand recognition market experience and technological expertise and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may position price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by moody’s moody’s also competes indirectly against consulting firms and technology and information providers these indirect competitors could in the future choose to compete directly with moody’s cease doing business with moody’s or change the terms under which it does business with moody’s in a way that could negatively impact our business in addition customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and services and its growth prospects further the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive internet information may reduce the demand for moody’s products and services for example in december 2016 esma launched a database providing access to free current information on certain credit ratings and rating outlooks moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors any inability of moody to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures may negatively impact the company 

moody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract high quality 

 

 employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing industries as greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies in the future moody’s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that could adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis there is a risk that even if the company invests significant resources in attempting to attract train and retain qualified personnel it will not succeed in its efforts and its business could be harmed 

moody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of raymond w mcdaniel jr the president and chief executive officer and other senior officers and key employees the loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions or internal technology investments may not produce anticipated results exposing the company to future significant impairment charges relating to its goodwill intangible assets or property and equipment 

moody’s has entered into and expects to continue to enter into acquisition disposition or other strategic transactions and expects to make various investments to strengthen its business and grow the company such transactions as well as internal technology investments present significant challenges and risks the market for acquisition targets dispositions and other strategic transactions is highly competitive especially in light of industry consolidation which may affect moody’s ability to complete such transactions if moody’s is unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if opportunities for expansion do not arise its business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected additionally we make significant investments in technology including software developed for internaluse which is timeintensive and complex to implement such investments may not be successful or may not result in the anticipated benefits resulting in asset writeoffs 

in august 2017 moody’s acquired bureau van dijk for 35420 million the anticipated growth synergies and other strategic objectives of the bureau van dijk acquisition as well as other completed transactions may not be fully realized and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations technologies and new employees the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the company prior to closing a transaction unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures scrutiny from competition and antitrust authorities failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business future developments may impair the value of purchased goodwill or intangible assets diverting management’s focus from other business operations failing to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls procedures and policies challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business and for foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected as a result the failure of acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

at december 31 2017 moody’s had 37532 million of goodwill and 16316 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet both of which increased significantly due to the acquisition of bureau van dijk approximately 92 of the goodwill and intangible assets reside in the ma business including those related to bureau van dijk and are allocated to the five reporting units within ma rda ers financial services training and certifications moody’s analytics knowledge services and bureau van dijk the remaining 8 of goodwill and intangible assets reside in mis and primarily relate to icra failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in a significant asset impairment charge which would result in a noncash charge to operating expenses goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be especially difficult in periods of market or economic uncertainty and turmoil and requires significant management estimates and judgment in addition the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty an asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s compliance and risk management programs may not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

moody’s operates in a number of countries and as a result the company is required to comply and quickly adapt with numerous international and us federal state and local laws and regulations the company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

 

 including anticorruption laws is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel moody’s policies and procedures to identify evaluate and manage the company’s risks including risks resulting from acquisitions may not be fully effective and moody’s employees or agents may engage in misconduct fraud or other errors it is not always possible to deter such errors and the precautions the company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases if moody’s employees violate its policies or if the company’s risk management methods are not effective the company could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of the company’s employees fines penalties regulatory sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or other penalties and may suffer harm to its reputation financial condition and operating results 

legal protections for the company’s intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or available to protect the company’s competitive advantages 

moody’s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary failure to protect the company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the company’s ability to compete effectively businesses the company acquires also involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges the company faces in protecting its strategic advantage in addition the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets on january 6 2015 a rule with direct relevance to the cra industry was published in the official journal of the european union regarding the types of information that cras are to provide about certain ratings those that were paid for by issuers for publication on a central website administered by esma the european ratings platform this rule directly relates to the company’s intellectual property as it requires that the company provide proprietary information at no cost that the company currently sells which could result in lost revenue esma launched the european rating platform for public use on december 1 2016 

unauthorized third parties may also try to obtain and use technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary it is also possible that moody’s competitors or other entities could obtain patents related to the types of products and services that moody’s offers and attempt to require moody’s to stop developing or marketing the products or services to modify or redesign the products or services to avoid infringing or to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services even if moody’s attempts to assert or protect its intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful these risks and the cost time and resources needed to address them may increase as the company’s business grows and its profile rises in countries with intellectual property regimes that are less protective than the rules and regulations applied in the united states 

the company is dependent on the use of thirdparty software data hosted solutions data centers cloud and network infrastructure together “third party technology” and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or service offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

moody’s relies on third party technology in connection with its product development and offerings and operations the company depends on the ability of third party technology providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the third party technology moody’s uses may become obsolete incompatible with future versions of the company’s products unavailable or fail to operate effectively and moody’s business could be adversely affected if the company is unable to timely or effectively replace such third party technology the company also monitors its use of third party technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements despite the company’s efforts the company cannot ensure that such third parties will permit moody’s use in the future resulting in increased third party technology acquisition costs and loss of rights in addition the company’s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for third party technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to third party technology are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also moody’s competitors increasing the risks noted above if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in tax rates or tax rules could affect future results 

as a global company moody’s is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries and jurisdictions as a result our effective tax rate is determined based on the pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate moody’s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where moody’s faces higher tax rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which moody’s is not able to realize the related tax benefit or changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in the tax accounting and other laws treaties regulations policies and administrative practices or changes to their interpretation or enforcement including changes applicable to multinational corporations such as the base erosion profit shifting project being conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european union’s state aid rulings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition the tax act made significant changes to the us federal tax laws many aspects of the new legislation are currently uncertain or unclear and may not be clarified for some time as 

 

 additional regulatory guidance is issued interpreting or clarifying the tax act or if the tax accounting rules are modified there may be adjustments or changes to our estimate of the mandatory onetime deemed repatriation tax liability “transition tax” on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries recorded in 2017 additional regulatory guidance may also affect our expected future effective tax rates and tax assets and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition furthermore the tax act may impact the volume of debt securities issued as discussed in the risk factor changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment levels and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

in addition moody’s is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and the company is experiencing increased scrutiny as its business grows moody’s regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits however developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect the company although the company believes its tax estimates and accruals are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its historical income tax provisions accruals and unrecognized tax benefits which could materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows and financial condition

the company 

moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings ii credit capital markets and economic research data and analytical tools iii software solutions that support financial risk management activities iv quantitatively derived credit scores v financial services training and certification services vi offshore financial research and analytical services and vii company information and business intelligence products moody’s reports in two reportable segments mis and ma 

mis the credit rating agency publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors additionally mis earns revenue from certain nonratingsrelated operations which consist primarily of financial instruments pricing services in the asiapacific region as well as revenue from icra’s nonratings operations the revenue from these operations is included in the mis other lob and is not material to the results of the mis segment 

the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets within its rda business ma distributes research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies and commentary on topical creditrelated events the rda business also produces economic research and data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores as well as business intelligence and company information products within its ers business ma provides software solutions as well as related risk management services the ps business provides offshore research and analytical services and financial training and certification programs 

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets including the estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets pension and other retirement benefits and utbs actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable 

pursuant to asc topic 605 when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available third party evidence if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 

the company’s products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under asc topic 605 the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control in instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit 

 

 the company determines whether its selling price in a multielement transaction meets the vsoe criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately the price established by management having the relevant authority to establish such a price in instances where the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range or only having a limited sales history the company attempts to establish tpe for deliverables the company determines whether tpe exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers however due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing possible differences in its market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the company may contain a significant level of differentiation andor customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained the company generally is unable to reliably determine tpe based on the selling price hierarchy established by asc topic 605 when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe the company will establish an esp esp is the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis the company establishes its best estimate of esp considering internal factors relevant to is pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives standalone sales prices of similar products percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service and customer segment and geography additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend the company reviews its determination of vsoe tpe and esp on an annual basis or more frequently as needed 

in the mis segment revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is delivered to the issuer revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed generally one year in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities structured credit international residential mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities which was approximately 24 years on a weighted average basis at december 31 2017 at december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately 1401 million 1330 million and 1210 million 

multiple element revenue arrangements in the mis segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees the company generally uses esp in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the company rarely provides initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for initial ratings 

mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 accounts receivable included approximately 270 million 250 million and 240 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings furthermore for certain annual monitoring services fees are not invoiced until the end of the annual monitoring period and revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period at december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 accounts receivable included approximately 1850 million 1591 million and 1464 million respectively relating to accrued annual monitoring service revenue 

in the ma segment products and services offered by the company include software licenses and related maintenance subscriptions and professional services revenue from subscription based products such as research and data subscriptions and certain softwarebased credit risk management subscription products is recognized ratably over the related subscription period which is principally one year revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are performed a large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of november december and january 

products and services offered within the ma segment are sold either standalone or together in various combinations in instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and nonsoftware deliverables revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above 

if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using vsoe in the instances where the company is not able to determine vsoe for all of the deliverables of an arrangement the company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its vsoe and the 

 

 residual revenue to the delivered elements if the company is unable to determine vsoe for an undelivered element the company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the company has delivered all of the elements or when vsoe has been determined for the undelivered elements in cases where software implementation services are considered essential and vsoe of fair value exists for postcontract customer support “pcs” once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software license and service revenue is recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as implementation services are performed while pcs is recognized over the coverage period if vsoe of fair value does not exist for pcs once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin basis until essential services are complete at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining pcs coverage period if vsoe does not exist for pcs at the beginning of an arrangement but is established during implementation revenue not recognized due to the absence of vsoe will be recognized on a cumulative basis 

accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue based on historical experience and current conditions such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account writeoffs are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and invoice adjustment experience as well as the current aging status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the company’s consolidated results of operations 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities 

for claims litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range in other instances where a loss is reasonably possible management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss but discloses the contingency if material as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation regulatory governmental investigations and inquiries enforcement and similar matters and contingencies particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also cannot predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition however in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time 

the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary insures the company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation employment practices litigation employee medical claims and terrorism for which the claims are not material to the company in addition for claim years 2008 and 2009 the insurance subsidiary insured the company for defense costs 

 

 related to professional liability claims for matters insured by the company’s insurance subsidiary moody’s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion the company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management’s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates defense costs for matters not selfinsured by the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided 

for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic 740 of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

as of july 31 of each year moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 

the company has seven primary reporting units two within the company’s ratings business one for the icra business and one that encompasses all of moody’s other ratings operations and five reporting units within ma rda ers fstc maks and bureau van dijk the rda reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools the ers reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions and also provides advanced actuarial software for the life insurance industry these products and services are primarily delivered via software that is licensed on a perpetual basis or sold on a subscription basis the fstc reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and implementation services the maks reporting unit provides offshore research and analytical services the bureau van dijk reporting unit consists of the newly acquired bureau van dijk business which was acquired on august 10 2017 and primarily provides business intelligence and company information products 

the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a twostep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level in the first step the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount if a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist the company is not required to perform further testing if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach the company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years at july 31 2017 the company performed a qualitative assessment on all reporting units except for maks which resulted in no indicators of impairment of goodwill 

in january 2017 there was a management change in the maks business a quantitative impairment assessment for the maks reporting unit was performed as of july 31 2017 to reflect the completion of a new strategic plan for this reporting unit under new management the company’s annual strategic plan is completed in the third quarter of each year this quantitative assessment resulted in no impairment of goodwill for the maks reporting unit at july 31 2017 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and appropriate comparable market metrics however as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from these estimates in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 

 

 sensitivity analyses and key assumptions for deriving the fair value of a reporting unit 

the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december 31 2017 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit

the following is a discussion regarding the company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units excluding icra as of the date of each reporting unit’s last quantitative assessment july 31 2017 for maks july 31 2016 for the remaining reporting units as icra is a publicly traded company in india the company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization 

the fair value of each reporting unit excluding icra was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples the dcf analysis requires significant estimates including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that is based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition 

the sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions described below are as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology that requires significant management judgment 

 

  

  

 amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no such events or changes during 2017 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the company’s reporting units may not be recoverable this determination was made based on continued growth consistent with operating and strategic plans for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides 

pension and other retirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these significant assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

 the discount rates used to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31 2017 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with thirdparty actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s retirement plans additionally the company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released mortality improvement scale mp2017 to accompany the rp2014 mortality tables to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the society of actuaries 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise excluding differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual returns on plan assets the company amortizes as a component of annual pension expense total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets for moody’s retirement plans the total actuarial losses as of december 31 2017 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 1232 million and moody’s expects to recognize a net periodic expense of 60 million in 2018 related to the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded us pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under asc topic 715 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2017 the company has an unrecognized asset loss of 161 million of which 21 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2019 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2018 income before provision for income taxes these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2018 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s retirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  

 a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2018 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be approximately 31 million in 2018 a decrease compared to the 326 million recognized in 2017 

 

 income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utbs the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

for utbs asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utbs and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was signed into law which resulted in significant changes to us corporate tax laws the tax act includes a mandatory onetime deemed repatriation tax “transition tax” on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and reduces the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 due to the complexities involved in applying the provisions of the tax act in 2017 the company recorded a provisional estimate of 2473 million related to the transition tax a portion of this amount will be payable over eight years starting in 2018 and will not accrue interest also in 2017 a provisional estimate of 562 million was recorded decreasing net deferred tax assets resulting from the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate the above provisional estimates may be impacted by a number of additional considerations including but not limited to the issuance of regulations and our ongoing analysis of the new law 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets valuation of investments in affiliates and the estimated lives of amortizable intangible assets management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s 

reportable segments 

the company is organized into two reportable segments at december 31 2017 mis and ma 

the mis segment is comprised primarily of all of the company’s ratings operations consisting of five lobs—cfg sfg fig ppif and mis other the ratings lobs generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide the mis other lob consists of certain nonratings operations managed by mis which consists of nonrating revenue from icra and fixed income pricing service operations in the asiapacific region 

the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets as well as serving as provider of business intelligence and company information the ma segment consists of three lines of business—rda ers and ps the results of operations for ma and revenue for the rda lob for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2017 include the financial results from bureau van dijk which was acquired on august 10 2017 

the following is a discussion of the results of operations of the company and its reportable segments total mis revenue and total ma expenses include the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content data and products developed by mis the royalty rate charged by mis approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content data and products developed by mis total ma revenue and total mis expenses include intersegment fees charged to mis from ma for the 

 

 use of certain ma products and services in mis’s ratings process these fees charged by ma are generally equal to the costs incurred by ma to provide these products and services overhead charges and corporate expenses that exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment additionally overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company that benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a revenuesplit methodology overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy information technology and support staff such as finance human resources and information technology 

beginning in the third quarter of 2017 in conjunction with the acquisition of bureau van dijk the company modified its definition of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps to exclude the impact of amortization of all acquisitionrelated intangible assets refer to the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” of this management discussion and analysis for further information regarding this measure

nonus revenue of 6298 million in 2016 was 142 million higher than in 2015 reflecting growth in rda and ers partially offset by unfavorable changes in fx rates the growth in rda primarily reflects strength in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data in the asiapacific region the increase in ers was primarily due to higher revenue from the assets liability  capital and credit assessment  origination product verticals in the emea region coupled with revenue from the acquisition of ggy these increases were partially offset by declines in the credit assessment  origination product vertical in the americas region 

global rda revenue of 6676 million which comprised 54 of total external ma revenue in both 2016 and 2015 increased 412 million or 7 over the prior year period excluding unfavorable changes in fx rates rda revenue increased 9 over the prior year the growth reflected strength in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data as well as higher revenue within sav and ecca the growth compared to 2015 also reflects the benefits of pricing increases in the us revenue of 3893 million increased 374 million compared to 2015 nonus revenue of 2783 million increased 38 million compared to the prior year

operating and sga expenses in 2016 increased 705 million compared to 2015 the expense growth primarily reflects an approximate 68 million increase in compensation costs primarily due to higher headcount to support business growth as well as headcount from the acquisition of ggy coupled with annual merit increases

market risk 

foreign exchange risk 

moody’s maintains a presence in 40 countries outside the us in 2017 approximately 40 and 39 of both the company’s revenue and expenses respectively were denominated in functional currencies other than the us dollar principally in the british pound and the euro as such the company is exposed to market risk from changes in fx rates as of december 31 2017 approximately 81 of moody’s assets were located outside the us making the company susceptible to fluctuations in fx rates the effects of translating assets and liabilities of nonus operations with nonus functional currencies to the us dollar are charged or credited to oci 

the effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency are charged to other nonoperating income expense net in the company’s consolidated statements of operations accordingly the company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency the following table shows the impact to the fair value of the forward contracts if foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar 

 

  

 the change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by fx revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency 

also the company has designated € 500 million of the 2015 senior notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate fx exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries if the euro were to strengthen 10 relative to the us dollar there would be an approximate 56 million unfavorable adjustment to oci related to this net investment hedge this adjustment would be offset by favorable translation adjustments on the company’s euro net investment in subsidiaries 

moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of 12 billion at december 31 2017 included 1 billion located outside the us approximately 62 of the company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december 31 2017 were held in currencies other than usd as such a decrease in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar particularly the euro and gbp could reduce the reported amount of usd cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

credit and interest rate risk 

the company’s interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates the company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed rate of interest on certain of its borrowings to a floating rate based on the 3month libor these swaps are adjusted to fair market value 

 

 based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing while net interest payments are recorded as interest expenseincome in the company’s consolidated statement of operations a hypothetical change of 100bps in the liborbased swap rate would result in an approximate 26 million change to the fair value of these interest rate swaps 

additional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k 

moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in highquality investmentgrade securities within and outside the us with maturities of three months or less when purchased the company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds money market deposit accounts certificates of deposit and issuers of highgrade commercial paper and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer shortterm investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit

 cash and shortterm investments held in nonus jurisdictions 

the company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 12 billion at december 31 2017 included approximately 1 billion located outside of the us approximately 27 of the company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments is denominated in euros and british pounds the company manages both its us and international cash flow to maintain sufficient liquidity in all regions to effectively meet its operating needs 

other material future cash requirements 

the company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow in 2018 cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the company’s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements the company may also borrow from various sources 

the company remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by investing in growing areas of the business reinvesting in ratings quality initiatives making selective acquisitions repurchasing stock and paying a dividend all in a manner consistent with maintaining sufficient liquidity after giving effect to any additional indebtedness that may be incurred 

in january 2018 the board of directors of the company declared a quarterly dividend of 044 per share of moody’s common stock payable march 12 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 20 2018 the continued payment of dividends 

 

 at this rate or at all is subject to the discretion of the board in december 2015 the board authorized 10 billion of share repurchase authority which had a remaining repurchase authority of approximately 05 million at december 31 2017 fullyear 2018 total share repurchases are expected to be approximately 200 million subject to available cash market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions 

the company has future cash requirements including operating leases and debt service and principal payments as noted in the tables that follow as well as future payments related to the transition tax under the tax act 

indebtedness 

at december 31 2017 moody’s had 55 billion of outstanding debt and approximately 09 billion of additional capacity available under the company’s cp program which is backstopped by the 2015 facility as more fully discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2017 the company was in compliance with all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements all of the company’s longterm debt agreements contain cross default provisions which state that default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable at december 31 2017 there were no such cross defaults 

the repayment schedule for the company’s borrowings outstanding at december 31 2017 is as follows 

 

 management may consider pursuing additional longterm financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations share repurchases and other strategic opportunities which would result in higher financing costs 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2017 moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where moody’s is the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such moody’s is not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships

  nongaap financial measures 

in addition to its reported results moody’s has included in this mda certain adjusted results that the sec defines as “nongaap financial measures” management believes that such nongaap financial measures when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing periodtoperiod comparisons of the company’s performance facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking these nongaap measures as defined by the company are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies furthermore these nongaap measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other gaap measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the company below are descriptions of the company’s nongaap financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the nongaap measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure 

adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin 

the company presents adjusted operating income because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating performance of moody’s adjusted operating income excludes depreciation and amortization acquisitionrelated expenses restructuring and the settlement charge depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets acquisitionrelated expenses consist of expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of bureau van dijk and are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the multiyear integration effort acquisition related expenses from previous acquisitions were not material restructuring charges are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies the settlement charge is a material nonrecurring event that is not expected to recur in the future at this magnitude management believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization acquisitionrelated expenses restructuring and the settlement charge as detailed in the reconciliation below allows for an additional perspective on the company’s operating results from period to period and across companies the company defines adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by revenue 

 

 adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps attributable to moody’s common shareholders 

beginning in the third quarter of 2017 the company modified this adjusted measure to exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different ages and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets furthermore the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies also management believes that excluding acquisitionrelated amortization expense provides additional perspective when comparing operating results from period to period and with both acquisitive and nonacquisitive peer companies furthermore us tax reform as well as changes in statutory tax rates in belgium were both enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting in significant adjustments to the tax provision the company modified the adjusted measures to exclude these adjustments to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted eps from period to period and across companies in addition to excluding acquisitionrelated amortization expense and the effects of us tax reform as well as the statutory tax rate change in belgium current and prioryear adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the ccxi gain the purchase price hedge gain acquisitionrelated expenses restructuring charges and the settlement charge the company excludes these items to provide additional perspective on the company’s operating results from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods additionally the acquisitionrelated expenses are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the multiyear integration effort relating to bureau van dijk acquisitionrelated expenses from previous acquisitions were not material 

 

 below is a reconciliation of this measure to its most directly comparable us gaap amount 

 

  

  

   

  

 free cash flow  

the company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital additions management believes that free cash flow is a useful metric in assessing the company’s cash flows to service debt pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases management deems capital expenditures essential to the company’s product and service innovations and maintenance of moody’s operational capabilities accordingly capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of moody’s cash flow below is a reconciliation of the company’s net cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and types of securities or other obligations outstanding beginning in mid2007 there was a severe market disruption and associated financial crisis both in the developed and emerging markets resulting in a global decline in issuance activity for some significant asset classes and weak economic performance in advanced economies since this financial crisis many markets and economies have recovered and moody’s believes the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixedincome market and related financial information market which includes information such as credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

 

 moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 moody’s is well positioned to benefit from continued growth in global fixedincome market activity and a more informed use of credit ratings as well as research and related analytical products in an environment with heightened attention to credit risk analysis and management moody’s expects that these developments will support continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

strong secular trends should continue to provide longterm growth opportunities moody’s key growth drivers include debt market issuance driven by global gdp growth continued disintermediation of fixedincome markets in both developed and emerging economies driving issuance and demand for new products and services growth in ma driven by further penetration into ma’s client base and expansion of bank and insurance risk regulatory requirements pricing opportunities aligned with value and advances in information technology 

growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates business investment spending corporate refinancing needs merger and acquisition activity issuer profits consumer borrowing levels and securitization activity rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the dollarequivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets mis’s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decisions however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank deposit ratings insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings and other areas partially mitigate mis’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixedincome markets furthermore the strong growth seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid1990’s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010 before stabilizing in 2011 with moody’s experiencing revenue growth in this market beginning in 2012 despite significant declines from peak market issuance levels moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global fixedincome markets and provide opportunities for longerterm revenue growth 

the pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and similarly investors’ ability to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell which in the absence of the appropriate technology might not be readily or easily obtainable this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of both established and newer capital markets as technology provides broader access to worldwide markets it also results in a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk data analytics and related services additionally information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support moody’s continued expansion in developing markets 

an ongoing trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets moody’s believes that issuer use of global debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to traditional banking systems and that the trend of increased disintermediation will continue further disintermediation has continued because of the ongoing low interest rate environment and bank deleveraging which has encouraged a number of corporations and other entities to seek alternative funding in the bond markets 

moody’s also observes disintermediation in key emerging markets where economic growth may outpace internal banking system capacity thus disintermediation is expected to continue over the longerterm with moody’s targeting investment and resources to those markets where disintermediation and bond issuance is expected to remain robust 

 

 in response to the credit market disruptions beginning in mid2007 ongoing volatility in the global capital markets and new regulatory requirements financial institutions are investing in people processes and systems to enhance risk management and compliance functions regulations such as the financial reform act basel ii basel iii solvency ii and others may stimulate demand for ma products financial institutions are also investing in advanced qualitative and quantitative tools and services to support their management of complex balance sheets and diverse portfolios as well as operating costs ma offers a suite of risk management products and services to address these needs including but not limited to risk management software economic analysis training and professional services 

legislative bodies and regulators in the us europe and other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of cras which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of mis removal of references to ratings in certain regulations or increased costs of doing business for mis therefore in order to broaden the potential for expansion of nonratings services moody’s reorganized in january 2008 into two distinct businesses mis consisting primarily of the ratings business and ma which conducts activities including the sale of credit research produced by mis and the production and sale of other economic and creditrelated products and services the reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by ma into activities that may have otherwise been restricted for mis due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities 

moody’s operations are subject to various risks as more fully described in part i item 1a “risk factors” inherent in conducting business on a global basis such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions 

competition 

mis competes with other cras and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research many users of mis’s ratings also have inhouse credit research capabilities mis’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is sp global ratings sp a division of sp global there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp while in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp mis’s competitors include fitch ratings dominion bond rating service dbrs am best company japan credit rating agency ltd kroll bond rating agency inc morningstar inc and eganjones ratings company in europe there are approximately 30 companies currently registered with esma which include both purely domestic european cras and international cras such as sp fitch and dbrs there are additional competitors in other regions and countries for example in china where moody’s participates through a joint venture these competitors include china lianhe credit rating co ltd shanghai brilliance credit rating  investors service co ltd dagong global credit rating co ltd and pengyuan credit rating co ltd

moody’s strategy 

moody’s corporate strategy is to be the world’s most respected authority serving financial risksensitive markets the key aspects to implement this strategy are to 

 

  

  

 moody’s will make investments to defend and enhance its core businesses in an attempt to position the company to fully capture market opportunities resulting from global debt capital market expansion and increased business investment spending moody’s will also make strategic investments to achieve scale in attractive financial information markets move into attractive product and service adjacencies where the company can leverage its brand extend its thought leadership and expand its geographic presence in high growth emerging markets 

 

 to broaden the company’s potential ma provides a wide range of products and services to enable financial institutions to better manage risk as such ma adds to the company’s value proposition in three ways first ma’s subscription businesses provide a significant base of recurring revenue to offset cyclicality in ratings issuance volumes that may result in volatility to mis’s revenues second ma products and services such as financial training and professional services on research and risk management best practices provide opportunities for entry into emerging markets before debt capital markets fully develop and thus present longterm growth opportunities for the ratings business finally ma’s integrated risk management software platform embeds moody’s solutions deep into the technology infrastructure of banks and insurance companies worldwide 

moody’s invests in initiatives to implement the company’s strategy including internallyled organic development and targeted acquisitions example initiatives include 

 

  

  

  

  

 during 2016 moody’s continued to acquire complementary businesses in mis and ma in february 2016 moody’s made an investment in finagraph which is a provider of automated financial data collection and business intelligence solutions in conjunction with this investment moody’s expects to broaden its offering of credit risk solutions covering smes including moody’s analytics lending cloud software and default risk models in march 2016 moody’s acquired ggy a leading provider of advanced actuarial software for the global life insurance industry combined with moody’s analytics’ insurance risk products the ggy acquisition creates an industryleading enterprise risk offering for global life insurers and reinsurers in july 2016 moody’s acquired full ownership of korea investors service kis one of korea’s leading providers of domestic credit ratings kis had been a majorityowned affiliate of moody’s investors service since 2001 and will continue to operate as an independent affiliate of moody’s investors service as part of the transaction moody’s also gained majority ownership in kis pricing which had been a majorityowned subsidiary of kis and is a provider of pricing services and analytics for fixed income and other local securities in september 2016 moody’s announced a collaboration with euler hermes rating gmbh ehrg a hamburgbased ratings agency and subsidiary of euler hermes to provide credit ratings for smes across europe as part of the collaboration moody’s acquired a 499 stake in ehrg 

regulation 

mis and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the us and in other countries including by state and local authorities thus existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company’s operations and the markets for securities that it rates additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered each of the existing adopted proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which moody’s operates 

the regulatory landscape has changed rapidly in recent years and continues to evolve in the eu the cra industry is registered and supervised through a paneuropean regulatory framework the european securities and markets authority has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered cra industry throughout the eu mis is a registered entity and is subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed reporting requirements to esma regarding fees and additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services cra3 also requires that esma and the european commission produce several reports on the industry’s structure and the use of ratings in october 2015 esma published its reports wherein it acknowledged the impact of regulation on the industry and stated that it will continue to monitor the industry structure over the next three to five years on october 19 2016 the commission published its analysis reaching a conclusion similar to esma’s that no new legislation is needed for the industry at this time but that it will continue to monitor the credit rating market and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation 

separately on june 23 2016 the uk voted through a referendum to exit the eu the longerterm impacts of the decision to leave the eu on the overall regulatory framework for the uk will depend in part on the relationship that the uk negotiates with the eu in the future in the interim however the uk’s markets regulator the financial conduct authority has said that all eu financial regulations 

 

 will stay in place and that firms must continue to abide by their existing obligations as a consequence at this point in time there is no change to the regulatory framework under which mis operates and esma remains mis’s regulator both in the eu and in the uk 

in the us cras are subject to extensive regulation primarily pursuant to the reform act and the financial reform act the sec is required by these legislative acts to publish two annual reports to congress on nrsros the financial reform act requires the sec to examine each nrsro once a year and issue an annual report summarizing the examination findings among other requirements the annual report required by the reform act details the sec’s views on the state of competition transparency and conflicts of interests among nrsros among other requirements the sec voted in august 2014 to adopt its final rules for nrsros as required by the financial reform act the company has made and continues to make substantial it and other investments and has implemented the relevant compliance obligations 

in light of the regulations that have gone into effect in both the eu and the us as well as many other countries from time to time and as a matter of course pursuant to their enabling legislation these regulatory authorities have and will continue to publish reports that describe their oversight activities over the industry in addition other legislation andor interpretation of existing regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future finally in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which mis operates the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of the company cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

 item 1a   risk factors tableend the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occur moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on form 10k 

us laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us including the reform act and the financial reform act these regulations are complex continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time see “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information these laws and regulations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these laws and regulations and any future rulemaking or court rulings could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs which moody’s may be unable to pass through to customers in addition there may be uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations the company may be required to incur significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines penalties or other sanctions legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on moody’s business and its customers’ businesses for example new laws and regulations may affect mis’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which mis’s ratings are developed assigned and communicated affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate impact the demand for mis’s ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business including by restricting or mandating business models for rating agencies further speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect moody’s stock price although these recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally they may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on moody’s operations profitability and competitiveness the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized 

financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

in addition to the extensive and evolving us laws and regulations governing the industry foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings in particular the eu has adopted a common regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the eu as a result esma has direct supervisory authority for cras in the eu and has the power to take enforcement action against noncompliant cras including through the issuance of public notices withdrawal of registration and in some cases the imposition of fines 

mis is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection in the eu applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations and restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed additional procedural and substantive requirements include conditions for the issuance of credit ratings rules regarding the organization of cras restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest pricing regulations and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments compliance with the eu regulations may increase our costs of operations and could have a significant negative effect on moody’s operations profitability or ability to compete or the markets for its products and services including in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict in addition exposure to increased liability under the eu regulations may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact moody’s results of operations 

 

 the eu and other jurisdictions engage in rulemaking on an ongoing basis that could significantly impact operations or the markets for moody’s products and services including regulations extending to products and services not currently regulated and regulations affecting the need for debt securities to be rated increasing the level of competition in the market for credit ratings establishing criteria for credit ratings or limiting the entities authorized to provide credit ratings moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations and the effect that they will have on moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant financial reforms in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company faces exposure to litigation and government regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to rating opinions and other business practices 

moody’s faces exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to mis’s ratings actions as well as other business practices and products if the market value of creditdependent instruments declines or defaults whether as a result of difficult economic times turbulent markets or otherwise the number of investigations and legal proceedings that moody’s faces could increase significantly parties who invest in securities rated by mis may pursue claims against mis or moody’s for losses they face in their portfolios we have faced numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation government investigations and inquiries concerning events linked to the us subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during the recent financial crisis legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues and any of these proceedings investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments damages fines penalties or activity restrictions risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the us in addition new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time furthermore to the extent that moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by moody’s increase substantially as does the risk of an adverse outcome see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the company currently faces due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought there is a risk that moody’s will be subject to judgments settlements fines penalties or other adverse results that could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to legal economic operational and regulatory risks of operating in multiple jurisdictions 

moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the company operates may have an impact on the company’s business for example economic uncertainty in the eurozone or elsewhere could affect the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas in addition operations abroad expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 additionally moody’s is subject to complex us foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the uk bribery act of 2010 and other antibribery and anticorruption laws although the company has implemented internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices such measures may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that the company has violated antibribery or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on moody’s reputation its ability to attract and retain employees its business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located including new york city the location of moody’s headquarters major cities worldwide in which moody’s has offices and locations in china used for certain moody’s analytics back office work this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure whether or not controlled by the company including the company’s electronic delivery systems data center facilities or the internet used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business many of the company’s products and services are delivered electronically and the company’s customers depend on the company’s ability to receive store process transmit and otherwise rapidly handle very substantial quantities of data and transactions on computerbased networks the company’s customers also depend on the continued capacity reliability and security of the company’s telecommunications data centers networks and other electronic delivery systems including its websites and connections to the internet the company’s employees also depend on these systems for internal use any significant failure compromise cyberbreach or interruption of the company’s infrastructure whether due to human error hardware failure or defect natural disasters fire power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political unrest war or otherwise may impair the company’s ability to deliver its products and services 

moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful the company relies on thirdparty providers to provide certain essential services while the company believes that such providers are reliable the company has limited control over the performance of such providers to the extent any of the company’s thirdparty providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fails to adequately expand its services to meet the company’s needs and the needs of the company’s customers the company could experience lower revenues and higher costs additionally although the company maintains processes to prevent detect and recover from a disruption the company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations such persons’ ability to service and interact with moody’s clients and customers may suffer the company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the company’s failure or the failure of a third party to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions a disruption to moody’s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its reputation business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its clients and employees in the company’s computer systems and networks and in those of its third party vendors the cyber risks the company faces range from cyberattacks common to most industries to more advanced threats that target the company because of its prominence in the global marketplace or due to its ratings of sovereign debt breaches of moody’s or moody’s vendors’ technology and systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data material interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s or such vendors’ web sites applications data processing or disruption of other business operations or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the company including information about moody’s business employees or customers as well as sensitive personally identifiable 

 

 information “pii” the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft measures that moody’s takes to avoid detect mitigate or recover from material incidents can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or may become ineffective recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers any material breaches of cybersecurity or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the company’s systems or those of the company’s third parties even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could cause the company to experience reputational harm loss of customers regulatory actions sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard the company’s clients’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results or financial condition 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the us and world financial markets furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional cras such as mis a majority of moody’s creditratingbased revenue is transactionbased and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings potential changes to us tax laws and policy could negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued in the us conditions that reduce issuers’ ability or willingness to issue debt securities such as market volatility declining growth currency devaluations or other adverse economic trends reduce the number and dollarequivalent volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees moody’s earns in its ratings business 

economic and government factors such as a longterm continuation of difficult economic conditions and a worsening of the sovereign debt crisis in europe may have an adverse impact on the company’s business future debt issuances also could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates widening credit spreads regulatory and political developments growth in the use of alternative sources of credit and defaults by significant issuers declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient and cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term due in part to rent technology compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further costreduction initiatives including those undertaken to date could make it difficult for the company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings volatility in the financial markets including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition which the company may not be able to successfully offset with cost reductions 

the company faces increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

there is price competition in the credit rating research credit risk management markets research and analytical services and financial training and certification services moody’s faces competition globally from other cras and from investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions in research as well as from inhouse research operations competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services as well as increased competition from nonnrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors at the same time a challenging business environment and consolidation among customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and reduce the company’s customer base weak economic growth is also intensifying competitive pricing pressures and can result in customers’ use of free or lowercost information that is available from alternative sources while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services it may lose market share if its pricing is not sufficiently competitive in addition the reform act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies the formation of additional nrsros may increase pricing and competitive pressures furthermore in some of the countries in which moody’s operates governments may provide financial or other support to local rating agencies any inability of moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to reputation and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be significantly impacted factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities the timing and nature of changes in rat

 

 ings a major compliance failure negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings regulators and legislative bodies including as to the ratings process and its implementation with respect to one or more securities and intentional or unintentional misrepresentations of moody’s products and services in advertising materials public relations information social media or other external communications operational errors whether by moody’s or a moody’s competitor could also harm the reputation of the company or the credit rating industry damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

the markets for credit ratings research credit risk management services research and analytical services and financial training and certification services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving regulatory requirements industry standards and market preferences the ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share moody’s competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources brand recognition market experience and technological expertise and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may position price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by moody’s moody’s also competes indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and services and its growth prospects further the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive internet information may reduce the demand for moody’s products and services for example in december 2016 the esma launched a database providing access to free current information on certain credit ratings and rating outlooks moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors any inability of moody to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company has a significant amount of intangible assets 

at december 31 2016 moody’s had 10236 million of goodwill and 2964 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet approximately 73 of these intangibles reside in the ma business and are allocated to the four reporting units within ma rda ers financial services training and certifications and moody’s analytics knowledge services the remaining 27 of these intangibles reside in mis and primarily relate to icra failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in an asset impairment charge which would result in a noncash charge to operating expenses goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be especially difficult in periods of market or economic uncertainty and turmoil and requires significant management estimates and judgment in addition the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty an asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures may negatively impact the company 

moody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing industries as greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies in the future moody’s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that could adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis there is a risk that even if the company invests significant resources in attempting to attract train and retain qualified personnel it will not succeed in its efforts and its business could be harmed 

moody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of raymond w mcdaniel jr the president and chief executive officer and other senior officers and key employees the loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

 

 moody’s acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results 

moody’s has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions dispositions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen its business and grow the company such transactions present significant challenges and risks the market for acquisition targets dispositions and other strategic transactions is highly competitive especially in light of industry consolidation which may affect moody’s ability to complete such transactions if moody’s is unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise its business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

if such transactions are completed the anticipated growth synergies and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations technologies and new employees the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the company prior to closing a transaction unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures scrutiny from competition and antitrust authorities failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business diverting management’s focus from other business operations and failing to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls procedures and policies the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected as a result the failure of acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s compliance and risk management programs may not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

moody’s operates in a number of countries and as a result the company is required to comply with numerous international and us federal state and local laws and regulations the company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations including anticorruption laws is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel moody’s policies and procedures to identify evaluate and manage the company’s risks may not be fully effective and moody’s employees or agents may engage in misconduct fraud or other errors it is not always possible to deter such errors and the precautions the company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases if moody’s employees violate its policies or if the company’s risk management methods are not effective the company could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of the company’s employees fines penalties regulatory sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or other penalties and may suffer harm to its reputation financial condition and operating results 

legal protections for the company’s intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or available to protect the company’s competitive advantages 

moody’s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary failure to protect the company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the company’s ability to compete effectively businesses the company acquires also involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges the company faces in protecting its strategic advantage in addition the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets on january 6 2015 a rule with direct relevance to the cra industry was published in the official journal of the european union regarding the types of information that cras are to provide about certain ratings those that were paid for by issuers for publication on a central website administered by esma the european ratings platform this rule directly relates to the company’s intellectual property as it requires that the company provide proprietary information at no cost that the company currently sells which could result in lost revenue esma launched the european rating platform for public use on december 1 2016 

unauthorized third parties may also try to obtain and use technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary it is also possible that moody’s competitors or other entities could obtain patents related to the types of products and services that moody’s offers and attempt to require moody’s to stop developing or marketing the products or services to modify or redesign the products or services to avoid infringing or to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services even if moody’s attempts to assert or protect its intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful these risks and the cost time and resources needed to address them may increase as the company’s business grows and its profile rises in countries with intellectual property regimes that are less protective than the rules and regulations applied in the united states 

the company is dependent on the use of thirdparty software data hosted solutions data centers and network infrastructure  together “third party technology”   and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or service offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

moody’s relies on third party technology in connection with its product development and offerings the company depends on the ability of third party technology providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products 

 

 on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the third party technology moody’s uses may become obsolete incompatible with future versions of the company’s products unavailable or fail to operate effectively and moody’s business could be adversely affected if the company is unable to timely or effectively replace such third party technology the company also monitors its use of third party technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements despite the company’s efforts the company cannot ensure that such third parties will permit moody’s use in the future resulting in increased third party technology acquisition costs and loss of rights in addition the company’s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for third party technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to third party technology are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also moody’s competitors increasing the risks noted above if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in tax rates or tax rules could affect future results 

as a global company moody’s is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries and jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities moody’s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where we face higher tax rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit or changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in the tax accounting and other laws treaties regulations policies and administrative practices or changes to their interpretation or enforcement including changes applicable to multinational corporations such as the base erosion profit shifting project being conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european union’s state aid rulings could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition in addition moody’s is subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and we have experienced increased scrutiny as business has grown moody’s regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes however developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect us although we believe our tax estimates and accruals are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 22 billion at december 31 2016 consisted of approximately 17 billion located outside of the us except as required under us tax laws moody’s does not provide for us taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely in our foreign operations if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we may be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate could be adversely affected

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moody’s corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

this mda contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” commencing on page 55 and item 1a “risk factors” commencing on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties risks and other factors associated with these statements 

the company 

moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings ii credit capital markets and economic related research data and analytical tools iii software solutions and related risk management services iv quantitative credit risk measures financial services training and certification services and v research and analytical services moody’s has two reportable segments mis and ma 

mis the credit rating agency publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors additionally mis earns revenue from certain nonratingsrelated operations which consist primarily of the distribution of research and financial instruments pricing services in the asiapacific region as well as revenue from icra’s nonratings revenue the revenue from these operations is included in the mis other lob and is not material to the results of the mis segment 

the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets within its rda business ma distributes research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies and commentary on topical creditrelated events the rda business also produces economic research as well as data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores within its ers business ma provides software solutions as well as related risk management services the ps business provides research and analytical services and financial training and certification programs 

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets pension and other retirement benefits utbs and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable 

pursuant to asc topic 605 when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available third party evidence if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 

the company’s products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under asc topic 605 the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control in instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit 

 

 the company determines whether its selling price in a multielement transaction meets the vsoe criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately the price established by management having the relevant authority to establish such a price in instances where the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range or only having a limited sales history the company attempts to establish tpe for deliverables the company determines whether tpe exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers however due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing possible differences in its market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the company may contain a significant level of differentiation andor customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained the company generally is unable to reliably determine tpe based on the selling price hierarchy established by asc topic 605 when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe the company will establish an esp esp is the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis the company establishes its best estimate of esp considering internal factors relevant to is pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives standalone sales prices of similar products percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service and customer segment and geography additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend the company reviews its determination of vsoe tpe and esp on an annual basis or more frequently as needed 

in the mis segment revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed generally one year in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities structured credit international residential mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities which was approximately 25 years on a weighted average basis at december 31 2016 at december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately 133 million 121 million and 107 million 

multiple element revenue arrangements in the mis segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees the company generally uses esp in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for initial ratings 

mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 accounts receivable included approximately 25 million 24 million and 22 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings furthermore for certain annual monitoring services fees are not invoiced until the end of the annual monitoring period and revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period at december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 accounts receivable included approximately 1591 million 1464 million and 1278 million respectively relating to accrued monitoring service revenue 

in the ma segment products and services offered by the company include software licenses and related maintenance subscriptions and professional services revenue from subscription based products such as research and data subscriptions and certain softwarebased credit risk management subscription products is recognized ratably over the related subscription period which is principally one year revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are performed a large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of november december and january 

products and services offered within the ma segment are sold either standalone or together in various combinations in instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and nonsoftware deliverables revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above 

if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using vsoe in the instances where the company is not able to determine vsoe for all of the deliverables of an arrangement the company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its vsoe and the 

 

 residual revenue to the delivered elements if the company is unable to determine vsoe for an undelivered element the company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the company has delivered all of the elements or when vsoe has been determined for the undelivered elements in cases where software implementation services are considered essential and vsoe of fair value exists for postcontract customer support “pcs” once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software license and service revenue is recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as implementation services are performed while pcs is recognized over the coverage period if vsoe of fair value does not exist for pcs once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin basis until essential services are complete at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining pcs coverage period if vsoe does not exist for pcs at the beginning of an arrangement but is established during implementation revenue not recognized due to the absence of vsoe will be recognized on a cumulative basis 

accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue based on historical experience and current conditions such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account writeoffs are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and invoice adjustment experience as well as the current aging status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the company’s consolidated results of operations 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities 

for claims litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range in other instances where a loss is reasonably possible management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation regulatory governmental investigations and inquiries enforcement and similar matters and contingencies particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also cannot predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition however in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time 

the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary insures the company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation employment practices litigation employee medical claims and terrorism for which the claims are not material to the company in addition for claim years 2008 and 2009 the insurance subsidiary insured the company for defense costs related to professional liability claims for matters insured by the company’s insurance subsidiary moody’s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion the company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management’s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as 

 

 well as actuarially determined estimates defense costs for matters not selfinsured by the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided 

for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic 740 of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

on july 31 of each year moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 

the company has six primary reporting units two within the company’s ratings business one for the icra business and one that encompasses all of moody’s other ratings operations and four reporting units within ma rda ers fstc and maks the rda reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools the ers reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions and also provides advanced actuarial software for the life insurance industry these products and services are primarily delivered via software that is licensed on a perpetual basis or sold on a subscription basis the fstc reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and implementation services the maks reporting unit formerly known as copal amba provides research and analytical services copal amba was renamed moody’s analytics knowledge services in december 2016 

the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a threestep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level in the first step the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount if a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist the company is not required to perform further testing if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more 

likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company must perform a third step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach the company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years at july 31 2016 the company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on all reporting units which resulted in no impairment of goodwill 

in january 2017 there was a management change in the maks business as of the date of the filing of this form 10k a new operating and strategic plan for this reporting unit under the new management structure has not yet been completed based on all available information the company does not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the maks reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount at december 31 2016 a quantitative impairment assessment for the maks reporting unit will be performed in the first quarter of 2017 upon the completion of revised financial projections under the new management structure which could result in a reduced fair value as compared to the july 31 2016 fair value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and appropriate comparable market metrics however as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from these estimates in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units

the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december 31 2016 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of july 31 2016 which was the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units 

 

 methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining of the fair value of reporting units 

the following is a discussion regarding the company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units excluding icra as of july 31 2016 the date of each reporting unit’s last quantitative assessment as icra is a publicly traded company in india the company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization 

the fair value of each reporting unit excluding icra was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples the dcf analysis requires significant estimates including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that is based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition 

the sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions described below are as of july 31 2016 the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology that requires significant management judgment 

 

  

 amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no such events or changes during 2016 that would indicate that the carrying amount of 

 

 amortizable intangible assets in any of the company’s reporting units may not be recoverable this determination was made based on continued growth consistent with operating and strategic plans for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides 

pension and other retirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these significant assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

 the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31 2016 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with thirdparty actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s retirement plans additionally the company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released mortality improvement scale mp2016 to accompany the rp2014 mortality tables to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the society of actuaries 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise excluding differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets the company amortizes as a component of annual pension expense total outstanding gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets for moody’s retirement plans the total actuarial losses as of december 31 2016 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 1303 million and moody’s expects to recognize a net periodic expense of 98 million in 2017 related to the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded us pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under asc topic 715 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2016 the company has an unrecognized asset loss of 77 million of which 15 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2018 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2017 operating income these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2017 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s retirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  

 a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2017 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be 349 million in 2017 or flat compared to the 343 million recognized in 2016 

stockbased compensation 

the company records compensation expense for all sharebased payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant this includes stock options and restricted stock the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the 

 

 company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 

an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2016 dollars in millions 

 

 income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utbs the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

for utbs asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utbs and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

for certain of its nonus subsidiaries the company has deemed the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations accordingly the company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings it is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated dividend distributions from nonus subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s 

reportable segments 

the company is organized into two reportable segments at december 31 2016 mis and ma 

the mis segment is comprised primarily of all of the company’s ratings operations the mis segment consists of five lines of business – cfg sfg fig ppif and mis other the ratings lobs generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide the mis other lob consists of certain nonratings operations managed by mis which consists of nonrating revenue from icra as well as certain research and financial instruments pricing service operations in the asiapacific region 

 

 the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets the ma segment consists of three lines of business – rda ers and ps 

the following is a discussion of the results of operations of the company and its reportable segments total mis revenue and total ma expenses include the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content data and products developed by mis the royalty rate charged by mis approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content data and products developed by mis total ma revenue and total mis expenses include intersegment fees charged to mis from ma for the use of certain ma products and services in mis’s ratings process these fees charged by ma are generally equal to the costs incurred by ma to provide these products and services overhead charges and corporate expenses which exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment additionally overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company which benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a revenuesplit methodology accordingly a reportable segment’s share of these costs will increase as its proportion of revenue relative to moody’s total revenue increases overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy information technology and support staff such as finance human resources and information technology

foreign exchange risk 

moody’s maintains a presence in 35 countries outside the us in 2016 approximately 36 and 27 of both the company’s revenue and expenses respectively were denominated in functional currencies other than the us dollar principally in the british pound and the euro as such the company is exposed to market risk from changes in fx rates as of december 31 2016 approximately 62 of moody’s assets were located outside the us making the company susceptible to fluctuations in fx rates the effects of translating assets and liabilities of nonus operations with nonus functional currencies to the us dollar are charged or credited to aoci in the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity deficit 

the effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency are charged to other nonoperating income expense net in the company’s consolidated statements of operations accordingly the company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency if the british pound were to weaken 10 relative to the euro there would be an approximate 3 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts additionally if the singapore dollar were to devalue 10 compared to the euro there would be an approximate 3 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts the change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by fx revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency additional information on the company’s forward contracts can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k 

additionally the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure related to nonus dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates if there is any ineffectiveness in the net investment hedges any change in the fair value of these hedges allocated to the ineffectiveness would be recognized immediately in other nonoperating expense income in the company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2016 all gains and losses on these derivatives designated as net investment hedges were recognized in oci if the british pound were to appreciate 10 compared to the euro there would be an approximate 3 million favorable impact to the foreign currency forward des

also the company has designated € 400 million of the 2015 senior notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate fx exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries if the euro were to strengthen 10 relative to the us dollar there would be an approximate 42 million unfavorable adjustment to oci this adjustment would be offset by favorable translation adjustments on the company’s euro net investment in subsidiaries 

in conjunction with the designation of a portion of the 2015 senior notes as a net investment hedge the company entered into a crosscurrency swap exchanging € 100 million for us dollars to mitigate fx exposure on the remaining principal balance of the 2015 senior notes not designated as a net investment hedge if the euro were to weaken 10 relative to the us dollar there would be an approximate 13 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the crosscurrency swap which would be partially offset by favorable revaluation gains on the € 100 million of the 2015 senior notes which were not designated as a net investment hedge

credit and interest rate risk 

the company’s interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates the company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed rate of interest on certain of its borrowings to a floating rate based on the 3month libor these swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing while net interest payments are recorded as interest expenseincome in the company’s consolidated statement of operations a hypothetical change of 100bps in the liborbased swap rate would result in an approximate 37 million change to the fair value of these interest rate swaps 

additional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k 

moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in highquality investmentgrade securities within and outside the us with maturities of three months or less when purchased the company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds money market deposit accounts certificates of deposit and issuers of highgrade commercial paper and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer shortterm investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit

mis publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide including various corporate and governmental obligations structured finance securities and commercial paper programs ratings revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to investors mis provides ratings in more than 120 countries ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media including the internet and realtime information systems widely used by securities traders and investors as of december 31 2015 mis had ratings relationships with approximately 11000 corporate issuers and approximately 20000 public finance issuers additionally the company has rated and currently monitors ratings on approximately 68000 structured finance obligations representing approximately 12000 transactions the aforementioned amounts relating to the number of issuers and transactions represent issuers or transactions that had an active rating at any point during the year ended december 31 2015 additionally mis earns revenue from certain nonratingsrelated operations which consist primarily of the distribution of research and financial instruments pricing services in the asiapacific region as well as revenue from icra’s nonratings operations the revenue from these operations is included in the mis other lob and is not material to the results of the mis segment 

the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets within its research data and analytics business ma distributes research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies commentary on topical credit related events and also provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores within its enterprise risk solutions business ma provides software solutions as well as related risk management services within its professional services business it provides outsourced research and analytical services along with financial training and certification programs ma customers represent more than 4700 institutions worldwide operating in approximately 140 countries during 2015 moody’s research website was accessed by over 259000 individuals including 34000 client users 

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and the types of securities or other obligations outstanding beginning in mid2007 there was a severe market disruption and associated financial crisis both in the developed and emerging markets resulting in a global decline in issuance activity for some significant asset classes and weak economic performance in advanced economies since this financial crisis many markets and economies have recovered and moody’s believes that the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixedincome market and related financial information market which includes information such as credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

 

 moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 moody’s is well positioned to benefit from a continued growth in global fixedincome market activity and a more informed use of credit ratings as well as research and related analytical products in an environment with heightened attention to credit risk analysis and management moody’s expects that these developments will support continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

strong secular trends should continue to provide longterm growth opportunities moody’s key growth drivers include debt market issuance driven by global gdp growth continued disintermediation of fixedincome markets in both developed and emerging economies that drives issuance and demand for new products and services growth in ma driven by further penetration into ma’s client base and expansion of bank and insurance risk regulatory requirements pricing opportunities aligned with value and advances in information technology 

growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates business investment spending corporate refinancing needs merger and acquisition activity issuer profits consumer borrowing levels and securitization activity rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the dollarequivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets mis’s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decisions however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank deposit ratings insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings and other areas partially mitigate mis’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixedincome markets furthermore the strong growth seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid1990’s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010 before stabilizing in 2011 with moody’s experiencing revenue growth in this market beginning in 2012 despite significant declines from peak market issuance levels moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global fixedincome markets and provide opportunities for longer term revenue growth 

the pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell which in the absence of the appropriate technology may not be readily or easily obtainable this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of established and newer capital markets as technology provides broader access to worldwide markets it also results in a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk data analytics and related services additionally information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support moody’s continued expansion in developing markets 

an ongoing trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets moody’s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems and that the trend of increased disintermediation will continue further disintermediation has continued because of the ongoing low interest rate environment and bank deleveraging which has encouraged a number of corporations and other entities to seek alternative funding in the bond markets 

moody’s also observes disintermediation in key emerging markets where economic growth may outpace internal banking system capacity thus disintermediation is expected to continue over the longerterm with moody’s targeting investment and resources to those markets where disintermediation and bond issuance is expected to remain robust 

 

 in response to the credit market disruptions beginning in mid2007 ongoing volatility in the global capital markets and new regulatory requirements financial institutions are investing in people processes and systems to enhance risk management and compliance functions regulations such as the financial reform act basel ii basel iii solvency ii and others may stimulate demand for ma products financial institutions are also investing in advanced qualitative and quantitative tools and services to support their management of complex balance sheets and diverse portfolios as well as operating costs ma offers a suite of risk management products and services to address these needs including but not limited to risk management software economic analysis training and professional services 

legislative bodies and regulators in the us europe and other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of cras which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of mis removal of references to ratings in certain regulations or increased costs of doing business for mis therefore in order to broaden the potential for expansion of nonratings services moody’s reorganized in january 2008 into two distinct businesses mis consisting primarily of the ratings business and ma which conducts activities including the sale of credit research produced by mis and the production and sale of other economic and creditrelated products and services the reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by ma into activities that may have otherwise been restricted for mis due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities 

moody’s operations are subject to various risks as more fully described in part i item 1a “risk factors” inherent in conducting business on a global basis such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions 

competition 

mis competes with other cras and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research many users of mis’s ratings also have inhouse credit research capabilities mis’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s ratings services sp a division of mcgraw hill financial there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp while in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp mis’s competitors include fitch ratings dominion bond rating service am best company japan credit rating agency ltd kroll bond rating agency inc morningstar inc and eganjones ratings company in europe there are approximately 30 companies currently registered with esma which include both purely domestic european cras and international cras such as sp fitch and dbrs there are additional competitors in other regions and countries for example in china where moody’s participates through a joint venture these competitors include china lianhe credit rating co ltd shanghai brilliance credit rating  investors service co ltd dagong global credit rating co ltd and pengyuan credit rating co ltd 

ma competes broadly in the financial information industry against diversified competitors such as thomson reuters bloomberg sp capital iq fitch solutions dun  bradstreet ibm wolters kluwer sungard sas fiserv msci and markit group among others ma’s main competitors within rda include sp capital iq creditsights thomson reuters intex ihs global insight blackrock solutions factset and other providers of fixed income analytics valuations economic data and research in ers ma faces competition from both large software providers such as ibm algorithmics sungard sas oracle misys oliver wyman verisk and various other vendors and inhouse solutions within professional services ma competes with omega performance dc gardner and a host of financial training and education firms and with evalueserve crisil global research  analytics and other providers of outsourced research and professional services respectively 

moody’s strategy 

moody’s corporate strategy is to be the world’s most respected authority serving financial risksensitive markets the key aspects to implement this strategy are to 

 

  

  

  

 moody’s will make investments to defend and enhance its core businesses in an attempt to position the company to fully capture market opportunities resulting from global debt capital market expansion and increased business investment spending moody’s will also make strategic investments to achieve scale in attractive financial information markets move into attractive product and service adjacencies where the company can leverage its brand extend its thought leadership and expand its geographic presence in high growth emerging markets 

to broaden the company’s potential ma provides a wide range of products and services to enable financial institutions to better manage risk as such ma adds to the company’s value proposition in three ways first ma’s subscription businesses provide a significant base of recurring revenue to offset cyclicality in ratings issuance volumes that may result in volatility to mis’s revenues second ma products and services such as financial training and professional services on research and risk management best practices provide opportunities for entry into emerging markets before debt capital markets fully develop and thus present longterm growth opportunities for the ratings business finally ma’s integrated risk management software platform embeds moody’s solutions deep into the technology infrastructure of banks and insurance companies worldwide 

moody’s invests in initiatives to implement the company’s strategy including internallyled organic development and targeted acquisitions example initiatives include 

 

  

  

  

  

 during 2015 moody’s continued to acquire complementary businesses in mis and ma in may 2015 moody’s acquired equilibrium a leading provider of credit rating and research services in peru and other countries in latin america in december 2015 moody’s acquired the residential mortgage backed securities rmbs data and analytics assets of blackbox logic moody’s will integrate blackbox logic’s loanlevel rmbs data and technologies into products of its structured analytics and valuations unit within the rda lob in ma 

regulation 

mis and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the us and in other countries including by state and local authorities thus existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company’s operations and the markets for securities that it rates additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered each of the existing adopted proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which moody’s operates 

the regulatory landscape has changed rapidly in recent years and continues to evolve in the eu the cra industry is registered and supervised through a paneuropean regulatory framework the european securities and markets authority has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered cra industry throughout the eu mis is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed reporting requirements to esma regarding fees and additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services 

separately cra3 also requires that esma and  or the european commission produce several reports on the industry’s structure and the use of ratings in october 2015 esma published its reports wherein it acknowledged the impact of regulation on the industry and stated that it will continue to monitor the industry structure over the next three to five years the european commission is expected to publish its reports during the first half of 2016 

in the us cras are subject to extensive regulation primarily pursuant to the reform act and the financial reform act the sec is required by these legislative acts to publish two annual reports to congress on nrsros the financial reform act requires the sec to examine each nrsro once a year and issue an annual report summarizing the examination findings among other requirements the annual report required by the reform act details the sec’s views on the state of competition transparency and conflicts of interests among nrsros among other requirements the sec voted in august 2014 to adopt its final rules for nrsros as required by the financial reform act the company has made and continues to make substantial it and other investments and has implemented the relevant compliance obligations 

 

 in light of the regulations that have gone into effect in both the eu and the us as well as many other countries from time to time and as a matter of course pursuant to their enabling legislation these regulatory authorities have and will continue to publish reports that describe their oversight activities over the industry in addition other legislation andor interpretation of existing regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future finally in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which mis operates the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of the company cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

 item 1a   risk factors tableend the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occur moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on form 10k 

us laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry are rapidly evolving and may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us including the reform act and the financial reform act these regulations are complex continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time see “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information these laws and regulations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these laws and regulations and any future rulemaking or court rulings could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs which moody’s may be unable to pass through to customers in addition there may be uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations the company may be required to incur significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines penalties or other sanctions legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on moody’s business and its customers’ businesses for example new laws and regulations may affect mis’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which mis’s ratings are developed assigned and communicated affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate impact the demand for mis’s ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business including by restricting or mandating business models for rating agencies further speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect moody’s stock price although these recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally they may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on moody’s operations profitability and competitiveness the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized 

financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

in addition to the extensive and evolving us laws and regulations governing the industry foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings in particular the eu has adopted a new regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the eu and introduced a common eu regulatory approach to oversight of cras the eu has established conditions for the issuance of credit ratings rules on the organization and conduct of cras—including restrictions on certain activities deemed to create a conflict of interest—and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments esma has direct supervisory authority for cras in the eu 

mis is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed and additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services 

 

 eu financial reforms could have a significant negative effect on moody’s operations profitability or ability to compete or the markets for its products and services including in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict in particular exposure to increased liability under the eu regulations may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact moody’s results of operations in addition compliance with the amended eu regulations may increase costs of operations 

the eu and other jurisdictions are engaged in ongoing rulemaking that could significantly impact operations or the markets for moody’s products and services including regulations affecting the need for debt securities to be rated establishing criteria for credit ratings or limiting the entities authorized to provide credit ratings in january 2015 two additional rules generally referred to as “regulatory technical standards” or “rtss” of direct relevance to the cra industry were published in the official journal of the european union i cras’ reporting requirements to esma on their fees and ii the types of information that cras are to provide about certain ratings those that were paid for by issuers for publication on a central website administered by esma the european ratings platform separately cra3 also requires that esma and  or the european commission produce several reports which have not yet been completed on the industry’s structure and the use of ratings moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations and the effect that they will have on moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant financial reforms in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company faces exposure to litigation and government regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries related to rating opinions and other business practices 

moody’s faces exposure to litigation related to mis’s ratings actions as well as other business practices and products if the market value of creditdependent instruments declines or defaults whether as a result of difficult economic times turbulent markets or otherwise the number of investigations and legal proceedings that moody’s faces could increase significantly parties who invest in securities rated by mis may pursue claims against mis or moody’s for losses they face in their portfolios we have faced numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation government investigations and inquiries concerning events linked to the us subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during the recent financial crisis legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues and any of these proceedings investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments damages fines penalties or activity restrictions risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the us in addition new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time furthermore to the extent that moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by moody’s increase substantially as does the risk of an adverse outcome see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the company currently faces due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought there is a risk that moody’s will be subject to judgments settlements fines penalties or other adverse results that could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to legal economic and regulatory risks of operating in multiple jurisdictions 

moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the company operates may have an impact on the company’s business for example economic uncertainty in the eurozone or elsewhere could affect the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas in addition operations abroad expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 additionally moody’s is subject to complex us and foreign laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the uk bribery act 2010 and other antibribery and anticorruption laws although the company has implemented internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices such measures may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that the company has violated antibribery or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on moody’s reputation its ability to attract and retain employees its business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located including new york city the location of moody’s headquarters major cities worldwide in which moody’s has offices and locations in china used for data and development work this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure including the company’s electronic delivery systems data center facilities and the internet used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business whether due to human error hardware failure natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political unrest war or otherwise moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful the company relies on thirdparty providers to provide certain essential services while the company believes that such providers are reliable the company has limited control over the performance of such providers to the extent any of the company’s thirdparty providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand its services to meet the company’s needs and the needs of the company’s customers the company could experience lower revenues and higher costs the company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations such persons’ ability to service and interact with moody’s clients and customers may suffer the company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the company’s failure or the failure of a third party to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions a disruption to moody’s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its reputation business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its clients in the company’s computer systems and networks and those of its third party vendors the cyber risks the company faces range from cyberattacks common to most industries to more advanced threats that target the company because of its prominence in the global marketplace or due to its ratings of sovereign debt breaches of moody’s or moody’s vendors’ technology and systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking computer viruses or malware employee error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data material interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s or such vendors’ web sites applications data processing or disruption of other business operations or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the company including information about moody’s business or customers as well as sensitive personally identifiable information “pii” the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft measures that moody’s takes to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or may become ineffective any material breaches of cybersecurity could cause the company to experience reputational harm loss of customers regulatory actions sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard the company’s clients’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results or financial condition 

 

 changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the us and world financial markets furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional cras such as mis a majority of moody’s creditratingbased revenue is transactionbased and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings conditions that reduce issuers’ ability or willingness to issue debt securities such as market volatility declining growth currency devaluations or other adverse economic trends reduce the number and dollarequivalent volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees we earn in our ratings business 

economic and government factors such as a longterm continuation of difficult economic conditions and a worsening of the sovereign debt crisis in europe may have an adverse impact on the company’s business future debt issuances also could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates widening credit spreads regulatory and political developments growth in the use of alternative sources of credit and defaults by significant issuers declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient and cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term due in part to rent technology compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further costreduction initiatives including those undertaken to date could make it difficult for the company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings volatility in the financial markets including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition which the company may not be able to successfully offset with cost reductions 

the company faces increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

there is price competition in the credit rating research credit risk management markets outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and certification services moody’s faces competition from other cras and from investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions in research as well as from inhouse research operations competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services as well as increased competition from nonnrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors at the same time a challenging business environment and consolidation among customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and reduce the company’s customer base weak economic growth is also intensifying competitive pricing pressures and can result in customers’ use of free or lowercost information that is available from alternative sources while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services it may lose market share if its pricing is not sufficiently competitive in addition the reform act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies the formation of additional nrsros may increase pricing and competitive pressures furthermore in some of the countries in which moody’s operates governments may provide financial or other support to local rating agencies any inability of moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to reputation and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be significantly impacted factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities the timing and nature of changes in ratings a major compliance failure negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings regulators and legislative bodies including as to the ratings process and its implementation with respect to one or more securities operational errors whether by moody’s or a moody’s competitor could also harm the reputation of the company or the credit rating industry damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

the markets for credit ratings research credit risk management services outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and certification services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards the ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share 

 

 moody’s competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources brand recognition market experience and technological expertise and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may position price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by moody’s moody’s also competes indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and services and its growth prospects further the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive internet information may reduce the demand for moody’s products and services moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors any inability of moody to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company has a significant amount of intangible assets 

at december 31 2015 moody’s had 9763 million of goodwill and 2991 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet approximately 70 of these intangibles reside in the ma business and are allocated to the four reporting units within ma rda ers financial services training and certifications and copal amba the remaining 30 of these intangibles reside in mis and primarily relate to icra failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in an asset impairment charge which would result in a noncash charge to operating expenses goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be especially difficult in periods of market or economic uncertainty and turmoil and requires significant management estimates and judgment in addition the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty an asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures may negatively impact the company 

moody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing industries as greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies in the future moody’s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that could adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis there is a risk that even if the company invests significant resources in attempting to attract train and retain qualified personnel it will not succeed in its efforts and its business could be harmed 

moody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of raymond w mcdaniel jr the president and chief executive officer and other senior officers and key employees the loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results 

moody’s has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen its business and grow the company such transactions present significant challenges and risks the market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive especially in light of industry consolidation which may affect moody’s ability to complete such transactions if moody’s is unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise its business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

if such transactions are completed the anticipated growth synergies and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations technologies and new employees the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the company prior to closing a transaction unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business diverting management’s focus from other business operations and failing to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls procedures and policies the 

 

 anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected as a result the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s compliance and risk management programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

moody’s operates in a number of countries and as a result the company is required to comply with numerous international and us federal state and local laws and regulations the company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations including anticorruption laws is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel moody’s policies and procedures to identify evaluate and manage the company’s risks may not be fully effective and moody’s employees or agents may engage in misconduct fraud or other errors it is not always possible to deter such errors and the precautions the company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases if moody’s employees violate its policies or if the company’s risk management methods are not effective the company could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer harm to the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

legal protections for the company’s intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or available to protect the company’s competitive advantages 

moody’s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary failure to protect the company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the company’s ability to compete effectively in addition the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets on january 6 2015 a rule with direct relevance to the cra industry was published in the official journal of the european union regarding the types of information that cras are to provide about certain ratings those that were paid for by issuers for publication on a central website administered by esma the european ratings platform this rule directly relates to the company’s intellectual property as it would require that the company provide proprietary information at no cost that the company currently sells which could result in lost revenue 

additionally despite the company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may try to obtain and use technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary it is also possible that moody’s competitors or other entities could obtain patents related to the types of products and services that moody’s offers and attempt to require moody’s to stop developing or marketing the products or services to modify or redesign the products or services to avoid infringing or to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services even if moody’s attempts to assert or protect its intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful 

the company is dependent on the use of thirdparty software data hosted solutions data centers and network infrastructure  together “third party technology”   and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or service offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

moody’s relies on third party technology in connection with its product development and offerings the company depends on the ability of third party technology providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the third party technology moody’s uses may become obsolete incompatible with future versions of the company’s products unavailable or fail to operate effectively and moody’s business could be adversely affected if the company is unable to timely or effectively replace such third party technology the company also monitors its use of third party technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements despite the company’s efforts the company cannot assure that such third parties will permit moody’s use in the future resulting in increased third party technology acquisition costs and loss of rights in addition the company’s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for third party technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to third party technology are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also moody’s competitors increasing the risks noted above if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in tax rates or tax rules could affect future results 

as a global company moody’s is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries and jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities moody’s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where we face higher tax rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit or changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in the tax accounting and other laws treaties regulations policies and administrative practices or changes to their interpretation or enforcement including changes applicable to multinational corporations such as the base erosion profit shifting project being conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european union’s 

 

 state aid rulings could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition in addition moody’s is subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and we have experienced increased scrutiny as business has grown moody’s regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes however developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect us although we believe our tax estimates and accruals are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 22 billion at december 31 2015 consisted of approximately 15 billion located outside of the us except as required under us tax laws moody’s does not provide for us taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely in our foreign operations if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate could be adversely affected

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moody’s corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

this mda contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” commencing on page 56 and item 1a “risk factors” commencing on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties risks and other factors associated with these statements 

the company 

moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings ii credit capital markets and economic related research data and analytical tools iii software solutions and related risk management services iv quantitative credit risk measures financial services training and certification services and v outsourced research and analytical services moody’s has two reportable segments mis and ma 

mis the credit rating agency publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors additionally mis earns revenue from certain nonratingsrelated operations which consist primarily of the distribution of research and financial instruments pricing services in the asiapacific region as well as revenue from icra’s nonratings operations the revenue from these operations is included in the mis other lob and is not material to the results of the mis segment 

the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets within its rda business ma distributes research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies and commentary on topical creditrelated events the rda business also produces economic research as well as data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores within its ers business ma provides software solutions as well as related risk management services the ps business provides outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and certification programs 

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets pension and other retirement benefits utps and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable 

pursuant to the guidance of asc topic 605 when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available third party evidence if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 

the company’s products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under asc topic 605 the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control in instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met the delivered item is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit 

the company determines whether its selling price in a multielement transaction meets the vsoe criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately the price established by management having 

 

 the relevant authority to establish such a price in instances where the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range or only having a limited sales history the company attempts to establish tpe for deliverables the company determines whether tpe exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers however due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing possible differences in the company’s market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the company may contain a significant level of differentiation andor customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained the company generally is unable to reliably determine tpe based on the selling price hierarchy established by asu 200913 when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe the company will establish an esp esp is the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis the company establishes its best estimate of esp considering internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives standalone sales prices of similar products percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service and customer segment and geography additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend the company reviews its determination of vsoe tpe and esp on an annual basis or more frequently as needed 

in the mis segment revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed generally one year in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities structured credit international residential mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities issuers can elect to pay all future monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities which was approximately 27 years on a weighted average basis at december 31 2015 at december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately 121 million 107 million and 97 million respectively 

multiple element revenue arrangements in the mis segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees the company generally uses esp in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for initial ratings 

mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 accounts receivable included approximately 24 million 22 million and 21 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings furthermore for certain annual monitoring services fees are not invoiced until the end of the monitoring period however revenue is recognized ratably over the monitoring period at december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 accounts receivable included approximately 1464 million 1278 million and 967 million respectively relating to accrued monitoring service revenue 

in the ma segment products and services offered by the company include software licenses and related maintenance subscriptions and professional services revenue from subscription based products such as research and data subscriptions and certain softwarebased credit risk management subscription products is recognized ratably over the related subscription period which is principally one year revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are performed if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs a large portion of annual research and data subscriptions as well as annual software maintenance is invoiced in november december and january of each year 

products and services offered within the ma segment are sold either standalone or together in various combinations in instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and nonsoftware deliverables revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition previously described 

if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using vsoe in the instances where the company is not able to determine vsoe for all of the deliverables of an arrangement the company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its vsoe and the residual revenue to the delivered elements if the company is unable to determine vsoe for an undelivered element the company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the company has delivered all of the elements or when vsoe has been determined for the undelivered elements in cases where software implementation services are considered essential and vsoe of fair 

 

 value exists for postcontract customer support “pcs” once the delivery criteria have been met on the standard software license and service revenue is recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as implementation services are performed while pcs is recognized over the coverage period if vsoe of fair value does not exist for pcs once the delivery criteria have been met on the standard software service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin basis until essential services are complete at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining pcs coverage period if vsoe does not exist for pcs at the beginning of an arrangement but is established during implementation revenue not recognized due to the absence of vsoe will be recognized on a cumulative basis 

accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue based on historical experience and current conditions such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account writeoffs are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the company’s consolidated results of operations 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities 

for claims litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range in other instances because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation regulatory governmental investigations and inquiries enforcement and similar matters and contingencies particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also cannot predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition however in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time 

the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary insures the company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation employment practices litigation employee medical claims and terrorism for which the claims are not material to the company in addition for claim years 2008 and 2009 the insurance subsidiary insured the company for defense costs related to professional liability claims for matters insured by the company’s insurance subsidiary moody’s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion the company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management’s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates defense costs for matters not selfinsured by the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided 

 

 for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic 740 of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

on july 31 of each year moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment

the company has six primary reporting units two within the company’s ratings business one for the icra business and one that encompasses all of moody’s other ratings operations and four reporting units within ma rda ers fstc and copal amba the rda reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools the ers reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions primarily delivered via software that is licensed or sold on a subscription basis the fstc reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and implementation services the copal amba reporting unit provides outsourced research and analytical services 

the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a threestep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level in the first step the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount if a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist the company is not required to perform further testing if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company must perform a third step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach the company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years at july 31 2013 the company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on all reporting units which resulted in no impairment of goodwill 

at july 31 2015 the company performed quantitative assessments of the rda ers fstc copal amba and icra reporting units and a qualitative assessment for the remaining reporting unit the quantitative assessments did not result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value the qualitative analysis resulted in the company determining that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying amount the most significant factors in the qualitative assessment were an assessment of actual to projected results and a comparison of projected results in the prior quantitative analysis compared to the reporting unit’s current year projection additionally the weighted average cost of capital wacc is assessed as well as the impact of various macroeconomic conditions and other factors that could impact future cash flows 

the company quantitatively tested the rda ers fstc copal amba and icra reporting units as of july 31 2015 due to the factors outlined below 

 

  

 determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and appropriate comparable market metrics however as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from these estimates in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 

sensitivity analyses and key assumptions for deriving the fair value of a reporting unit 

the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december 31 2015 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units for the rda ers fstc copal amba and icra reporting units the fair value was calculated as of july 31 2015 for the mis reporting unit the fair value was calculated as of july 31 2013 as there have been no qualitative factors that have resulted in the company deeming it necessary to perform a quantitative assessment subsequent to this date 

 

 methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining of the fair value of reporting units 

the following is a discussion regarding the company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units excluding icra as of the date of each reporting unit’s last quantitative test july 31 2015 for rda ers fstc and copal amba july 31 2013 for the mis reporting unit as icra is a publicly traded company in india the company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization 

the fair value of each reporting unit excluding icra was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples the dcf analysis requires significant estimates including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that is based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments 

the sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions described below are as of the date of last quantitative assessment for each reporting unit the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology that requires significant management judgment 

 

  

  amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no such events or changes during the year ended december 31 2015 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the company’s reporting units may not be recoverable this determination was made based on continued growth consistent with operating and strategic plans for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides additionally there were no events or circumstances during the year ended december 31 2015 that would indicate the need for an adjustment of the remaining useful lives of these amortizable intangible assets 

pension and other retirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these significant assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

 the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31 2015 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with thirdparty actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s retirement plans additionally the company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released rp2014 mortality tables and accompanying mortality improvement scale mp2015 to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the society of actuaries 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise excluding differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets the company amortizes as a component of annual pension expense total outstanding gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets for moody’s retirement plans the total actuarial losses as of december 31 2015 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 1385 million and moody’s expects to recognize a net periodic expense of 105 million in 2016 related to the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded us pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under asc topic 715 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2015 the company has an unrecognized asset loss of 105 million of which 07 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2017 expense 

 

 the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2016 operating income these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2016 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s retirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  

 based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be 355 million in 2016 compared with 408 million in 2015 the expected expense decrease in 2016 reflects the effects of lower benefit obligations primarily due to higher discount rate assumptions lower amortization of actuarial losses and a higher assumed long term rate of return on pension assets 

stockbased compensation 

the company records compensation expense for all sharebased payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant this includes stock options and restricted stock the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 

an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2015 dollars in millions 

 

 income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

for utps asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

for certain of its nonus subsidiaries the company has deemed the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations accordingly the company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely 

 

 reinvested earnings it is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated dividend distributions from nonus subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s 

reportable segments 

the company is organized into two reportable segments at december 31 2015 mis and ma 

the mis segment is comprised primarily of all of the company’s ratings operations the mis segment consists of five lines of business – cfg sfg fig ppif and mis other the ratings lobs generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide the mis other lob consists of certain nonratings operations managed by mis which consists of nonrating revenue from icra as well as certain research and financial instruments pricing service operations in the asiapacific region 

the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets the ma segment consists of three lines of business – rda ers and ps 

in december 2013 a subsidiary of the company acquired amba a provider of investment research and quantitative analytics for global financial institutions amba is part of the ma reportable segment and its revenue is included in the ps lob in june 2014 a subsidiary of the company acquired a controlling stake in icra a leading provider of credit ratings and research in india icra is part of the mis reportable segment and its ratings revenue is included in the respective ratings lobs of mis while its nonratings revenue is included in the mis other lob in july 2014 a subsidiary of the company acquired webequity a leading provider of cloudbased loan origination solutions for financial institutions webequity is part of the ma reporting segment and its revenue is included in the ers lob in october 2014 the company acquired lewtan a leading provider of analytical tools and data for the global structured finance market lewtan is part of the ma reportable segment and its revenue is included in the rda lob 

pursuant to the acquisition of icra the company realigned certain components of its reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2014 this realignment resulted in the creation of the mis other lob which now consists of nonratings revenue from icra as well as certain research and financial instruments pricing revenue in the asiapacific region which was previously reported in the rda lob of ma these businesses are all managed by mis and the expenses from these operations will be included in the mis reportable segment all prior period results for both mis and ma have been restated to reflect this realignment and the impact of the realignment was not significant to mis’s or ma’s previously reported results 

the following is a discussion of the results of operations of the company and its reportable segments total mis revenue and total ma expenses include the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content data and products developed by mis the royalty rate charged by mis approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content data and products developed by mis total ma revenue and total mis expenses include intersegment fees charged to mis from ma for the use of certain ma products and services in mis’s ratings process these fees charged by ma are generally equal to the costs incurred by ma to provide these products and services overhead charges and corporate expenses which exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment additionally overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company which benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a revenuesplit methodology accordingly a reportable segment’s share of these costs will increase as its proportion of revenue relative to moody’s total revenue increases overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy information technology and support staff such as finance human resources and information technology

 moody’s corporation 

 

  

 the table below shows moody’s global staffing by geographic area 

 

 global revenue of 34845 million in 2015 increased 1502 million or 5 compared to 2014 excluding the unfavorable impact from changes in fx translation rates global revenue increased 9 compared to prior year and reflected growth in both reportable segments transaction revenue accounted for 50 of global mco revenue in both 2015 and 2014 

the mis revenue increase reflected changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases primarily in the us coupled with growth in rated issuance volumes for investmentgrade corporate debt and higher us pfg refunding volumes the growth also reflects increases across all asset classes within sfg and higher banking revenue coupled with revenue from the icra acquisition these increases were partially offset by an approximate 102 million unfavorable impact due to changes in fx rates as well as declines in rated issuance volumes for highyield corporate debt and bank loans 

 

 the growth in ma reflects higher revenue in rda and ers partially offset by decreases in ps revenue the increase in rda was primarily driven by growth from sales of credit research and licensing of ratings data the growth in ers reflects increases in all product offerings with particular strength in the credit assessment and origination business the 2014 acquisitions of lewtan and webequity also contributed to growth in rda and ers respectively partially offsetting these increases in ma was an approximate 47 million unfavorable impact due to changes in fx translation rates 

us revenue of 20090 million in 2015 increased 1945 million over the prior year reflecting changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases within mis growth in rated issuance volumes for investmentgrade corporate debt higher pfg refunding volumes and revenue increases in most asset classes in sfg the growth also reflects increases across all ma lobs these increases were partially offset by declines in bank loan rated issuance compared to the prior year 

nonus revenue decreased 443 million from 2014 reflecting an approximate 146 million unfavorable impact from changes in fx translation rates coupled with declines in highyield corporate debt and bank loan issuance in emea as well as a revenue decline in ps these declines were partially offset by increases in rda and ers revenue in all regions within ma as well as growth across most asset classes within sfg in emea 

operating expenses were 9763 million in 2015 and increased 460 million from 2014 due to an approximate 33 million and 13 million increase in compensation and noncompensation costs respectively the increase in compensation costs reflected higher expenses resulting from the impact of annual compensation increases as well as higher headcount due to business growth and from acquisitions additionally higher pension costs contributed to the compensation expense growth reflecting a lower discount rate used to measure expense and the use of a new mortality table these increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation reflecting lower achievement against fullyear targeted results compared to the prior year the increase in noncompensation expenses reflected higher costs to support various it and other operational enhancement projects higher variable costs to support business growth and expenses from the icra webequity and lewtan acquisitions in the second half of 2014 the changes above include a favorable impact relating to changes in fx translation rates compared to the prior year 

sga expenses of 9213 million in 2015 increased 520 million compared to the prior year period reflecting higher compensation and noncompensation expenses of approximately 27 million and 25 million respectively the growth in compensation costs was primarily due to higher expenses resulting from annual compensation increases headcount growth in mis and ma as well as in overhead support areas coupled with higher headcount from acquisitions additionally higher pension costs contributed to the compensation expense growth reflecting a lower discount rate used to measure expense and the use of a new mortality table these increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation reflecting lower achievement against fullyear targeted results compared to the prior year the increase in noncompensation expenses reflects higher costs to support various it and other operational enhancement projects as well as higher rent and occupancy costs reflecting various real estate projects worldwide additionally the increase reflects noncompensation expenses from the icra webequity and lewtan acquisitions in the second half of 2014 the increases above include a favorable impact relating to changes in fx translation rates compared to the prior year 

da increased 179 million reflecting amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions as well as higher depreciation reflecting an increase in capital expenditures to support it infrastructure and business growth 

operating income of 14734 million increased 343 million from 2014 adjusted operating income was 15869 million in 2015 and increased 522 million compared to 2014 operating margin decreased 90 bps compared to 2014 adjusted operating margin in 2015 of 455 decreased 50 bps compared to the prior year the decrease in operating margin and adjusted operating margin is primarily due to continued investment in the company’s operations as well as the acquisition of companies that operate at a margin below moody’s historical margin and fx translation unfavorable changes in fx translation rates negatively impacted operating income and adjusted operating income by approximately 76 million and 79 million respectively 

interest income expense net in 2015 was 1151 million or flat compared to 2014 reflecting higher interest on borrowings due to the issuance of the 2014 senior notes 5year and 2014 senior notes 30year in july 2014 as well as the issuance of the 2015 senior notes and additional issuance under the 2014 senior notes 30year in 2015 these increases were offset by 11 million in net costs net of a gain on the termination of an interest rate swap related to the early repayment of the series 20051 notes in 2014 

other nonoperating income expense net was 213 million in 2015 a 146 million decrease in income compared to 2014 the decrease primarily reflects fx gains of 203 million in 2014 which was primarily due to strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro and british pound for certain us dollar denominated assets held in international jurisdictions the fx gains in 2015 were not significant 

the 1028 million icra gain related to a fair value remeasurement of the company’s previously held equity investment in icra which occurred in connection with moody’s acquiring a controlling stake in icra on june 26 2014 

 

 

 the company’s etr was 312 in 2015 or flat compared to 2014 the 2015 etr includes a benefit relating to a state tax ruling and a change in local tax law relating to income apportionment as well as the resolution of certain domestic and international tax matters the 2014 etr reflects a benefit from the favorable resolution of an international tax matter

the effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency are charged to other nonoperating income expense net in the company’s consolidated statements of operations accordingly the company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency if the euro were to weaken 10 relative us dollar there would be an approximate 7 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts if the british pound were to weaken 10 relative to the euro there would be an approximate 2 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts additionally if other foreign currencies in the company’s foreign exchange forward portfolio were to devalue 10 compared to the euro there would be an approximate 3 million favorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts the change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by fx revaluation gains or losses in future earnings on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency additional information on the company’s forward contracts can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k 

additionally the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure related to nonus dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates any change in the fair value of these hedges that is the result of ineffectiveness would be recognized immediately in other nonoperating expense income in the company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 all gains and losses on these derivatives designated as net investment hedges were recognized in oci if the japanese yen were to appreciate 10 compared to the us dollar there would be an approximate 18 million unfavorable impact to the foreign currency forward designated as a net investment hedge with a japanese yenus dollar currency pairing if the british pound were to appreciate 10 compared to the euro there would be an approximate 4 million unfavorable impact to the foreign currency forward designated as a net investment hedge with a british poundeuro currency pairing these adjustments would partially offset the currency translation adjustment component of aoci additional information on the company’s forward contracts designated as net investment hedges can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k

credit and interest rate risk 

the company’s interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives

 nongaap financial measures 

in addition to its reported results moody’s has included in this mda certain adjusted results that the sec defines as “nongaap financial measures” management believes that such nongaap financial measures when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the company’s performance facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking these nongaap measures as defined by the company are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies furthermore these nongaap measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other gaap measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the company below are brief descriptions of the company’s nongaap financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the nongaap measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure 

constant currency measures

 free cash flow 

the company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital additions management believes that free cash flow is a useful metric in assessing the company’s cash flows to service debt pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases management deems capital expenditures essential to the company’s product and service innovations and maintenance of moody’s operational capabilities accordingly capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of moody’s cash flow below is a reconciliation of the company’s net cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow

 item 1   business tableend background 

as used in this report except where the context indicates otherwise the terms “moody’s” or the “company” refer to moody’s corporation a delaware corporation and its subsidiaries the company’s executive offices are located at 7 world trade center at 250 greenwich street new york ny 10007 and its telephone number is 212 5530300

mis publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide including various corporate and governmental obligations structured finance securities and commercial paper programs ratings revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to investors mis provides ratings in more than 120 countries ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media including the internet and realtime information systems widely used by securities traders and investors as of december 31 2014 mis had ratings relationships with approximately 11000 corporate issuers and approximately 21000 public finance issuers additionally the company has rated and currently monitors ratings on approximately 72000 structured finance obligations representing approximately 12000 transactions the aforementioned amounts relating to the number of issuers and transactions represent issuers or transactions that had an active rating at any point during the year ended december 31 2014 additionally mis earns revenue from certain nonratingsrelated operations which consist primarily of the distribution of research and fixed income pricing services in the asiapacific region and from icra nonratings services the revenue from these operations is included in the mis other lob and is not material to the results of the mis segment 

the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets within its research data and analytics business ma distributes research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies commentary on topical credit related events and also provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores within its enterprise risk solutions business ma provides software solutions as well as related risk management services within its professional services business it provides outsourced research and analytical services along with financial training and certification programs ma customers represent more than 4700 institutions worldwide operating in approximately 130 countries during 2014 moody’s research web site was accessed by over 245000 individuals including 33000 client users 

the company operated as part of “old db” until september 30 2000 when old db separated into two publicly traded companies – moody’s corporation and new db at that time old db distributed to its shareholders shares of new db stock new db comprised the business of old db’s dun  bradstreet operating company the remaining business of old db consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services and was renamed moody’s corporation for purposes of governing certain ongoing relationships between the company and new db after the 2000 distribution the company and new db entered into various agreements including a distribution agreement tax allocation agreement and employee benefits agreement 

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and the types of securities or other obligations outstanding beginning in mid2007 there was a severe market disruption and associated financial crisis both in the 

 

 developed and emerging markets resulting in a global decline in issuance activity for some significant asset classes and weak economic performance in advanced economies since this financial crisis many markets and economies have recovered and moody’s believes that the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixedincome market and related financial information market which includes information such as credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 moody’s is well positioned to benefit from a continued growth in global fixedincome market activity and a more informed use of credit ratings as well as research and related analytical products in an environment with heightened attention to credit risk analysis and management moody’s expects that these developments will support continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

strong secular trends should continue to provide longterm growth opportunities moody’s key growth drivers include debt market issuance driven by global gdp growth continued disintermediation of fixedincome markets in both developed and emerging economies that drives issuance and demand for new products and services growth in ma driven by further penetration into ma’s client base and expansion of bank and insurance risk regulatory requirements pricing opportunities aligned with value and advances in information technology 

growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates business investment spending corporate refinancing needs merger and acquisition activity issuer profits consumer borrowing levels and securitization activity rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the dollarequivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets mis’s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decisions however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings and other areas partially mitigate mis’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixedincome markets furthermore the strong growth seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid1990’s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010 before stabilizing in 2011 with moody’s experiencing revenue growth in this market beginning in 2012 despite significant declines from peak market issuance levels moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global fixedincome markets and provide opportunities for longer term revenue growth moody’s will continue to monitor this market and adapt to meet the changing needs of its participants 

the pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell which in the absence of the appropriate technology may not be readily or easily obtainable this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of established and newer capital markets as technology provides broader access to worldwide markets it also results in a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk data analytics and related services additionally information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support moody’s continued expansion in developing markets 

an ongoing trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets moody’s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems and that the trend of increased disintermediation will continue further disintermediation has continued because of the ongoing low interest rate environment and bank deleveraging which has encouraged a number of corporations and other entities to seek alternative funding in the bond markets 

 

 moody’s also observes disintermediation in key emerging markets where economic growth may outpace internal banking system capacity thus disintermediation is expected to continue over the longerterm with moody’s targeting investment and resources to those markets where disintermediation and bond issuance is expected to remain robust 

in response to the credit market disruptions beginning in mid2007 and ongoing volatility in the global capital markets and new regulatory requirements financial institutions are investing in people processes and systems to enhance risk management and compliance functions regulations such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act basel ii basel iii solvency ii and others may stimulate demand for ma products financial institutions are also investing in advanced qualitative and quantitative tools and services to support their management of complex balance sheets and diverse portfolios as well as operating costs ma offers a suite of risk management products and services to address these needs including but not limited to risk management software economic analysis training and professional services 

legislative bodies and regulators in the us europe and other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of cras which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of mis removal of references to ratings in certain regulations or increased costs of doing business for mis therefore in order to broaden the potential for expansion of nonratings services moody’s reorganized in january 2008 into two distinct businesses mis consisting primarily of the ratings business and ma which conducts activities including the sale of credit research produced by mis and the production and sale of other economic and creditrelated products and services the reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by ma into activities that may have otherwise been restricted for mis due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities 

moody’s operations are subject to various risks as more fully described in part i item 1a “risk factors” inherent in conducting business on a global basis such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions 

competition 

mis competes with other cras and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research many users of mis’s ratings also have inhouse credit research capabilities mis’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s ratings services sp a division of mcgraw hill financial there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp while in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp mis’s competitors include fitch ratings dominion bond rating service am best company japan credit rating agency ltd kroll bond rating agency inc morningstar inc and eganjones ratings company in europe examples of competitors include euler hermes rating feri eurorating services ag creditreform rating ag icap group and companhia portuguesa de rating there are additional competitors in other regions and countries for example in china where moody’s operates through a joint venture these competitors include china lianhe credit rating co ltd shanghai brilliance credit rating  investors service co ltd dagong global credit rating co ltd and pengyuan credit rating co ltd 

ma competes broadly in the financial information industry against diversified competitors such as thomson reuters bloomberg sp capital iq fitch solutions dun  bradstreet ibm wolters kluwer sungard sas fiserv msci and markit group among others ma’s main competitors within rda include sp capital iq creditsights thomson reuters intex ihs global insight blackrock solutions factset and other providers of fixed income analytics valuations economic data and research in ers ma faces competition from both large software providers such as ibm algorithmics sungard sas oracle misys oliver wyman verisk and various other vendors and inhouse solutions within professional services ma competes with omega performance dc gardner and a host of financial training and education firms and with evalueserve crisil global research  analytics and other providers of outsourced research and professional services respectively

mis and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the us and in other countries including by state and local authorities thus existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company’s operations and the markets for securities that it rates additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered each of the existing adopted proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which moody’s operates 

the regulatory landscape has changed rapidly in recent years and continues to evolve in the eu the cra industry is registered and supervised through a paneuropean regulatory framework the european securities and markets authority has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered cra industry throughout the eu mis is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed and additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services 

on january 6 2015 two additional rules generally referred to as “regulatory technical standards” or “rtss” of direct relevance to the cra industry were published in the official journal of the european union i cras’ reporting requirements to esma on their fees and ii the types of information that cras are to provide about certain ratings those that were paid for by issuers for publication on a central website administered by esma the european ratings platform the rtss were the final pieces of the rulemaking requirements 

 

 that cra3 imposed on esma and the eu’s legislative tripartite the european commission the european parliament and the council of the european union separately cra3 also requires that esma and  or the european commission produce several reports on the industry’s structure and the use of ratings these reports are expected to be published by year end 2015 

in the us cras are subject to extensive regulation primarily pursuant to the reform act and the financial reform act the sec is required by these legislative acts to publish two annual reports to congress on nrsros the financial reform act requires the sec to examine each nrsro once a year and issue an annual report summarizing the examination findings among other requirements the annual report required by the reform act details the sec’s views on the state of competition transparency and conflicts of interests among nrsros among other requirements 

the sec voted in august 2014 to adopt its final rules for nrsros as required by the financial reform act the final rules differ from earlier proposals by including additional measures regarding i sales and marketing activities and ii the design and enforcement of internal controls for the rating process the company has made and continues to make substantial it and other investments consequently the company will be in a position to implement the relevant compliance obligations by the set deadlines generally ranging from 60 days to 9 months following the september 15 2014 publication of the final rules in the federal register 

in light of the regulations that have gone into effect in both the eu and the us as well as many other countries from time to time and as a matter of course pursuant to their enabling legislation these regulatory authorities have and will continue to publish reports that describe their oversight activities over the industry in addition other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future finally in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which mis operates the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of the company cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

us laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry are rapidly evolving and may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us including the reform act and the financial reform act these regulations are complex continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time see “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information these laws and regulations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these laws and regulations and any future rulemaking or court rulings could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs which moody’s may be unable to pass through to customers in addition there may be uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations the company may be required to incur significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines penalties or other sanctions legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on moody’s business and its customers’ businesses and they may affect mis’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which mis’s ratings are developed assigned and communicated affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate impact the demand for mis’s ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business including by restricting or mandating business models for rating agencies further speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may affect moody’s stock price although these recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally they may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on moody’s operations profitability and competitiveness the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized 

financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

in addition to the extensive and evolving us laws and regulations governing the industry foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings in particular the eu has adopted a new regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the eu and introduced a common eu regulatory approach to oversight of cras the eu has established conditions for the issuance of credit ratings rules on the organization and conduct of cras—including restrictions on certain activities deemed to create a conflict of interest—and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments esma has direct supervisory authority for cras in the eu 

mis is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed and additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services 

on january 6 2015 two additional rules generally referred to as “regulatory technical standards” or “rtss” of direct relevance to the cra industry were published in the official journal of the european union i cras’ reporting requirements to esma on their fees and 

 

 ii the types of information that cras are to provide about certain ratings those that were paid for by issuers for publication on a central website administered by esma the european ratings platform separately cra3 also requires that esma and  or the european commission produce several reports on the industry’s structure and the use of ratings these reports are expected to be published by year end 2015 

eu financial reforms could have a significant negative effect on moody’s operations profitability or ability to compete or the markets for its products and services including in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict in particular exposure to increased liability under the eu regulations may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact moody’s results of operations in addition compliance with the amended eu regulations may increase costs of operations 

further moody’s believes there is still potential for additional rulemaking by the eu and other jurisdictions that can significantly impact operations or the markets for moody’s products and services such as regulations affecting the need for debt securities to be rated establishing criteria for credit ratings or limiting the entities authorized to provide credit ratings moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations and the effect that they will have on moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant financial reforms in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company faces exposure to litigation related to rating opinions and other business practices 

moody’s faces exposure to litigation related to mis’s ratings actions as well as other business practices as a result of difficult economic times and turbulent markets in recent years the market value of creditdependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased this development has led to a significant increase in the number of legal proceedings that moody’s is facing including class actions and other litigation government investigations and inquiries concerning events in the us subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the us in addition new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time furthermore to the extent that moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by moody’s increase substantially as does the risk of an adverse outcome see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the company currently faces due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought there is a risk that moody’s will be subject to judgments settlements fines penalties or other adverse results that could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to legal economic and regulatory risks of operating in multiple jurisdictions 

moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the company operates may have an impact on the company’s business for example economic uncertainty in the eurozone or elsewhere could affect the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas in addition operations abroad expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 additionally moody’s is subject to complex us and foreign laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other antibribery and anticorruption laws although the company has implemented internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices such measures may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that the company has violated antibribery or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on moody’s financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on moody’s reputation its ability to attract and retain employees its business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located including new york city the location of moody’s headquarters major cities worldwide in which moody’s has offices and locations in china used for data and development work this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure including the company’s electronic delivery systems data center facilities and the internet used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business whether due to human error natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political unrest war or otherwise moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful the company relies on thirdparty providers to provide certain essential services while the company believes that such providers are reliable the company has limited control over the performance of such providers to the extent any of the company’s thirdparty providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand its services to meet the company’s needs and the needs of the company’s customers the company could experience lower revenues and higher costs the company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations such persons’ ability to service and interact with moody’s clients and customers may suffer the company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the company’s failure or the failure of a third party to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions a disruption to moody’s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its clients in the company’s computer systems and networks and those of its third party vendors the cyber risks the company’s faces range from cyberattacks common to most industries to more advanced threats that target the company because of its prominence in the global marketplace or due to its ratings of sovereign debt breaches of moody’s or moody’s vendors’ technology and systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking computer viruses or malware employee error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data material interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s or such vendors’ web sites applications data processing or disruption of other business operations or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the company including information about moody’s business or customers as well as sensitive personally identifiable information “pii” the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft measures that moody’s takes to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or may become obsolete any material breaches of cybersecurity could cause the company to experience reputational harm loss of customers regulatory actions sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard the company’s clients’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results or financial condition 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the us and world financial markets furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional 

 

 parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional cras such as mis a majority of moody’s creditratingbased revenue is transactionbased and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets accordingly any market volatility or conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollarequivalent volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings therefore no assurance can be given as to the amount of revenues that may be derived from moody’s ratings services 

credit market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings economic and government factors such as a longterm continuation of difficult economic conditions and a worsening of the sovereign debt crisis in europe may have an adverse impact on the company’s business future debt issuances could be negatively affected by a sharp increase in longterm interest rates or factors which cause instability or volatility in the global capital markets such as significant regulatory political or economic events the use of alternative sources of credit including financial institutions and government sources and defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors changes in the markets for such securities and in the role and regulation of rating agencies may materially and adversely affect the company 

moody’s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient and cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term due in part to rent technology compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further costreduction initiatives including those undertaken to date could make it difficult for the company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings volatility in the financial markets including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition 

the company faces increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

there is price competition in the credit rating research credit risk management markets outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and certification services competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services as well as increased competition from nonnrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors at the same time the current challenging business environment and the consolidation of customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and result in reductions in the size of the company’s customer base tepid economic growth is also intensifying the competitive pressures as to pricing while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services it may lose market share if its pricing is not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors in addition the reform act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies the formation of additional nrsros may increase pricing and competitive pressures any inability of moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to reputation and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be significantly impacted factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities the timing and nature of changes in ratings a major compliance failure negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings regulators and legislative bodies including as to the ratings process and its implementation with respect to one or more securities operational errors whether by moody’s or a moody’s competitor could also harm the reputation of the company or the credit rating industry damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

the markets for credit ratings research credit risk management services outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and certification services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards the ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share moody’s competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources brand recognition market experience and technological expertise and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may position price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by moody’s moody’s also competes indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers these indirect competitors could choose to 

 

 compete directly with us in the future in addition customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and services and its growth prospects further the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive internet information may reduce the demand for moody’s products and services moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors any inability of moody to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company has a significant amount of intangible assets 

at december 31 2014 moody’s had 10211 million of goodwill and 3455 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet approximately 71 of these intangibles reside in the ma business and are allocated to the four reporting units within ma rda ers financial services training and certifications and copal amba the remaining 29 of these intangibles reside in mis and primarily relate to icra failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in an asset impairment charge which would result in a noncash charge to operating expenses goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be difficult as a result of increased uncertainty and current market dynamics and requires significant management estimates and judgment in addition the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty an asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures may negatively impact the company 

moody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries as greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies in the future moody’s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that could adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis there is a risk that even if the company invests significant resources in attempting to attract train and retain qualified personnel it will not succeed in its efforts and its business could be harmed 

moody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of raymond w mcdaniel jr the president and chief executive officer and other senior officers and key employees the loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results 

moody’s has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen its business and grow the company such transactions present significant challenges and risks the market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive especially in light of industry consolidation which may affect moody’s ability to complete such transactions if moody’s is unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise its business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

if such transactions are completed the anticipated growth synergies and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations technologies and new employees the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the company prior to closing a transaction unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business diverting management’s focus from other business operations and failing to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls procedures and policies the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected as a result the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the trading price of moody’s stock could be affected by third party actions 

ownership of moody’s stock is highly concentrated with a significant portion of shares held by a few institutional stockholders due to this concentrated stockholder base the trading price of moody’s stock could be affected considerably by actions of significant 

 

 stockholders to increase or decrease their positions in moody’s stock as a result the actions of these institutional stockholders could create high stock volatility 

the company’s compliance and risk management programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

moody’s operates in a number of countries and as a result the company is required to comply with numerous international and us federal state and local laws and regulations the company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations including anticorruption laws is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems moody’s policies and procedures to identify evaluate and manage the company’s risks may not be fully effective and moody’s employees or agents may engage in misconduct fraud or other errors it is not always possible to deter such errors and the precautions the company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases if moody’s employees violate its policies or if the company’s risk management methods are not effective the company could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer harm to the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

legal protections for the company’s intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or available to protect the company’s competitive advantages 

moody’s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary failure to protect the company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the company’s ability to compete effectively in addition the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets on january 6 2015 a rule with direct relevance to the cra industry was published in the official journal of the european union regarding the types of information that cras are to provide about certain ratings those that were paid for by issuers for publication on a central website administered by esma the european ratings platform this rule directly relates to the company’s intellectual property as it would require that the company provide proprietary information at no cost that the company currently sells which could result in lost revenue 

additionally despite the company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may try to obtain and use technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary even if moody’s attempts to protect its intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful 

the company is dependent on the use of thirdparty software data hosted solutions data centers and network infrastructure  together “third party technology”   and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or service offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

moody’s relies on third party technology in connection with its product development and offerings the company depends on the ability of third party technology providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the third party technology moody’s uses may become obsolete incompatible with future versions of the company’s products unavailable or fail to operate effectively and moody’s business could be adversely affected if the company is unable to timely or effectively replace such third party technology the company also monitors its use of third party technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements despite the company’s efforts the company cannot assure that such third parties will permit moody’s use in the future resulting in increased third party technology acquisition costs and loss of rights in addition the company’s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for third party technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to third party technology are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also moody’s competitors increasing the risks noted above if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets pension and other retirement benefits utps and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable 

pursuant to the guidance of asc topic 605 when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available third party evidence if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 

the company’s products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under asc topic 605 the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control in instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met the delivered item is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit 

the company determines whether its selling price in a multielement transaction meets the vsoe criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately in instances where the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple 

 

 element arrangement which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range or only having a limited sales history the company attempts to establish tpe for deliverables the company determines whether tpe exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers however due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing possible differences in the company’s market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the company may contain a significant level of differentiation andor customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained the company generally is unable to reliably determine tpe based on the selling price hierarchy established by asu 200913 when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe the company will establish an esp esp is the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis the company establishes its best estimate of esp considering internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives standalone sales prices of similar products percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service and customer segment and geography additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend the company reviews its determination of vsoe tpe and esp on an annual basis or more frequently as needed 

in the mis segment revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed generally one year in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities structured credit international residential mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities which was approximately 28 years on a weighted average basis at december 31 2014 at december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately 107 million 97 million and 82 million respectively 

multiple element revenue arrangements in the mis segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees the company generally uses esp in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for initial ratings 

mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 accounts receivable included approximately 22 million 21 million and 22 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings furthermore for certain annual monitoring services fees are not invoiced until the end of the monitoring period however revenue is recognized ratably over the monitoring period 

in the ma segment products and services offered by the company include software licenses and related maintenance subscriptions and professional services revenue from subscription based products such as research and data subscriptions and certain softwarebased credit risk management subscription products is recognized ratably over the related subscription period which is principally one year revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are performed if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs a large portion of annual research and data subscriptions as well as annual software maintenance is invoiced in november december and january of each year 

products and services offered within the ma segment are sold either standalone or together in various combinations in instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and nonsoftware deliverables revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition previously described 

if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using vsoe in the instances where the company is not able to determine vsoe for all of the deliverables of an arrangement the company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its vsoe and the residual revenue to the delivered elements if the company is unable to determine vsoe for an undelivered element the company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the company has delivered all of the elements or when vsoe has been determined for the undelivered elements in cases where software implementation services are considered essential and vsoe of fair value exists for postcontract customer support “pcs” once the delivery criteria have been met on the standard software license and 

 

 service revenue is recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as implementation services are performed while pcs is recognized over the coverage period if vsoe of fair value does not exist for pcs once the delivery criteria have been met on the standard software service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin basis until essential services are complete at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining pcs coverage period 

accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue based on historical experience and current conditions such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account writeoffs are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the company’s consolidated results of operations 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities 

for claims litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range in other instances because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation regulatory governmental investigations and inquiries enforcement and similar matters and contingencies particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also cannot predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition however in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time 

the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary insures the company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation employment practices litigation employee medical claims and terrorism for which the claims are not material to the company in addition for claim years 2008 and 2009 the insurance subsidiary insured the company for defense costs related to professional liability claims for matters insured by the company’s insurance subsidiary moody’s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion the company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management’s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates the cheyne siv and rhinebridge siv matters more fully discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements were both cases from the 20082009 claims period and accordingly the defense cost for these matters were insured by the company’s insurance subsidiary defense costs for matters not selfinsured by the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided 

for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic 740 of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained 

 

 based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

on july 31 of each year moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 

at july 31 2014 the company had six primary reporting units two within the company’s ratings business one for the newly acquired icra business and one that encompasses all of moody’s other ratings operations and four reporting units within ma rda ers fstc and copal amba the rda reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools the ers reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions primarily delivered via software that is licensed or sold on a subscription basis the fstc reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and implementation services the copal amba reporting unit provides outsourced research and analytical services in july 2014 a subsidiary of the company acquired webequity solutions llc a leading provider of cloudbased loan origination solutions for financial institutions webequity solutions operates as part of the ers reporting unit in october 2014 the company acquired lewtan technologies a leading provider of analytical tools and data for the global structured finance market lewtan operates as part of the rda reporting unit 

the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a threestep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level in the first step the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount if a determination is made that based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist the company is not required to perform further testing if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company must perform a third step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach the company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years at july 31 2013 the company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on all reporting units which resulted in no impairment of goodwill 

at july 31 2014 the company performed quantitative assessments of the fstc and copal amba reporting units and qualitative assessments for all remaining reporting units the qualitative analyses resulted in the company determining that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying amounts the most significant factors in these qualitative assessments were an assessment of actual to projected results and a comparison of projected results in the prior year compared to current year projection for each reporting unit additionally the weighted average cost of capital wacc is assessed as well as the impact of various macroeconomic conditions and factors specific to the reporting unit that could impact future cash flows no assessment was performed on the icra reporting unit due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the goodwill impairment assessment date accordingly the carrying value of icra’s net assets acquired approximates fair value at july 31 2014 

at july 31 2014 the company performed a quantitative analysis on the fstc reporting unit due to the small amount of excess of fair value over net assets in the prior year and slower than anticipated growth in projected cash flows than was utilized in the quantitative assessment performed at july 31 2013 this slower than anticipated growth in cash flows reflects various investment initiatives in the medium term for this business the company also performed a quantitative assessment on the copal amba reporting unit due to the acquisition of the amba business subsequent to the july 31 impairment test dates so as to establish a baseline fair value both of these quantitative assessments resulted in no impairment to goodwill at july 31 2014 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and appropriate comparable market metrics the company bases its fair value estimates on reasonable assumptions however as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from these estimates in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

 

 other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 

sensitivity analyses and key assumptions for deriving the fair value of a reporting unit 

the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december 31 2014 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units for the fstc and copal amba reporting units the fair value was calculated as of july 31 2014 for all remaining reporting units excluding ers the fair value was calculated as of july 31 2013 as there have been no qualitative factors that have resulted in the company deeming it necessary to perform a quantitative assessment subsequent to this date for ers the webequity price was added to the prior year fair value as the webequity purchase price approximated its fair value as of july 31 2014 due to the proximity of the acquisition to the goodwill impairment assessment date 

 

  

 as can be seen from the table above the reporting unit most at risk for potential impairment is the fstc reporting unit and failure to meet its financial projections could result in further goodwill impairment there was a goodwill impairment charge of 122 million for this reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2012 this business is in part sensitive to the staffing levels and profitability of the global financial services industry particularly in canada and emea 

based on the july 31 2013 valuation the ers reporting unit also carried some risk of potential impairment management of the ers reporting unit continues to focus on expanding market penetration as well as enhancing the scalability of its products and services this will reduce margins in the near term but is anticipated that it will enhance margins in the medium to longterm 

there could be a future goodwill impairment charge if fstc fails or ers significantly fails to meet its current financial plans 

methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining of the fair value of reporting units 

the following is a discussion regarding the company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units as of the date of each reporting unit’s last quantitative test july 31 2014 for fstc and copal amba july 31 2013 for the remaining reporting units excluding icra icra has not yet been subject to a full quantitative impairment analysis due to the proximity of the acquisition of this entity to the annual goodwill impairment assessment date 

the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples the dcf analysis requires significant estimates including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments 

 

 the sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions described below are as of the date of last quantitative assessment for each reporting unit the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology which requires significant management judgment 

 

  

 amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no such events or changes during 2014 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the company’s reporting units may not be recoverable this determination was made based on continued growth consistent with operating and strategic plans for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides additionally there were no events or circumstances during 2014 that would indicate the need for an adjustment of the remaining useful lives of these amortizable intangible assets 

pension and other retirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

 the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31 2014 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s retirement plans additionally the company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released rp2014 mortality tables and accompanying mortality improvement scale mp2014 to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the society of actuaries 

 

 when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise excluding differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets the company amortizes as a component of annual pension expense total outstanding gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets for moody’s retirement plans the total actuarial losses as of december 31 2014 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 1769 million and moody’s expects to recognize a net periodic expense of 139 million in 2015 related to the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded us pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under asc topic 715 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2014 the company has an unrecognized asset gain of 54 million of which 08 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2016 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2015 operating income these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2015 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s retirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  

 a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2015 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be 437 million in 2015 compared with 306 million in 2014 the expected expense increase in 2015 reflects the effects of higher benefit obligations primarily due to lower discount rate assumptions higher amortization of actuarial losses and a lower assumed long term rate of return on pension assets 

stockbased compensation 

the company records compensation expense for all sharebased payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant this includes stock options and restricted stock the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 

an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2014 dollars in millions 

 

 income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps the company classifies 

 

 interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

for utps asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

for certain of its nonus subsidiaries the company has deemed the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations accordingly the company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings it is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated dividend distributions from nonus subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s 

reportable segments 

the company is organized into two reportable segments at december 31 2014 mis and ma 

the mis segment is comprised primarily of all of the company’s ratings operations the mis segment consists of five lines of business – cfg sfg fig ppif and mis other the ratings lobs generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide the mis other lob consists of certain nonratings operations managed by mis which consists of nonrating revenue from icra as well as certain research and fixed income pricing service operations in the asiapacific region 

the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets the ma segment consists of three lines of business – rda ers and ps 

in december 2013 a subsidiary of the company acquired amba a provider of investment research and quantitative analytics for global financial institutions amba is part of the ma reportable segment and its revenue is included in the ps lob in june 2014 a subsidiary of the company acquired a controlling stake in icra a leading provider of credit ratings and research in india icra is part of the mis reportable segment and its ratings revenue is included in the respective ratings lobs of mis while its nonratings revenue is included in the mis other lob in july 2014 a subsidiary of the company acquired webequity a leading provider of cloudbased loan origination solutions for financial institutions webequity is part of the ma reporting segment and its revenue is included in the ers lob in october 2014 the company acquired lewtan a leading provider of analytical tools and data for the global structured finance market lewtan is part of the ma reportable segment and its revenue is included in the rda lob 

pursuant to the acquisition of icra the company realigned certain components of its reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2014 this realignment resulted in the creation of the mis other lob which now consists of nonratings revenue from icra as well as certain research and fixed income pricing revenue in the asiapacific region which was previously reported in the rda lob of ma these businesses are all managed by mis and the expenses from these operations will be included in the mis reportable segment all prior period results for both mis and ma have been restated to reflect this realignment and the impact of the realignment was not significant to mis’s or ma’s previously reported results 

the following is a discussion of the results of operations of the company and its reportable segments total mis revenue and total ma expenses include the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content data and products developed by mis the royalty rate charged by mis approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content data and products developed by mis total ma revenue and total mis expenses include intersegment fees charged to mis from ma for the 

 

 use of certain ma products and services in mis’s ratings process these fees charged by ma are generally equal to the costs incurred by ma to provide these products and services overhead charges and corporate expenses which exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment additionally overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company which benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a revenuesplit methodology overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy information technology and support staff such as finance human resources and information technology

executive summary 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 moody’s corporation 

 

  

 the table below shows moody’s global staffing by geographic area 

 

  

 global revenue of 33343 million in 2014 increased 3618 million compared to 2013 reflecting growth in both mis and ma the primary drivers of the increase in mis revenue reflect changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases primarily in the us coupled with growth in rated issuance volumes for clos investmentgrade corporate debt and bank loans also contributing to the growth were higher monitoring fees the growth in ma reflects higher revenue across all lobs the growth in rda resulted from increases in credit research licensing of ratings data and economic analysis and data while the growth in ps reflected revenue from the fourth quarter 2013 acquisition of amba as well as growth from the copal and fstc businesses the increase in ers was driven by growth across nearly all product offerings most notably in the assetliability and capital solutions credit origination 

 

 insurance and stresstesting verticals additionally ers revenue benefitted from the acquisition of webequity solutions in july 2014 transaction revenue accounted for 50 of global mco revenue in both 2014 and 2013 

us revenue of 18145 million in 2014 increased 1880 million over the prior year reflecting changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases within mis as well as growth in rated issuance volumes for investmentgrade corporate debt and clos also contributing to the growth were higher monitoring fees in mis and growth across all lobs within ma these increases were partially offset by declines in highyield corporate debt rated issuance volumes as well as declines in mis bankingrelated revenue which is primarily due to an unfavorable shift in issuance mix

operating expenses were 9303 million in 2014 and increased 1079 million from 2013 primarily due to an approximate 92 million increase in compensation costs reflecting higher salaries and related employee benefits resulting from the impact of annual compensation increases and growth in headcount due to incremental hires and the acquisitions of amba webequity icra and lewtan also contributing to the increase in compensation expenses were higher incentive compensation costs reflecting greater achievement against fullyear targeted results compared to the prior year additionally noncompensation expenses increased approximately 16 million primarily reflecting costs associated with the aforementioned acquisitions as well as higher costs to support investments in it infrastructure 

sga expenses of 8693 million in 2014 increased 472 million compared to the prior year period reflecting higher compensation and noncompensation expenses partially offset by the first quarter 2013 litigation settlement charge relating to two matters regarding structured finance transactions rated by mis as more fully discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements the growth in compensation costs of approximately 63 million was primarily due to higher salaries and related employee benefits resulting from annual compensation increases headcount growth in mis and ma as well as in overhead support areas coupled with higher headcount from acquisitions also contributing to the increase in compensation expenses were higher incentive compensation costs reflecting greater achievement against fullyear targeted results compared to the prior year coupled with headcount growth additionally there were higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately 13 million reflecting additional floors leased at the company’s 7wtc headquarters coupled with various other real estate expansion projects worldwide as well as higher costs to support investments in the company’s it infrastructure also incremental noncompensation expenses from acquisitions contributed to the expense growth

interest income expense net in 2014 was 1168 million a 250 million increase in net expense compared to 2013 this increase is primarily due to approximately 26 million in higher interest expense resulting from the issuance of the 2013 senior notes in august 2013 as well as the issuance of the 2014 senior notes 5year and 2014 senior notes 30year in july 2014 also the increase in interest expense included approximately 11 million in net costs net of a gain on the settlement of an interest rate swap relating to the early repayment of the series 20051 notes 

other nonoperating income expense net was 359 million in 2014 a 94 million increase in income compared to 2013 the increase reflects fx gains of 203 million in 2014 which is primarily due to strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro and british pound for certain us dollar denominated assets held in international jurisdictions this increase was partially offset by an approximate 13 million higher benefit from the resolution of legacy tax matters in 2013 compared to 2014 

the 1028 million icra gain related to a fair value remeasurement of the company’s previously held equity investment in icra which occurred in connection with moody’s acquiring a controlling stake in icra on june 26 2014

 global revenue of 29725 million in 2013 increased 2422 million compared to 2012 reflecting good growth in both reportable segments the increase in ratings revenue reflects benefits from changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases primarily in the us coupled with higher global rated issuance volumes for highyield corporate debt and bank loans the growth in ma reflects higher revenue across all lobs most notably in rda which benefited from solid demand for data and analytic products and in ers which was driven by the completion of certain software implementations transaction revenue accounted for 50 of global mco revenue in both 2013 and 2012 

us revenue of 16265 million increased 1541 million over 2012 reflecting growth across all ratings lobs most notably in cfg and sfg coupled with growth in all lobs within ma 

nonus revenue increased 881 million compared to 2012 reflecting higher cfg revenue in all regions coupled with increases in ma revenue within the emea and asiapacific regions these increases were partially offset by declines in all asset classes in sfg within the emea region 

operating expenses were 8224 million in 2013 an increase of 274 million from 2012 and reflected growth in both compensation and noncompensation costs the increase in compensation costs of approximately 11 million reflects higher salaries and related employee benefits of approximately 30 million primarily resulting from increases in headcount as well as the impact of annual compensation increases these increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation of approximately 21 million due to lower achievement against fullyear targeted results in 2013 compared to 2012 the growth in noncompensation expenses of approximately 17 million is primarily due to an increase in costs relating to ongoing it initiatives coupled with higher variable costs correlated with business growth 

sga expenses of 8221 million in 2013 increased 699 million from 2012 with the primary driver of the expense growth reflecting the settlement of the abu dhabi and rhinebridge litigation matters more fully discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements the remaining increase in sga expenses reflects growth in compensation costs of approximately 18 million primarily due to higher salaries and related employee benefits of approximately 26 million resulting from annual compensation increases and headcount growth in sales personnel within ma as well as in overhead support areas the growth in salaries and related employee benefits was partially offset by lower incentive compensation of approximately 10 million due to lower achievement against fullyear targeted results in 2013 compared to 2012 additionally there was a decline in noncompensation expenses excluding the aforementioned settlement for litigation matters which primarily reflected lower legal defense costs in 2013 following the first quarter litigation settlement these declines were partially offset by higher costs for ongoing it initiatives coupled with higher contingent consideration costs of approximately 7 million relating to the acquisition of copal

interest income expense net in 2013 was 918 million a 280 million increase in expense compared to 2012 this increase is due to higher interest on borrowings reflecting the issuance of the 2012 senior notes and the 2013 senior notes in august 2012 and 2013 respectively partially offset by lower interest expense due to the final repayment of the 2008 term loan in may 2013 also the increase in expense reflects an approximate 7 million reversal of interest on utps in 2012 related to the settlement of state and local tax audits 

other nonoperating income expense net was 265 million in 2013 a 161 million increase in income compared to 2012 and reflected approximately 6 million in fx losses in 2012 compared to immaterial gains in 2013 the fx losses in 2012 primarily related to the decline of the euro relative to the british pound in the prior year also contributing to the increase in income was a higher legacy tax benefit in 2013 compared to 2012 192 million in 2013 compared to 128 million in 2012 

 

 the company’s etr was 302 in 2013 down from 317 in 2012 the decrease was primarily due to us tax legislation enacted in early 2013 which retroactively extended certain tax benefits to the 2012 tax year and prospectively extended these benefits to the 2013 tax year as well as tax benefits on the aforementioned litigation settlement charge 

net income in 2013 was 8045 million or 360 per diluted share and included a 014 charge related to the aforementioned litigation settlement in the first quarter of 2013 as well as a 009 benefit relating to the resolution of a legacy tax matter this is an increase of 1145 million or 055 per diluted share compared to 2012 which included a 006 benefit relating to a legacy tax matter excluding the charge for the litigation settlement in 2013 and the legacy tax benefits in both years nongaap diluted eps of 365 in 2013 was 066 higher than in the same period of the prior year

credit and interest rate risk 

the company’s interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates the company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed rate of interest on certain of its borrowings to a floating rate based on the 3month libor these swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing while net interest payments are recorded as interest expenseincome in the company’s consolidated statement of operations a hypothetical change of 100bps in the liborbased swap rate would result in an approximate 24 million change to the fair value of these interest rate swaps additional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k 

moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in highquality investmentgrade securities within and outside the us with maturities of three months or less when purchased the company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds money market deposit accounts certificates of deposit and issuers of highgrade commercial paper and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer shortterm investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit

the repayment schedule for the company’s borrowings is as follows 

 

 management may consider pursuing additional longterm financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations share repurchases and other strategic opportunities which would result in higher financing costs 

other material future cash requirements 

the company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow for the next twelve months cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the company’s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements the company may also borrow from various sources

 nongaap financial measures 

in addition to its reported results moody’s has included in this mda certain adjusted results that the sec defines as “nongaap financial measures” management believes that such nongaap financial measures when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the company’s performance facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental 

 

 information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking these nongaap measures as defined by the company are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies furthermore these nongaap measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other gaap measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the company below are brief descriptions of the company’s nongaap financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the nongaap measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure 

adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin 

the company presents adjusted operating income because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating performance of moody’s measuring the company’s ability to service debt fund capital expenditures and expand its business adjusted operating income excludes depreciation and amortization as well as goodwill impairment charges because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring productive assets including goodwill companies also have different methods of depreciating and amortizing productive assets as well as different methods of valuing goodwill management believes that the exclusion of certain items detailed in the reconciliation below allows for a more meaningful comparison of the company’s operating results from period to period and across companies below is a reconciliation of the company’s operating income and operating margin to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin 

 

 nongaap diluted eps 

the company presents this nongaap measure to exclude the impact of litigation settlements legacy tax matters and the icra gain to allow for a more meaningful comparison of moody’s diluted earnings per share from period to period the impact of litigation settlement relates to the settlement of two legal matters in the first quarter of 2013 which are more fully discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements the legacy tax items are specific to the company resulting from the 2000 distribution the icra gain resulted from the company acquiring a controlling interest in icra in 2014 below is a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable us gaap amount 

 

 free cash flow 

the company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital additions management believes that free cash flow is a useful metric in assessing the company’s cash flows to service debt pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases management deems capital expenditures essential to the company’s product and service innovations and 

 

 maintenance of moody’s operational capabilities accordingly capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of moody’s cash flow below is a reconciliation of the company’s net cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow 

 

 2015 outlook 

moody’s outlook for 2015 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates foreign currency exchange rates corporate profitability and business investment spending merger and acquisition activity consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued there is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook the company’s guidance assumes foreign currency translation at endof2014 exchange rates with the exception of the british pound £ and the euro  €  which assume foreign currency translation of 151 to £1 and 115 to € 1 respectively

the company 

moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings ii credit capital markets and economic related research data and analytical tools iii software solutions and related risk management services iv quantitative credit risk measures financial services training and certification services and v outsourced research and analytical services to institutional customers moody’s reports in two reportable segments mis and ma the mis segment consists of all credit rating activity all of moody’s other nonrating commercial activities are included within the ma segment financial information and operating results of these segments including revenue expenses and operating income are included in part ii item 8 financial statements of this annual report and are herein incorporated by reference 

mis publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide including various corporate and governmental obligations structured finance securities and commercial paper programs revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to investors mis provides ratings in more than 120 countries ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media including the internet and realtime information systems widely used by securities traders and investors as of december 31 2013 mis had ratings relationships with approximately 11000 corporate issuers and approximately 21000 public finance issuers additionally the company has rated and currently monitors ratings on approximately 76000 structured finance obligations representing approximately 12000 transactions the aforementioned amounts relating to the number of issuers and transactions represent issuers or transactions that had an active rating at any point during the year ended december 31 2013

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and the types of securities or other obligations outstanding beginning in mid2007 there was a severe market disruption and associated financial crisis both in the 

 

 developed and emerging markets resulting in a global decline in issuance activity for some significant asset classes and weak economic performance in advanced economies since this financial crisis many markets and economies have recovered and moody’s believes that the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixedincome market and related financial information market which includes information such as credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 moody’s is well positioned to benefit from a continued recovery in global fixedincome market activity and a more informed use of credit ratings as well as research and related analytical products in an environment with heightened attention to credit risk analysis and management moody’s expects that these developments will support continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions research data analytics risk management tools and related services 

strong secular trends will continue to provide longterm growth opportunities moody’s key growth drivers include debt market issuance driven by global gdp growth continued disintermediation of fixedincome markets in both developed and emerging economies that drives issuance and demand for new products and services growth in ma driven by further penetration of ma’s client base and expansion of bank and insurance risk regulatory requirements pricing opportunities aligned with value and advances in information technology 

growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates business investment spending corporate refinancing needs merger and acquisition activity issuer profits consumer borrowing levels and securitization activity rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the dollarequivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets mis’s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and the prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decisions however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings and other areas partially mitigate mis’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixedincome markets furthermore the strong growth trend seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid1990’s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010 before stabilizing in 2011 with moody’s experiencing revenue growth in this market in 2012 in 2013 moody’s experienced revenue growth in the us structured credit and commercial real estate subsectors of the structured finance market but also experienced a decline in nonus structured finance revenue most notably in emea despite significant declines from peak market issuance levels moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global fixedincome markets and will provide opportunities for longer term revenue growth moody’s will continue to monitor this market and adapt to meet the changing needs of its participants 

the pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell which in the absence of the appropriate technology may not be readily or easily obtainable this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of established and newer capital markets as technology provides broader access to worldwide markets it also results in a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk data analytics and related services additionally information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support moody’s continued expansion in developing markets 

an ongoing trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets credit market disruptions which began in mid2007 temporarily slowed the trend of disintermediation globally moody’s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems and that the trend of increased disintermediation will continue in fact disintermediation continued in the past year because of the ongoing low interest rate environment and ongoing 

 

 bank deleveraging which has encouraged a number of corporations and other entities to seek alternative funding in the bond markets moody’s also observes disintermediation in key emerging markets where economic growth may outpace internal banking system capacity thus disintermediation is expected to continue over the longerterm with moody’s continuing to target investment and resources to those markets where disintermediation and bond issuance is expected to remain robust 

in response to the credit market disruptions beginning in mid2007 and ongoing volatility in the global capital markets and new regulatory requirements financial institutions are investing in people processes and systems to enhance risk management and compliance functions regulations such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act basel ii basel iii solvency ii and others may stimulate demand for ma products financial institutions are also investing in advanced qualitative and quantitative tools and services to support their management of complex balance sheets and diverse portfolios ma offers a suite of risk management products and services to address these needs including but not limited to risk management software economic analysis training and professional services 

legislative bodies and regulators in the us europe and selective other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of cras which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of mis removal of references to ratings in certain regulations or increased costs of doing business for mis therefore in order to broaden the potential for expansion of nonratings services moody’s reorganized in january 2008 into two distinct businesses mis consisting solely of the ratings business and ma which conducts all nonratings activities including the sale of credit research produced by mis and the production and sale of other economic and creditrelated products and services the reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by ma into activities that may have otherwise been restricted for mis due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities

regulation 

mis and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the us and in other countries including by state and local authorities thus existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company’s operations and the markets for securities that it rates additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered each of the existing adopted proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which moody’s operates 

in the eu the cra industry is registered and supervised through a paneuropean regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions in 2009 the european parliament passed a new regulation “cra1” that established an oversight regime for the cra industry in the eu cra1 which required the registration formal regulation and periodic inspection of cras operating in the eu became fully effective in september 2010 mis applied for registration in august 2010 and was granted registration in october 2011 in january 2011 cra2 established the european securities and markets authority esma has had direct supervisory responsibility for the registered cra industry throughout the eu since july 2011 

in the summer of 2013 a new set of rules that augmented the cras’ supervisory framework went into effect commonly referred to as cra3 these new rules among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 certain of the provisions of cra3 will be subject to esma rulemaking and it is expected that process will happen within the year 

in december 2012 the staff of the sec’s trading and markets division published a “report to congress on assigned credit ratings” in the report commonly referred to as the franken amendment study the sec staff identified several potential courses of action without endorsing any of them and noted that any changes through sec rulemaking would require additional study of relevant information the timing regarding the remainder of the sec’s rulemaking under the financial reform act remains uncertain 

in light of the regulations that have gone into effect in both the eu and the us as well as many other countries from time to time and as a matter of course pursuant to their enabling legislation these regulatory authorities have and will continue to publish reports that describe their oversight activities over the industry in addition other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future finally in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which mis operates the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of the company cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

 item 1a   risk factors tableend the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occur moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on form 10k 

us laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry are rapidly evolving and may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us including the reform act and the financial reform act these regulations are complex continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time see “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information these laws and regulations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these laws and regulations and any future rulemaking could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs which moody’s may be unable to pass through to customers in addition there may be uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations the company may be required to incur significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines penalties or other sanctions legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on moody’s business and its customers’ businesses and they may affect mis’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which mis’s ratings are developed assigned and communicated affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate impact the demand for mis’s ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business including by restricting or mandating business models for rating agencies further speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may affect moody’s stock price although these recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally they may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on moody’s operations profitability and competitiveness the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized 

financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

in addition to the extensive and evolving us laws and regulations governing the industry foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings in particular the eu has adopted a new regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the eu and introduced a common eu regulatory approach to oversight of cras the eu has established conditions for the issuance of credit ratings rules on the organization and conduct of cras—including restrictions on certain activities deemed to create a conflict of interest—and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments esma has direct supervisory authority for cras in the eu 

the amendments adopted by the european parliament to its existing cra regulations generally referred to as cra3 became effective on june 20 2013 as adopted cra3 among other things imposes i various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers ii requirements that member states to adopt laws imposing liability on cras for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations iii mandatory rotation requirements on cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings on resecuritizations which may limit the number of years a cra can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer iv restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed v additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services 

 

 eu financial reforms could have a significant negative effect on moody’s operations profitability or ability to compete or the markets for its products and services including in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict in particular exposure to increased liability under the eu regulations may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact moody’s results of operations in addition compliance with the amended eu regulations may increase costs of operations 

further moody’s believes there is still potential for additional rulemaking by the eu and other jurisdictions that can significantly impact operations or the markets for moody’s products and services such as regulations affecting the need for debt securities to be rated establishing criteria for credit ratings or limiting the entities authorized to provide credit ratings moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations and the effect that they will have on moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant financial reforms in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company faces exposure to litigation related to rating opinions 

moody’s faces exposure to litigation related to mis’s ratings actions as well as other business practices as a result of difficult economic times and turbulent markets in recent years the market value of creditdependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased this development has led to a significant increase in the number of legal proceedings that moody’s is facing including class actions and other litigation government investigations and inquiries concerning events in the us subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the us in addition new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time furthermore to the extent that moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by moody’s increase substantially as does the risk of an adverse outcome see “contingencies” for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the company currently faces due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought there is a risk that moody’s will be subject to judgments settlements fines penalties or other adverse results that could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to legal economic and regulatory risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions 

moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the company operates may have an impact on the company’s business for example economic uncertainty in the eurozone or elsewhere could affect the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas in addition operations abroad expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 additionally moody’s is subject to complex us and foreign laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other antibribery and anticorruption laws although the company has implemented internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices such measures may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that the company has violated antibribery or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on moody’s financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on moody’s reputation its ability to attract and retain employees its business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located including new york city the location of moody’s headquarters and major cities worldwide in which moody’s has offices this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business whether due to human error natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political unrest war or otherwise moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful the company relies on thirdparty providers to provide certain essential services while the company believes that such providers are reliable the company has limited control over the performance of such providers to the extent any of the company’s thirdparty providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand its services to meet the company’s needs and the needs of the company’s customers the company could experience lower revenues and higher costs the company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations such persons’ ability to service and interact with moody’s clients and customers may suffer we cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure or the failure of a third party to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions a disruption to moody’s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive and other types of information in the company’s computer systems and networks and those of its third party vendors the cyber risks we face range from cyberattacks common to most industries to more advanced threats that target the company because of its prominence in the global marketplace or due to its ratings of sovereign debt breaches of our or our vendors’ technology and systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking computer viruses or malware employee error malfeasance physical breaches or other actions may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s or such vendors’ web sites applications or data processing or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding the company or our business or customers measures that moody’s takes to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or may become obsolete any material incidents could cause the company to experience reputational harm loss of customers regulatory actions sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results or financial condition 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the us and world financial markets furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional cras such as mis a majority of moody’s creditratingbased revenue is transactionbased and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets accordingly any market volatility or conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollarequivalent volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings therefore no assurance can be given as to the amount of revenues that may be derived from moody’s ratings services 

credit market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings economic and government factors such as a longterm continuation of difficult economic conditions uncertainty regarding the us debt ceiling and a worsening of the sovereign debt crisis in europe may have an adverse impact on the company’s business future debt issuances could be negatively affected by a sharp increase in longterm 

 

 interest rates or factors which cause instability or volatility in the global capital markets such as significant regulatory political or economic events the use of alternative sources of credit including financial institutions and government sources and defaults of significant issuers changes in the markets for such securities and in the role and regulation of rating agencies may materially and adversely affect the company 

the timing nature extent and sustainability of any recovery in the credit and other financial markets is uncertain and a prolonged period of market decline or weakness could have a material adverse effect on the business moody’s initiatives to reduce costs may not be sufficient and further cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term due in part to rent technology compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further the costreduction initiatives undertaken to date could make it difficult for the company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the credit markets and the resulting demand for ratings volatility in the financial markets including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition 

the company faces increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

there is intense price competition in the credit rating research credit risk management markets outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and certification services competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services as well as increased competition from nonnrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors at the same time bankruptcies consolidation of customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors tepid economic growth is also intensifying the competitive pressures as to pricing while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services it may lose market share if its pricing is not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors in addition the reform act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies the formation of additional nrsros may increase pricing as well as other competitive pressures any inability of moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to reputation and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be significantly impacted factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities the timing and nature of changes in ratings a major compliance failure negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings regulators and legislative bodies including as to the ratings process and its implementation with respect to one or more securities operational errors whether by moody’s or a moody’s competitor could also harm the reputation of the company or the credit rating industry damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

the markets for credit ratings research credit risk management services outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and certification services are highly competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share moody’s competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources brand recognition market experience and technological expertise and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by moody’s customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and services and its growth prospects in addition the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive internet information may reduce the demand for moody’s products and services moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors any inability of moody to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company has a significant amount of intangible assets 

at december 31 2013 moody’s had 6652 million of goodwill and 2216 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet approximately 99 of these intangibles reside in the ma business and are allocated to the four reporting units within ma rda ers financial services training and certifications and copal amba failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in an asset impairment charge which would result in a noncash charge to operating expenses goodwill 

 

 and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be difficult as a result of increased uncertainty and current market dynamics and requires significant management estimates and judgment in addition the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty an asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures may negatively impact the company 

moody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries as greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies in the future moody’s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that could adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis there is a risk that even if the company invests significant resources in attempting to attract train and retain qualified personnel it will not succeed in its efforts and its business could be harmed

moody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of raymond w mcdaniel jr the president and chief executive officer and other senior officers and key employees the loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results 

moody’s has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen its business and grow the company such transactions present significant challenges and risks the market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive especially in light of industry consolidation which may affect moody’s ability to complete such transactions if moody’s is unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise its business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

if such transactions are completed the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions for instance the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated the company may assume unintended liabilities there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures the company may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management’s focus from other business operations the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected as a result the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

the trading price of moody’s stock could be affected by third party actions 

ownership of moody’s stock is highly concentrated with a significant portion of shares held by a few institutional stockholders due to this concentrated stockholder base the trading price of moody’s stock could be affected considerably by actions of significant stockholders to increase or decrease their positions in moody’s stock as a result the actions of these institutional stockholders could create high stock volatility

in addition the company is facing litigation from market participants relating to the performance of mis rated securities although moody’s in the normal course experiences such litigation the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased following the events in the us subprime residential mortgage sector and global credit markets more broadly over the last several years

in october 2009 plaintiffs king county washington and iowa student loan liquidity corporation each filed substantially identical putative class actions in the southern district of new york against two subsidiaries of the company and several other defendants including two other rating agencies and ikb deutsche industriebank ag these actions arose out of investments in securities issued by a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge plc the “rhinebridge siv” and sought among other things compensatory and punitive damages each complaint asserted a claim for common law fraud against the rating agency defendants alleging among other things that the credit ratings assigned to the securities issued by the rhinebridge siv were false and misleading the case was assigned to the same judge presiding over the litigation concerning the cheyne siv described above in april 2010 the court denied the rating agency defendants’ motion to dismiss in june 2010 the court consolidated the two cases and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that among other things added morgan stanley  co as a defendant in january 2012 in light of new new york state case law the court permitted the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint that asserted claims against the rating agency defendants for breach of fiduciary duty negligence negligent misrepresentation and aiding and abetting claims in may 2012 the court ruling on the rating agency defendants’ motion to dismiss dismissed all of the new claims except for the negligent misrepresentation claim and a claim for aiding and abetting fraud on september 28 2012 after further proceedings the court also dismissed the negligent misrepresentation claim plaintiffs did not seek class certification on september 7 2012 the rating agencies filed a motion for summary judgment dismissing the remaining claims against them on january 3 2013 the court issued an order dismissing the claim for aiding and abetting fraud against the rating agencies but allowing the claim for fraud to proceed to trial in june 2012 and march 2013 respectively defendants ikb deutsche industriebank ag and a related entity and fitch inc informed the court that they had executed confidential settlement agreements with the plaintiffs on april 24 2013 pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement the plaintiffs stipulated to the voluntary dismissal with prejudice of all remaining claims as against the remaining defendants including moody’s and the court so ordered that stipulation on april 26 2013

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moody’s corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

this mda contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” commencing on page 58 and item 1a “risk factors” commencing on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties risks and other factors associated with these statements 

the company 

moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings ii credit and economic related research data and analytical tools iii software solutions and related risk management services iv quantitative credit risk measures financial services training and certification services and v outsourced research and analytical services to institutional customers moody’s has two reportable segments mis and ma 

mis the credit rating agency publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors 

the ma segment which includes all of the company’s nonrating commercial activities develops a wide range of products and services that primarily support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets within its rda business ma distributes research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies and commentary on topical creditrelated events it also provides fixed income pricing services in the asiapacific region the rda business also produces economic research as well as data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores within its ers business ma provides software solutions as well as related risk management services the ps business provides outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and certification programs 

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets pension and other retirement benefits utps and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable 

pursuant to the guidance of asc topic 605 when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available third party evidence if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 

the company’s products and services will generally continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under asc topic 605 the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control in instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met the delivered item is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit 

the company determines whether its selling price in a multielement transaction meets the vsoe criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately in instances where the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately not selling products within a 

 

 reasonably narrow price range or only having a limited sales history the company attempts to establish tpe for deliverables the company determines whether tpe exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers however due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing possible differences in the company’s market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the company may contain a significant level of differentiation andor customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained the company generally is unable to reliably determine tpe based on the selling price hierarchy established by asu 200913 when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe the company will establish an esp esp is the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis the company establishes its best estimate of esp considering internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives standalone sales prices of similar products percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service and customer segment and geography additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend the company reviews its determination of vsoe tpe and esp on an annual basis or more frequently as needed 

in the mis segment revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed generally one year in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities derivatives international residential mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities which was approximately 30 years on a weighted average basis at december 31 2013 at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately 97 million 82 million and 79 million respectively 

multiple element revenue arrangements in the mis segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees the company generally uses esp in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for initial ratings 

mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 accounts receivable included approximately 21 million 22 million and 24 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings furthermore for certain annual monitoring services fees are not invoiced until the end of the monitoring period however revenue is recognized ratably over the monitoring period 

in the ma segment products and services offered by the company include software licenses and related maintenance subscriptions and professional services revenue from subscription based products such as research and data subscriptions and certain softwarebased credit risk management subscription products is recognized ratably over the related subscription period which is principally one year revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period revenue from services rendered within the professional services line of business is generally recognized as the services are performed if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs a large portion of annual research and data subscriptions as well as annual software maintenance is invoiced in november december and january of each year 

products and services offered within the ma segment are sold either standalone or together in various combinations in instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and nonsoftware deliverables revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition previously described 

if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using vsoe in the instances where the company is not able to determine vsoe for all of the deliverables of an arrangement the company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its vsoe and the residual revenue to the delivered elements if the company is unable to determine vsoe for an undelivered element the company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the company has delivered all of the elements or when vsoe has been determined for the undelivered elements in cases where software implementation services are considered essential and vsoe of fair value exists for postcontract customer support “pcs” once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software license and service revenue is recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as implementation services are performed while pcs is recognized 

 

 over the coverage period if vsoe of fair value does not exist for pcs once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin basis until essential services are complete at which point total arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining pcs coverage period 

accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue based on historical experience and current conditions such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account writeoffs are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the company’s consolidated results of operations 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in the “contingencies” section of this “mda” commencing on page 56 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities 

for claims litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range in other instances because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation regulatory governmental investigations and inquiries enforcement and similar matters and contingencies particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also cannot predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition however in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time 

the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary insures the company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation employment practices litigation employee medical claims and terrorism for which the claims are not material to the company in addition for claim years 2008 and 2009 the insurance subsidiary insured the company for defense costs related to professional liability claims for matters insured by the company’s insurance subsidiary moody’s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion the company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management’s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates the cheyne siv and rhinebridge siv matters more fully discussed in the “contingencies” section of this mda were both cases from the 20082009 claims period and accordingly the defense cost for these matters were insured by the company’s insurance subsidiary defense costs for matters not selfinsured by the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided 

for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic 740 of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowl

 

 edge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

on july 31 of each year moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 

at july 31 2013 the company had five primary reporting units one in mis that encompasses all of moody’s ratings operations and four reporting units within ma rda ers fstc and copal the rda reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools the ers reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software licenses and related maintenance and implementation services the fstc reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and certification services copal which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 provides outsourced research and analytical services and was a separate reporting unit since its acquisition on december 10 2013 a subsidiary of the company acquired amba investment services which was combined with copal to form the copal amba reporting unit 

the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a threestep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level in the first step the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount if a determination is made that based on the qualitative factors an impairment does not exist the company is not required to perform further testing if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company must perform a third step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude on impairment using only a qualitative approach the company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years at july 31 2013 the company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on all reporting units which resulted in no impairment of goodwill 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and appropriate comparable market metrics the company bases its fair value estimates on reasonable assumptions however as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from these estimates in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit at the date when an acquisition is integrated into one of the established reporting units and is based on which reporting unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 

 

 sensitivity analyses and key assumptions for deriving the fair value of a reporting unit 

the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december 31 2013 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350 as of july 31 2013 assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values 

 

  

 as can be seen from the table above the reporting unit most at risk for potential impairment is the fstc reporting unit and failure to meet its financial projections could result in further goodwill impairment there was a goodwill impairment charge of 122 million for this reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2012 this business is in part sensitive to the staffing levels and profitability of the global financial services industry particularly in canada and emea 

the ers reporting unit also carries some risk of potential impairment management of the ers reporting unit is currently focused on expanding market penetration as well as enhancing the scalability of its products and services while the business continues to expand its customer footprint operating margins are expected to remain lower than previously anticipated 

there could be a future goodwill impairment charge if fstc fails or ers significantly fails to meet its current financial projections 

methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units 

the following is a discussion regarding the company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units as of july 31 2013 

the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples the dcf analysis requires significant estimates including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments 

 

 the sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions described below are as of july 31 2013 the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology which requires significant management judgment 

 

  

 amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no such events or changes during 2013 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the company’s reporting units may not be recoverable this determination was made based on improving market conditions for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides and an assessment of projected cash flows for all reporting units additionally there were no events or circumstances during the 2013 that would indicate the need for an adjustment of the remaining useful lives of these amortizable intangible assets 

pension and other retirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

 the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31 2013 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s retirement plans 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise excluding differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets the company amortizes as a component of annual pension expense total outstanding gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value 

 

 of plan assets for moody’s retirement plans the total actuarial losses as of december 31 2013 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 952 million and moody’s expects to recognize a net periodic expense of 60 million in 2014 related to the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded us pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under asc topic 715 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2013 the company has an unrecognized asset gain of 82 million of which 18 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2015 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2014 operating income these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2014 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s retirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  

 a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2014 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be 296 million in 2014 compared with 346 million in 2013 the expected expense decrease in 2014 reflects the effects of lower benefit obligations primarily due to higher discount rate assumptions and lower amortization of actuarial losses

the company records compensation expense for all sharebased payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant this includes stock options and restricted stock the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 

an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2013 dollars in millions 

 

 income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

 

 for utps asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

for certain of its nonus subsidiaries the company has deemed the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations accordingly the company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings it is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated dividend distributions from nonus subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s 

operating segments 

the company is organized into two reportable segments at december 31 2013 mis and ma the mis segment is comprised of all of the company’s ratings activities all of moody’s other nonrating commercial activities are included in the ma segment 

the mis segment consists of four lines of business – corporate finance structured finance financial institutions and public project and infrastructure finance – that generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide 

the ma segment which includes all of the company’s nonrating commercial activities develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets the ma segment consists of three lines of business – rda ers and ps in the first quarter of 2013 a portion of a division within the ps lob that provides solutions for structured finance securities was transferred to the rda lob additionally in the first quarter of 2012 a division within the ps lob that provides various financial modeling services was transferred to the ers lob accordingly the prior year revenue by lob for ma has been reclassified to reflect these transfers 

in december 2013 a subsidiary of the company acquired amba a provider of investment research and quantitative analytics for global financial institutions in the fourth quarter of 2011 subsidiaries of the company acquired bh and a majority interest in copal bh is a provider of insurance risk management tools copal is an outsourced research and consulting business amba bh and copal are part of the ma segment and bh’s revenue is included in the ers lob while amba and copal’s revenue is included in the ps lob 

the following is a discussion of the results of operations of these segments including the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content data and products developed by mis the royalty rate charged by mis approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content data and products developed by mis the discussion also includes intersegment fees charged to mis from ma for the use of certain ma products and services in mis’s ratings process these fees charged by ma are generally equal to the costs incurred by ma to provide these products and services overhead charges and corporate expenses which exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment additionally overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company which benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a revenuesplit methodology overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy information technology and support staff such as finance human resources and information technology 

beginning on january 1 2013 the company refined its methodology for allocating certain overhead departments to its segments to better align the costs allocated based on each segment’s usage of the overhead service the refined methodology is reflected in the segment results for the year ended december 31 2013 and accordingly the segment results for the prior year comparative periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation these reclassifications were not material

 global revenue of 29725 million in 2013 increased 2422 million compared to 2012 reflecting good growth in both reportable segments the increase in ratings revenue reflects benefits from changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases primarily in the us coupled with higher global rated issuance volumes for highyield corporate debt and bank loans the growth in ma reflects higher revenue across all lobs most notably in rda which benefited from solid demand for data and analytic products and in ers which was driven by the completion of certain software implementations transaction revenue accounted for 50 of global mco revenue in both 2013 and 2012 

us revenue of 16265 million increased 1541 million over 2012 reflecting growth across all ratings lobs most notably in cfg and sfg coupled with growth in all lobs within ma 

nonus revenue increased 881 million compared to 2012 reflecting higher cfg revenue in all regions coupled with increases in ma revenue within the emea and asiapacific regions these increases were partially offset by declines in all asset classes in sfg within the emea region 

operating expenses were 8224 million in 2013 an increase of 274 million from 2012 and reflected growth in both compensation and noncompensation costs the increase in compensation costs of approximately 11 million reflects higher salaries and related employee benefits of approximately 30 million primarily resulting from increases in headcount as well as the impact of annual compensation increases these increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation of approximately 21 million due to lower achievement against fullyear targeted results in 2013 compared to 2012 the growth in noncompensation expenses of approximately 17 million is primarily due to an increase in costs relating to ongoing it initiatives coupled with higher variable costs correlated with business growth 

sga expenses of 8221 million in 2013 increased 699 million from 2012 with the primary driver of the expense growth reflecting the settlement of the abu dhabi and rhinebridge litigation matters more fully discussed in the “contingencies” section of this mda the remaining increase in sga expenses reflects growth in compensation costs of approximately 18 million primarily due to higher salaries and related employee benefits of approximately 26 million resulting from annual compensation increases and headcount growth in sales personnel within ma as well as in overhead support areas the growth in salaries and related employee benefits was partially offset by lower incentive compensation of 10 million due to lower achievement against fullyear targeted results in 2013 compared to 2012 additionally there was a decline in noncompensation expenses excluding the aforementioned settlement for litigation matters which primarily reflected lower legal defense costs in 2013 following the first quarter litigation settlement these declines were partially offset by higher costs for ongoing it initiatives coupled with higher contingent consideration costs of approximately 7 million relating to the acquisition of copal 

operating income of 12346 million increased 1572 million from 2012 adjusted operating income was 13280 million in 2013 and increased 1449 million compared to 2012 operating margin and adjusted operating margin of 415 and 447 respectively increased 200bps and 140bps respectively compared to the prior year the increased margins reflected good revenue growth in both reportable segments outpacing operating expense growth 

interest income expense net in 2013 was 918 million a 280 million increase in expense compared to 2012 this increase is due to higher interest on borrowings reflecting the issuance of the 2012 senior notes and the 2013 senior notes in august 2012 and 2013 respectively partially offset by lower interest expense due to the final repayment of the 2008 term loan in may 2013 also the increase in expense reflects an approximate 7 million reversal of interest on utps in 2012 related to the settlement of state and local tax audits 

other nonoperating income expense net was 265 million in 2013 a 161 million increase in income compared to 2012 and reflected approximately 6 million in fx losses in 2012 compared to immaterial gains in 2013 the fx losses in 2012 primarily related to the decline of the euro relative to the british pound in the prior year also contributing to the increase in income was a higher legacy tax benefit in 2013 compared to 2012 192 million in 2013 compared to 128 million in 2012 

 

 the company’s etr was 302 in 2013 down from 317 in 2012 the decrease was primarily due to us tax legislation enacted in early 2013 which retroactively extended certain tax benefits to the 2012 tax year and prospectively extended these benefits to the 2013 tax year as well as tax benefits on the aforementioned litigation settlement charge 

net income in 2013 was 8045 million or 360 per diluted share and included a 014 charge related to the aforementioned litigation settlement in the first quarter of 2013 as well as a 009 benefit relating to the resolution of a legacy tax matter this is an increase of 1145 million or 055 per diluted share compared to 2012 which included a 006 benefit relating to a legacy tax matter excluding the charge for the litigation settlement in 2013 and the legacy tax benefits in both years nongaap diluted eps of 365 in 2013 was 066 higher than in the same period of the prior year

in the us revenue of 4098 million in 2013 increased 502 million and reflected growth across all three lobs international revenue of 5033 million in 2013 was 194 million higher than in 2012 

global rda revenue which comprised 58 of total external ma revenue in both 2013 and 2012 increased 388 million over the prior year period the growth was primarily due to increased sales of the creditview product and solid growth from other data and analytic products as well as general market price increases 

global ers revenue in 2013 increased 199 million over 2012 primarily due to revenue from the sale and implementation of regulatory and compliance software to various financial institutions this growth is primarily due to demand for solutions to comply with an increasingly complex regulatory environment in the banking industry revenue in ers is subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of revenue in a relatively small number of engagements 

revenue from ps which included approximately 2 million in revenue from the acquisition of amba increased 109 million compared to 2012 reflecting growth in revenue from copal being partially offset by softness in the fstc reporting unit this growth in revenue from copal reflects further penetration into the market for outsourced research and analytical services if the fstc reporting unit does not achieve its financial forecast it could result in a goodwill impairment charge in future quarters 

operating and sga expenses in 2013 increased 421 million compared to 2012 reflecting both higher compensation and noncompensation costs of approximately 29 million and 13 million respectively the increase in compensation costs reflects higher headcount to support business growth coupled with annual compensation increases as well as higher headcount in support areas for which the costs are allocated to each segment based on a revenuesplit methodology the increase in noncompensation expenses is primarily due to higher contingent consideration costs of approximately 7 million relating to the acquisition of copal and higher professional service fees of approximately 7 million related to product delivery

the company’s etr was 317 in 2012 up slightly from 312 in 2011 the increase was primarily due to the reversal of utps in the prior year resulting from a foreign tax ruling as well as benefits from the settlement of state tax audits in 2011 these items were partially offset by the favorable impact of tax planning initiatives in 2012

moody’s analytics 

the table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results followed by further insight and commentary 

 



the following is a discussion of external ma revenue and operating expenses 

global ma revenue increased 1317 million compared to 2011 with 60 of the growth generated internationally and included revenue from copal and bh which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 recurring revenue comprised 77 of total ma revenue in 2012 compared to 80 in 2011 

in the us revenue of 3596 million in 2012 increased 616 million and reflected growth across all three lobs international revenue of 4839 million in 2012 was 701 million higher than in 2011 and reflected growth across all lobs 

global rda revenue which comprised 58 and 64 of ma external revenue in 2012 and 2011 respectively increased 393 million in 2012 the growth was primarily due to increased sales of credit research via the creditview product and solid growth from other data and analytic products global ers revenue in 2012 increased 465 million over 2011 due to revenue from the acquisition of bh in the fourth quarter of 2011 coupled with good growth in the base business revenue from the ps lob increased 459 million compared to 2011 with substantially all of the growth reflecting the acquisition of copal in the fourth quarter of 2011 revenue in the ers and ps lobs are subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of revenue in a relatively small number of engagements 

operating and sga expenses in 2012 increased 1000 million compared to 2011 reflecting both higher compensation and noncompensation costs of approximately 82 million and 18 million respectively the increase in compensation costs reflects an increase in headcount relating to the acquisitions of copal and bh in the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as to support business growth coupled with annual merit increases the increase in noncompensation costs reflects expenses related to the acquisitions of copal and bh which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as increases in certain variable costs that are correlated with business growth 

 

 depreciation and amortization of 493 million in 2012 increased 113 million from 2011 reflecting higher amortization related to intangible assets acquired as part of the fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions of copal and bh 

the goodwill impairment charge of 122 million relates to the fstc reporting unit within ma this impairment resulted from lower than expected projected growth for this reporting unit as many individuals and global financial institutions have reduced spending on training and certification services amidst macroeconomic uncertainties in north america and emea 

adjusted operating income was 1924 million in 2012 including intersegment revenue and expenses and increased 272 million compared to 2011 adjusted operating margin for 2012 was 225 compared to 229 in 2011 operating income of 1309 million in 2012 which includes intersegment revenue and expenses increased 37 million compared to 2011 and resulted in an operating margin of 153 a decline of 230bps from the prior year reflecting the aforementioned increase in depreciation and amortization and goodwill impairment charge being partially offset by strong total revenue growth 

market risk 

foreign exchange risk 

moody’s maintains a presence in 30 countries outside the us in 2013 approximately 48 and 59 of the company’s revenue and expenses respectively were in currencies other than the us dollar principally in the gbp and the euro as such the company is exposed to market risk from changes in fx rates as of december 31 2013 approximately 55 of moody’s assets were located outside the us making the company susceptible to fluctuations in fx rates the effects of translating assets and liabilities of nonus operations with nonus functional currencies to the us dollar are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment account in the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity deficit 

the effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency are charged to other nonoperating income expense net in the company’s consolidated statements of operations accordingly the company enters into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency if foreign currencies in the company’s foreign exchange forward portfolio were to devalue 10 compared to the us dollar there would be an approximate 7 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts additionally if foreign currencies in the company’s foreign exchange forward portfolio were to devalue 10 compared to the euro there would be an approximate 4 million favorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts the change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by fx revaluation gains or losses in future earnings on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency additional information on the company’s forward contracts can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k 

additionally the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure related to nonus dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates any change in the fair value of these hedges that is the result of ineffectiveness would be recognized immediately in other nonoperating expense income in the company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 all gains and losses on these derivatives designated as net investment hedges were recognized in oci if all foreign currencies in the company’s net investment hedge portfolio were to appreciate 10 compared to the us dollar there would be an approximate 29 million unfavorable impact to the currency translation adjustment component of aoci 

moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of 21063 million at december 31 2013 consisted of approximately 881 million denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as such a decrease in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar particularly the euro and gbp could reduce the reported amount of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

credit and interest rate risk 

the company’s interest rate risk management objective is to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing this objective

 moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in highquality investmentgrade securities within and outside the us with maturities of three months or less when purchased the company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of highgrade commercial paper and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer shortterm investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit

interest expense net 

the following table summarizes the components of interest as presented in the consolidated statements of operations 

 

  

  

 the company’s longterm debt including the current portion is recorded at cost except for the series 20051 notes which is carried at cost adjusted for the fair value of an interest rate swap used to hedge the fair value of the note the fair value and carrying value of the company’s longterm debt as of december 31 2013 and 2012 is as follows 

 

  

  

 the fair value of the longterm debt is estimated using discounted cash flows based on prevailing interest rates available to the company for borrowings with similar maturities 

management may consider pursuing additional longterm financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations share repurchases and other strategic opportunities which would result in higher financing costs 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2013 moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where moody’s is the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such moody’s is not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships

 nongaap financial measures 

in addition to its reported results moody’s has included in this mda certain adjusted results that the sec defines as “nongaap financial measures” management believes that such nongaap financial measures when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the company’s performance facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking these nongaap measures as defined by the company are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies furthermore these nongaap measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other gaap measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the company below are brief descriptions of the company’s nongaap financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the nongaap measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure 

adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin  

the company presents adjusted operating income because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating performance of moody’s measuring the company’s ability to service debt fund capital expenditures and expand its business adjusted operating income excludes depreciation and amortization as well as goodwill impairment charges because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring productive assets including goodwill companies also have different methods of depreciating and amortizing productive assets as well as different methods of valuing goodwill management 

 

 believes that the exclusion of certain items detailed in the reconciliation below allows for a more meaningful comparison of the company’s operating results from period to period and across companies below is a reconciliation of the company’s operating income and operating margin to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin 

 

 nongaap diluted eps 

the company presents this nongaap measure to exclude the impact of litigation settlements legacy tax matters and restructuring items to allow for a more meaningful comparison of moody’s diluted earnings per share from period to period the legacy tax items are specific to the company resulting from the 2000 distribution the restructuring items relate to the certain costs incurred in connection with the 2007 restructuring plan and the 2009 restructuring plan the impact of litigation settlement relates to the settlement of two legal matters in the first quarter of 2013 which are more fully discussed in the “contingences” section of this mda below is a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable us gaap amount 

 

 free cash flow 

the company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital additions management believes that free cash flow is a useful metric in assessing the company’s cash flows to service debt pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases management deems capital expenditures essential to the company’s product and service innovations and maintenance of moody’s operational capabilities accordingly capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of moody’s cash flow below is a reconciliation of the company’s net cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow 

 

 2014 outlook 

moody’s outlook for 2014 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates corporate profitability and business investment spending merger and acquisition activity consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued there is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at endofquarter exchange rates

 prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and the types of securities or other obligations outstanding beginning in mid2007 there was a severe market disruption and a global decline in issuance activity for some significant asset classes despite the market disruption and subsequent weak economic performance and recoveries in the advanced economies moody’s believes that the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued global growth of fixedincome markets including the market for related financial information such as credit opinions data analytics and related services 

moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 since the global financial crisis began in mid2007 there has been slow progress in remediating structural issues and the economic recoveries from the 2008 – 2009 recession in the advanced economies has been weak adverse headwinds impacting the pace of global trade growth and volatile capital market flows have caused economic activity to slow across both advanced and emerging economies however gradual strengthening in global economic growth is expected to occur over the coming years as the us economy continues to improve and the euro crisis is managed 

moody’s is well positioned to benefit from a longterm recovery in global credit market activity and a more informed use of credit ratings research and related analytical products in an environment of renewed attention to risk analysis and risk management moody’s expects that these developments will support continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions research data and risk management tools and services an expectation of recoverydriven growth in capital market activity supported by initiatives to increase market share leverage pricing opportunities capture disintermediation activity in developed and developing markets and develop additional data research and rating products represent key growth drivers for moody’s 

growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates business investment spending corporate refunding needs merger and acquisition activity and consumer borrowing and securitization rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the dollarequivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets mis’s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and the prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decision process however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings and other areas partially mitigate mis’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global capital markets furthermore the strong growth trend seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid1990’s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010 then stabilization in 2011 in 2012 moody’s has seen revenue growth from this market despite significant declines from peak market levels moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global credit markets and will provide opportunities for longer term revenue growth moody’s will continue to monitor this market and adapt to meet the changing needs of its participants 

longer term growth in global fixedincome markets is also attributable to a number of forces and trends such as advances in information technology and disintermediation of financial systems the pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell which in the absence of the appropriate technology may not be easily obtainable this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of developed capital markets and a number of new capital markets as technology provides for wider access to worldwide markets it also results in a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk data analytics and related services additionally information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support moody’s continued expansion in developing markets 

  

 an ongoing trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets recent credit market disruptions which began in mid2007 initially slowed the trend of disintermediation globally but moody’s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems in fact disintermediation has accelerated in some markets over the past year because of the low interest rate environment and ongoing bank deleveraging which has encouraged a number of corporations and other entities to seek alternative funding in bond markets while in key emerging markets strong economic growth is out pacing their internal banking system capacity thus disintermediation is expected to accelerate in the longerterm with moody’s continuing to target investment and resources to growing international markets where disintermediation and bond issuance should remain more robust 

in response to the credit market disruptions ongoing volatility in the global capital markets and to address a wide range of new regulatory requirements financial institutions are investing in people processes and systems to enhance risk management and compliance functions regulations such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act basel ii basel iii solvency ii and others may stimulate demand for ma products financial institutions are also investing in advanced qualitative and quantitative tools and services to support their management of complex balance sheets and diverse portfolios ma offers a suite of risk management products and services to address these needs including but not limited to risk management software economic analysis training and professional services 

legislative bodies and regulators in the us europe and selective other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of cras which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of mis or increased costs of doing business for mis therefore in order to broaden the potential for expansion of nonratings services moody’s reorganized in january 2008 into two distinct businesses mis consisting solely of the ratings business and ma ma conducts all nonratings activities including the sale of credit research produced by mis and the production and sale of other economic and creditrelated products and services the reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by ma into activities which may have otherwise been restricted for mis due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities 

moody’s operations are subject to various risks as more fully described in part i item 1a “risk factors” inherent in conducting business internationally such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources however the formation of for example a new governmentsponsored regional or global rating agency would pose a risk to mis’s growth prospects management believes that this risk compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry is relatively low because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required with uncertainty about the likelihood of financial success for the entity 

competition 

the mis business competes with other cras and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research many users of mis’s ratings also have inhouse credit research capabilities mis’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s ratings services sp a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp while in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp mis’s competitors include fitch ratings dominion bond rating service ltd am best company inc japan credit rating agency ltd kroll bond rating agency inc morningstar inc and eganjones ratings company in europe examples of competitors include euler hermes rating feri eurorating creditreform rating psr rating icap group and companhia portuguesa de rating there are additional competitors in other regions and countries for example in china where moody’s operates through a joint venture these competitors include china lianhe credit rating co ltd shanghai brilliance credit rating  investors service co ltd dagong global credit rating co ltd and pengyuan credit rating co ltd 

ma competes broadly in the financial information industry against diversified competitors such as thomson reuters bloomberg sp capital iq fitch solutions dun  bradstreet ibm wolters kluwer sungard sas fiserv msci and markit group among others ma’s main competitors within rda include sp capital iq creditsights thomson reuters intex ihs global insight blackrock solutions factset and other smaller boutique providers of fixed income analytics valuations economic data and research in ers ma faces competition from both large software providers such as ibm algorithmics sungard sas oracle turaz oliver wyman verisk and vari

moody’s strategy 

moody’s corporate strategy is to be the world’s most respected authority servicing financial risksensitive markets the key aspects to implement this strategy are to 

 

  

  

 moody’s will make investments to defend and enhance its core businesses in an attempt to position the company to fully capture market opportunities resulting from global debt capital market expansion and increased business investment spending moody’s will also make strategic investments to achieve scale in attractive financial information markets move into attractive product and service adjacencies where the company can leverage its brand extend its thought leadership and expand its geographic presence in high growth emerging markets 

to broaden the company’s potential ma provides a wide range of products and services capabilities to enable financial institutions to better manage risk as such ma adds to the company’s value proposition in three ways first ma’s subscription businesses provide a significant base of recurring revenue to offset cyclicality in ratings issuance volumes that can introduce volatility to mis revenues second ma products and services such as financial training and advisory services on risk management best practices provide opportunities for entry into emerging markets before debt capital markets fully develop and present growth opportunities for the ratings business finally ma’s integrated risk management software platform embeds moody’s solutions deep into the technology infrastructure of banks and insurance companies worldwide 

moody’s invests in initiatives to implement the company’s strategy including internallyled organic development and targeted acquisitions example initiatives include 

 

  

  

  

  

 regulation 

mis and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the us and in other countries including by state and local authorities thus existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company’s operations and the markets for securities that it rates additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered each of the existing adopted proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which moody’s operates 

in the eu in 2009 the european parliament passed a new regulation “cra1” that establishes an oversight regime for the cra industry in the european union the framework for the eu regulation requires the registration formal regulation and periodic inspection of cras operating in the eu the eu regulation also sets out specific requirements for the use of ratings that are produced outside of the eu and are used for regulatory purposes in the eu among these is a requirement for the relevant competent authority in the eu and the competent authority of the noneu jurisdiction where that rating has been produced to enter into a cooperation agreement containing provisions related to the exchange of information and the coordination of supervisory activities cra1 became fully effective in september 2010 mis applied for registration in august 2010 and was granted registration in october 2011 in addition through a new regulatory instrument cra2 the european securities and markets authority was established in january 2011 and has had direct supervisory responsibility for the registered cra industry in the eu since july 2011 

  

 finally in november 2011 the european commission issued proposed amendments to its existing regulations generally referred to as cra3 after a year of dialogue among political institutions regulatory authorities and market participants the european parliament voted on and adopted cra3 in january 2013 a few additional steps remain in the legislative process before cra3 is finalized it is expected that cra3 will become effective in the second half of 2013 as adopted the revised regulations among other things would 

 

  

  

  

  

 certain of the provisions of cra3 will be subject to esma rulemaking and it is expected that process will happen within the year most of cra3 however will become effective 20 days after the text’s official publication 

in december 2012 the staff of the sec’s trading and markets division published a “report to congress on assigned credit ratings” the delivery of this report commonly referred to as the franken amendment study discharged one of the sec’s obligations under the financial reform act regarding the cra industry in the report the sec staff identified several potential courses of action without endorsing any of them and noted that any changes through sec rulemaking would require additional study of relevant information in this respect the sec recommended that a roundtable be convened so that proponents and critics of the various options could discuss the report and its findings the timing regarding this roundtable and the remainder of the sec’s rulemaking under the financial reform act remains uncertain other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future in addition in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which mis operates the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of the company cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

 us laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry are rapidly evolving and may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us these regulations are complex rapidly evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time some of the more prominent developments are discussed below or under the section entitled “regulation” in part 1 item 1 of this form 10k these new laws and regulations may cause or result in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 two key pieces of legislation affecting these changes are the reform act and the financial reform act under the reform act which seeks to encourage increased competition among rating agencies the sec has direct jurisdiction over credit rating agencies that seek nrsro status and has the authority to inspect their operations the financial reform act authorizes the adoption of enhanced oversight standards for credit rating agencies and also provides for new pleading standards and enhanced liability as a result credit rating agencies may be subject to a greater number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities and may increase the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by moody’s 

these new laws and regulations and any future rulemaking could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs which moody’s may be unable to pass through to customers in addition there may be greater uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of new laws and regulations as new laws and regulations are adopted the company may be required to incur significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines penalties or other sanctions legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be increased uncertainty over and exposure to liability given the comparatively recent adoption and the number of additional reforms proposed it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of these new and proposed legislative and regulatory requirements on moody’s business and its customers’ businesses these developments may affect mis’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which mis’s ratings are developed assigned and communicated affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate impact the demand for mis’s ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business including by restricting or mandating business models for rating agencies further speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may affect moody’s stock price although these recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally they may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on moody’s operations profitability competitiveness demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized 

financial reforms outside the us affecting the credit rating industry may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

in addition to the extensive and evolving us laws and regulations governing the industry foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings in particular the eu has been active in adopting a new regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the eu and has sought to introduce a common eu regulatory approach to oversight of credit rating agencies the eu has established conditions for the issuance of credit ratings rules on the organization and conduct of credit rating agencies—including restrictions on certain activities deemed to create a conflict of interest—and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments esma which became fully operational in july 2011 now has direct supervisory authority for credit rating agencies in the eu 

in january 2013 the european parliament adopted amendments to its existing cra regulations generally referred to as cra3 a few additional steps remain in the legislative process before cra3 is finalized it is expected that cra3 will become effective in the second half of 2013 as adopted the revised regulations among other things would i impose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers ii require member states to adopt laws imposing liability on cras for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations iii impose mandatory rotation requirements on cras hired by issuers of securities for ratings on resecuritizations which may limit the number of years a cra can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer iv impose restrictions on credit rating agencies or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed and v impose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services 

  

 eu financial reforms could have a significant negative effect on moody’s operations and profitability ability to compete or the markets for its products and services including in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict in particular exposure to increased liability under future eu regulation may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact moody’s results of operations in addition compliance with the amended eu regulations may increase costs of operations 

further moody’s believes there is still potential for additional rulemaking by the eu and other jurisdictions that can significantly impact operations or the markets for moody’s products and services such as regulations affecting the need for debt securities to be rated establishment of criteria for credit ratings or limiting the entities authorized to provide credit ratings moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations however the effect that they have on moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant financial reforms in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on the moody’s business operating results and financial conditions 

exposure to litigation related to moody’s rating opinions 

moody’s faces exposure to litigation related to its ratings actions as well as other business practices as a result of difficult economic times and turbulent markets over the last several years the market value of creditdependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased this has led to a significant increase in the number of legal proceedings that moody’s is facing including class actions and other litigation government investigations and inquiries concerning events in the us subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly over the last several years legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the us in addition new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time furthermore to the extent that moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals from the various litigation at an early stage and matters proceed to trial as are two siv related litigations filed against the subsidiaries of moody’s in the southern district of new york the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by moody’s increase substantially as does the risk of an adverse outcome see “contingencies” for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that we currently face due to the number of these proceedings and significant amount of damages sought there is a risk that moody’s will be subject to judgments settlements fines penalties or other adverse results that could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

legal economic and regulatory risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions 

moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the company operates may have an impact on business for example economic uncertainty in the eurozone or in southeast asia could affect the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas in addition operations abroad expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 additionally moody’s is subject to complex us and foreign laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other antibribery and anticorruption laws although the company has implemented internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices such policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such policies and the law any determination that the company has violated antibribery or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on moody’s financial conditions compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on moody’s reputation its ability to attract and retain employees its business operating results and financial conditions 

moody’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located including its headquarters in new york city and offices in major cities worldwide this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business whether due to human error natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism or war or otherwise moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of major operating systems may not be successful the company in a number of instances relies on third party providers to provide essential services while the company believes that such third parties are reliable the company has less control over the performance of such providers the company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations their ability to service and interact with moody’s clients and customers may suffer a disruption to moody’s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations and financial conditions 

risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information 

moody’s prominence in the global marketplace makes it more likely that the company will be targeted for cyberattacks and other cybersecurity risks in particular the company may be targeted in response to its ratings of sovereign debt the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks protective measures that moody’s takes may be circumvented or insufficient and the company’s networks and those of third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks including unauthorized access to proprietary information and sensitive or confidential information denialofservice attacks computer viruses and other security concerns such as attacks from cyber criminals confidential and other information may be disclosed to an unauthorized third party as a result of inappropriate access to information technology systems and assets or may be insufficiently protected when transferred to an authorized recipient a successful cyberattack could cause interruptions or malfunctions and compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the company’s web sites applications or data breaches of security could also expose the company its customers and others to risks of loss such attacks could have regulatory and reputational consequences as well as affect client relationships while we continue to focus on mitigating our vulnerability to cyber risks and protect our infrastructure against security breaches security measures against such attacks are costly and may prove inadequate as a result of such attacks the company may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company a successful cyberattack or other cybersecurity concern may have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial conditions 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets 

moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the world financial markets credit market disruptions together with the persistent economic slowdown and uncertainty have negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings although access to credit markets has improved in the us a longterm continuation of difficult economic conditions uncertainty regarding the us debt ceiling or a worsening of the sovereign debt crisis in europe is likely to have an adverse impact on the business future debt issuances could be negatively affected by a sharp increase in longterm interest rates or factors which cause instability or volatility in the global capital markets such as significant regulatory political or economic events the use of alternative sources of credit including financial institutions and government sources and defaults of significant issuers changes in the markets for such securities and in the role and regulation of rating agencies may materially adversely affect the company 

furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional credit rating agencies such as mis a majority of mis’s revenue is transactionbased and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets accordingly any market volatility or conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ will 

  

 ingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollarequivalent volume of debt issuances for which mis provides ratings services and thereby have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings as such no assurance can be given as to the amount of revenues that may be derived therefrom 

the timing nature extent and sustainability of any recovery in the credit and other financial markets remains uncertain and a prolonged period of market decline or weakness could have a material adverse effect on the business moody’s initiatives to reduce costs may not be sufficient and further cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the near term due in part to rent technology compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further the costreduction initiatives undertaken to date could make it difficult for the company to rapidly expand operations to accommodate any unexpected increase in the credit markets and demand for ratings volatility in the financial markets to include changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial conditions 

increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

there is intense price competition in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service as well as increased competition from nonnrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors at the same time bankruptcies and consolidation of customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of customers while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and service it may lose market share if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors in addition one of the central goals of the reform act was to encourage competition among rating agencies the formation of additional nrsros may increase pricing as well as other competitive pressures if moody’s is unable to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its services and products its business operating results and financial condition may experience a material adverse effect 

exposure to reputational and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be significantly impacted factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities the timing and nature of changes in ratings a major compliance failure negative publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings regulators and legislative bodies including adverse publicity as to the ratings process and its implementation with respect to one or more securities operational errors whether by moody’s or a moody’s competitor could also harm the reputation of the credit rating industry damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on moody’s business operating results and financial condition 

introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies 

the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are highly competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share our competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources brand recognition market experience and technological expertise as well as smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by moody’s customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and its growth prospects in addition moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by limitations of its information technologies that fail to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors if moody’s is unable to compete successfully there may be a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

significant amount of intangible assets 

at december 31 2012 moody’s had 6371 million of goodwill and 2265 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet approximately 99 of these intangibles reside in the ma business and are allocated to the four reporting units within ma rda ers financial services training and certifications and copal failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in an asset impairment charge which would result in a noncash charge to operating expenses goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists is difficult as a result of increased uncertainty and current market dynamics and requires significant management estimates and judgment an asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition during the fourth quarter of 2012 the company recognized a 122 million goodwill impairment charge related to its fstc reporting unit which is more fully

possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures 

moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting retaining and motivating highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis we are highly dependent on the continued services of raymond w mcdaniel jr our president and chief executive officer and other senior officers and key employees the loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss could have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition 

moody’s acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results 

moody’s has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow the company such transactions present significant challenges and risks the market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive especially in light of industry consolidation which may affect our ability to complete such transactions if such transactions are completed they may not realize the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions for instance the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures the company may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management’s focus from other business operations the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected as a result the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition 

the trading price of moody’s stock could be affected by third party actions 

ownership of moody’s stock is highly concentrated with a majority of shares held by a few institutional stockholders due to this concentrated stockholder base the trading price of moody’s stock could be affected considerably by actions of significant stockholders to increase or decrease their positions in moody’s stock as a result the actions of these institutional stockholders could create high stock volatility

this mda contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” commencing on page 60 and item 1a “risk factors” commencing on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties risks and other factors associated with these statements 

the company 

moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings ii credit capital markets and economic related research data and analytical tools iii software solutions and related risk management services iv quantitative credit risk measures financial services training and certification services and v outsourced research and analytical services to institutional customers moody’s has two reportable segments mis and ma 

mis the credit rating agency publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors 

the ma segment which includes all of the company’s nonrating commercial activities develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets within its rda business ma distributes research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies and commentary on topical creditrelated events the rda business also produces economic research as well as data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores within its ers business formerly referred to as rms ma provides software solutions as well as related risk management services the ps business provides outsourced research and analytical services along with financial training and certification programs

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets pension and other retirement benefits utbs and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable 

pursuant to the guidance of asu 200913 when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available third party evidence if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 

the company’s products and services will generally continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under asu 200913 the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control in instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit 

  

 the company determines whether its selling price in a multielement transaction meets the vsoe criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately in instances where the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range or only having a limited sales history the company attempts to establish tpe for deliverables the company determines whether tpe exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers however due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing possible differences in the company’s market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the company may contain a significant level of differentiation andor customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained the company generally is unable to reliably determine tpe based on the selling price hierarchy established by asu 200913 when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe the company will establish an esp esp is the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis the company establishes its best estimate of esp considering internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives standalone sales prices of similar products percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service and customer segment and geography additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend the company reviews its determination of vsoe tpe and esp on an annual basis or more frequently as needed 

in the mis segment revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed generally one year in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities derivatives international residential mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities which ranged from two to 52 years at december 31 2012 at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately 82 million 79 million and 76 million respectively 

multiple element revenue arrangements in the mis segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees the company generally uses esp in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for initial ratings 

mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 accounts receivable included approximately 22 million 24 million and 25 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings furthermore for certain annual monitoring services fees are not invoiced until the end of the monitoring period however revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period 

in the ma segment products and services offered by the company include software licenses and related maintenance subscriptions and professional services revenue from subscription based products such as research and data subscriptions and certain softwarebased credit risk management subscription products is recognized ratably over the related subscription period which is principally one year revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period revenue from services rendered within the professional services line of business is generally recognized as the services are performed if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs a large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of november december and january 

products and services offered within the ma segment are sold either standalone or together in various combinations in instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and nonsoftware deliverables revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition previously described 

if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using vsoe in the instances where the company is not able to determine vsoe for all of the deliverables of an arrangement the company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its vsoe and the residual revenue to the delivered elements if the company is unable to determine vsoe for an undelivered element the company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the company has delivered all of the elements or when vsoe has been determined for the undelivered elements 

  

 accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue based on historical experience and current conditions such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance billing adjustments and uncollectible account writeoffs are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the company’s consolidated results of operations 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in the “contingencies” section of this “mda” commencing on page 58 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities additionally for legal defense costs insured by the company’s whollyowned insurance entity the company records liabilities for these items based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid andor total projected costs to be incurred to defend a claim over the anticipated duration of a matter 

for claims litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability is expected to be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range in other instances because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation regulatory governmental investigations and inquiries enforcement and similar matters and contingencies particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also cannot predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition however in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time 

the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary insures the company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation employment practices litigation employee medical claims and terrorism for which the claims are not material to the company in addition for claim years 2008 and 2009 the insurance subsidiary insured the company for defense costs related to professional liability claims for matters insured by the company’s insurance subsidiary moody’s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion the company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management’s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates the cheyne siv and rhinebridge siv matters more fully discussed in the “contingencies” section of this mda are both cases from the 20082009 claims period and accordingly the defense cost for these matters are insured by the company’s insurance subsidiary defense costs for matters not selfinsured by the company’s whollyowned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided 

for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic 740 of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

  

 goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

moody’s annually evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment historically this was performed as of november 30 or more frequently if impairment indicators arose in accordance with asc topic 350 in the second quarter of 2012 the company changed the date of its annual assessment of goodwill impairment to july 31 of each year this is a change in method of applying an accounting principle which management believes is a preferable alternative as the new date of the assessment is more closely aligned with the company’s annual strategic planning process the change in the assessment date does not delay accelerate or avoid a potential impairment charge the company has determined that it is impracticable to objectively determine projected cash flows and related valuation estimates that would have been used as of each july 31 of prior reporting periods without the use of hindsight as such the company has prospectively applied the change in annual goodwill impairment testing date beginning in the second quarter of 2012 

at july 31 2012 the company had five primary reporting units one in mis that encompasses all of moody’s ratings operations and four reporting units within ma rda ers fstc and copal the rda reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools the ers reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software and maintenance and related implementation services in the first quarter of 2012 a division formerly in the rda reporting unit which provided various financial modeling services was transferred to the ers reporting unit additionally in the second quarter of 2012 the csi reporting unit which consisted of all operations relating to csi which was acquired in in november 2010 was integrated into ma’s training reporting unit to form the fstc reporting unit the new fstc reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and certification services in the fourth quarter of 2011 the company acquired copal which is deemed to be separate reporting unit at december 31 2012 also in december 2011 the company acquired bh which is part of the ers reporting unit 

in 2011 the fasb issued an asu which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount before proceeding with a quantitative assessment the company has adopted the provisions of this asu as of december 31 2011 and accordingly the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a threestep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level in the first step the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount if a determination is made that based on the qualitative factors an impairment does not exist the company is not required to perform further testing if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company must perform a third step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude on impairment using only a qualitative approach the company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and appropriate comparable market metrics the company bases its fair value estimates on reasonable assumptions however as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from these estimates in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit at the date when an acquisition is integrated into one of the established reporting units and is based on which reporting unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 

at july 31 2012 the company determined based on actual and forecasted operating results and certain other macroeconomic uncertainties that there were indicators that the fair value of the fstc reporting unit may potentially be less than its carrying amount this fact coupled with the aforementioned integration of csi with ma’s other training businesses the transfer of a division from the rda reporting unit to the ers reporting unit and the acquisition of bh after the november 30 2011 goodwill impairment analysis date resulted in the company performing a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment on the rda ers and fstc reporting units at july 31 2012 based on this assessment the company concluded that the goodwill related to these reporting units was not impaired at july 31 2012 as the fair value for these reporting units was in excess of their carrying values 

  

 the company performed a qualitative analysis on its mis and copal reporting units at july 31 2012 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying amounts the most significant estimates in these qualitative assessments were projected results for each reporting unit and the weighted average cost of capital wacc the qualitative assessment also considered the impact of various macroeconomic conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit that could impact future cash flows in addition to analyzing macroeconomic factors that could potentially impact the cash flows of the reporting units the company analyzed the growth rates and the wacc for the mis reporting unit noting that changes in the assumptions from those used for the reporting unit’s last quantitative assessment as of november 30 2010 were favorable to the reporting unit’s valuation for the copal reporting unit the company believes its fair value approximates the purchase price due to the proximity of the purchase date to the date of the goodwill impairment assessment and the fact that copal is meeting its financial targets established at the time of the acquisition based upon the aforementioned qualitative assessment for mis and copal the company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the mis and copal reporting units was less than its carrying amount 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 based on declines in cash flow projections for the fstc reporting unit which reflected slower than anticipated growth in training and certification spending for individuals and global financial institutions the company determined that there were indicators that the fair value of the fstc reporting unit may potentially be less than its carrying amount the decline in projected cash flows for the fstc reporting unit from the july 31 2012 impairment assessment reflects many individuals and global financial institutions scaling back expenditures for training and certification services amidst current macroeconomic uncertainties in the north america and emea regions accordingly the company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment on this reporting unit as of december 31 2012 this test resulted in the carrying value of the fstc reporting unit being less than its fair value as a result the company performed step three of the goodwill impairment evaluation and determined the implied fair value of the fstc reporting unit’s goodwill by calculating the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit this calculation resulted in the carrying value of the fstc reporting unit’s goodwill exceeding its fair value resulting in an impairment charge of 122 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 

sensitivity analyses and key assumptions for deriving the fair value of a reporting unit 

the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december 31 2012 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units for the rda and ers reporting units the fair value in the table below was calculated as of july 31 2012 as described above there was a quantitative assessment performed on the fstc reporting unit as of december 31 2012 and accordingly the fair value in the table below for this reporting unit was calculated as of december 31 2012 for the mis reporting unit the fair value was calculated as of november 30 2010 as there have been no qualitative indicators that have resulted in the company performing a quantitative test subsequent to this date the copal reporting unit’s fair value is deemed to be its purchase price 

 

  

 as can be seen from the table above the reporting unit most at risk for potential impairment is the fstc reporting unit and failure to meet its financial projections could result in further goodwill impairment this business is in part sensitive to the staffing levels and profitability of the global financial services industry particularly in canada and emea 

the following is a discussion regarding the company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units as of the date of each reporting unit’s last quantitative test december 31 2012 for fstc july 31 2012 for rda and ers november 30 2010 for mis this discussion excludes copal which has not yet been subject to a full quantitative impairment analysis as of december 31 2012 due to the timing of the acquisition of this entity 

  

 the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples the dcf analysis requires significant judgments regarding the derivation of fair value including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments 

the sensitivity analyses on the wacc and future cash flow assumptions described below are as of the date of the last quantitative assessment for each reporting unit the fstc reporting unit is excluded from these sensitivity analyses as there was a goodwill impairment charge recorded for this reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2012 the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology which requires significant management judgment 

 

  

 amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in conjunction with the assessment of goodwill impairment at july 31 2012 the company reviewed the recoverability of certain customer lists within its fstc reporting unit this review resulted in an impairment of approximately 1 million in the third quarter of 2012 which is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the company’s consolidated statement of operations the company again reviewed the recoverability of these customer lists in the fourth quarter of 2012 in conjunction with the quantitative goodwill impairment test performed at december 31 2012 based on this assessment there was no further impairment of the customer lists in the fourth quarter of 2012 for all other intangible assets there were no such events or changes during 2012 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the company’s reporting units may not be recoverable this determination was made based on improving market conditions for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides and an assessment of projected cash flows for all reporting units additionally there were no events or circumstances during 2012 that would indicate the need for an adjustment of the remaining useful lives of these amortizable intangible assets 

pension and other retirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

   

  the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31 2012 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s retirement plans 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise excluding differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets the company amortizes as a component of annual pension expense total outstanding gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets for moody’s retirement plans the total losses as of december 31 2012 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 1496 million and moody’s expects to recognize a net periodic benefit expense of 115 million in 2013 related to the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded us pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under asc topic 715 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2012 the company has an unrecognized asset gain of 10 million of which 08 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2014 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2013 operating income these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2013 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s retirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  weighted average discount rates of 382 and 355 for pension plans and other retirement plans respectively 

a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2013 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be 359 million in 2013 compared with 318 million in 2012 the expected expense increase in 2013 reflects the effects of higher benefit obligations primarily due to lower discount rate assumptions lower expected return on plan assets due to lower longterm rate of return assumption and higher amortization of actuarial losses 

stockbased compensation 

the company records compensation expense for all sharebased payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans stock options and restricted stock the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 

  

 an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2012 dollars in millions 

 

 income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

for utps asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

for certain of its nonus subsidiaries the company has deemed the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations accordingly the company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings it is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated dividend distributions from nonus subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s 

operating segments 

the company is organized into three operating segments i mis ii ma and iii an immaterial operating segment that provides fixed income pricing services in the asiapacific region the aforementioned immaterial operating segment has been aggregated with the ma operating segment based on the fact that it has similar economic characteristics to ma accordingly the company reports in two reportable segments mis and ma the mis segment is comprised of all of the company’s ratings activities all of moody’s other nonrating commercial activities are included in the ma segment 

the mis segment consists of four lines of business—corporate finance structured finance financial institutions and public project and infrastructure finance—that generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide 

the ma segment which includes all of the company’s nonrating commercial activities develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets the ma segment 

  

 consists of three lines of business – rda ers formerly rms and ps additionally in the first quarter of 2012 a division within the ps lob that provides various financial modeling services was transferred to the ers lob accordingly the prior year revenue by lob for ma has been reclassified to reflect this transfer 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 subsidiaries of the company acquired copal and bh copal is an outsourced research and consulting business bh is a provider of insurance risk management tools bh and copal are part of the ma segment and their revenues are included in the ers and ps lobs within ma respectively 

the following is a discussion of the results of operations of these segments including the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content data and products developed by mis the discussion also includes intersegment fees charged to mis from ma for the use of certain ma products and services in mis’s ratings process these fees charged by ma are generally equal to the costs incurred by ma to provide these products and services overhead charges and corporate expenses which exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment additionally overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company which benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a revenuesplit methodology overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy information technology and support staff such as finance human resources and information technology beginning on january 1 2012 the company refined its methodology for allocating certain overhead departments to its segments to better align the costs allocated based on each segment’s usage of the overhead service the refined methodology is reflected in the segment results for the year ended december 31 2012 and accordingly the segment results for the prior year comparative periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation

 moody’s corporation 

the table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results followed by further insight and commentary 

 

  

 the table below shows moody’s global staffing by geographic area 

 

  

 global revenue of 27303 million in 2012 increased 4496 million compared to 2011 reflecting strong growth in both segments the increase in ratings revenue compared to 2011 reflects growth across all ratings lobs most notably in cfg the growth in ma reflects higher revenue across all lobs and includes revenue from copal and bh which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 transaction revenue accounted for 50 and 46 of global mco revenue in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

us revenue of 14641 million increased 2871 million over 2011 primarily reflecting growth across all ratings lobs most notably in cfg coupled with growth in all lobs within ma also contributing to the growth were changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases in the mis segment 

nonus revenue increased 1625 million over 2011 reflecting strong growth in ps and ers revenue within ma due to the acquisitions of copal and bh in the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as higher mis revenue from rating investmentgrade and speculativegrade corporate debt changes in fx translation rates had an approximate 45 million unfavorable impact on nonus revenue in 2012 

  

 operating expenses were 7950 million in 2012 an increase of 1115 million from 2011 and reflected an increase in both compensation and noncompensation costs the increase in compensation costs of approximately 96 million reflects higher salaries and related employee benefits resulting from increases in headcount which includes the fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions of copal and bh as well as higher headcount in both the mis and ma base business also contributing to the increase in salaries and related employee benefits was the impact of annual merit increases additionally the increase in compensation expense is due to higher incentive compensation reflecting greater achievement against fullyear targeted results compared to achievement in the prior year period the increase in noncompensation costs of approximately 16 million is primarily due to higher costs to support investment in it infrastructure 

sga expenses of 7522 million in 2012 increased 1226 million from 2011 and reflected increases in both compensation and noncompensation expenses compensation costs increased approximately 73 million primarily due to higher salaries and related employee benefits which reflects annual merit increases and headcount growth in sales personnel within ma as well as in the support areas of compliance and it also the growth in compensation expenses reflects a fullyear of costs for copal and bh which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 additionally the increase in compensation expense is due to higher incentive compensation reflecting greater achievement against fullyear targeted results compared to achievement in the prior year period noncompensation expenses increased approximately 49 million over 2011 primarily reflecting higher legal defense costs for certain matters which are more fully discussed in the “contingencies” section of this mda below the increase compared to 2011 also reflects a fullyear of expenses relating to the fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions of copal and bh as well as investments in it infrastructure and higher variable costs to support business growth 

the nontax deductible goodwill impairment charge of 122 million relates to the fstc reporting unit within ma this impairment resulted from lower projected cash flows for this reporting unit as many individuals and global financial institutions have reduced spending on training and certification services amidst macroeconomic uncertainties in north america and emea 

depreciation and amortization of 935 million in 2012 increased 143 million from 2011 reflecting higher amortization of i internal use software and ii intangible assets acquired as part of the fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions of copal and bh 

operating income of 10774 million increased 1890 million from 2011 reflecting revenue growth outpacing the increase in total expenses adjusted operating income was 11831 million in 2012 and increased 2155 million compared to 2011 operating margin and adjusted operating margin in 2012 of 395 and 433 respectively increased 50bps and 90bps respectively compared to the prior year and reflected revenue growth exceeding expense growth changes in fx translation rates had an approximate 30 million unfavorable impact on both operating income and adjusted operating income in 2012 

interest income expense net in 2012 was 638 million a 17 million increase in expense compared to 2011 this increase is primarily due to higher interest on borrowings reflecting the issuance of the 2012 senior notes in the third quarter of 2012 partially offset by an approximate 7 million reversal of interest on utps in 2012 due to the settlement of state and local tax audits 

other nonoperating income expense net was 104 million in 2012 or 31 million lower compared to 2011 and reflected approximately 6 million in fx losses in 2012 compared to fx gains of approximately 3 million in 2011 the fx losses in 2012 related primarily to the decline of the euro relative to the british pound the fx losses were partially offset by a higher legacy tax benefit in 2012 compared to 2011 128 million in 2012 compared to 64 million in 2011 

the company’s etr was 317 in 2012 up slightly from 312 in 2011 the increase was primarily due to the reversal of utps in the prior year resulting from a foreign tax ruling as well as benefits from the settlement of state tax audits in 2011 these items were partially offset by the favorable impact of tax planning initiatives in 2012 

net income in 2012 was 6900 million or 305 per diluted share and included a 128 million benefit from the favorable settlement of a legacy tax matter and a 122 million nontax deductible goodwill impairment charge this is an increase of 1186 million or 056 per diluted share compared to 2011 when net income included a 70 million net benefit or 003 per diluted share relating to the favorable resolution of a legacy tax matter as well as other tax benefits totaling 009 excluding benefits from the favorable resolutions of legacy tax matters in both 2012 and 2011 net income in 2012 increased 1128 million or 053 per diluted share compared to the prior year

the table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results followed by further insight and commentary 

 

 the following is a discussion of external mis revenue and operating expenses 

global mis revenue of 18868 million in 2012 increased 3179 million compared to 2011 and reflected growth in all ratings lobs the growth over the prior year period reflected robust rated issuance volumes for highyield corporate debt and bank loans as well as investmentgrade corporate debt additionally the growth reflects higher rated issuance within public finance the growth also reflected changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases primarily in the us transaction revenue for mis was 62 and 58 in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

in the us revenue was 11129 million in 2012 an increase of 2338 million or 27 compared to 2011 the increase reflects the aforementioned robust rated issuance volumes in the highyield and investmentgrade corporate debt sectors as well as the public finance sector the increase also reflects growth in rated issuance volumes for cmbs within sfg and the aforementioned changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases 

nonus revenue was 7739 million in 2012 an increase of 841 million or 12 compared to 2011 the growth over 2011 reflects higher rated issuance volumes for investment grade corporate debt as well as highyield corporate debt and bank loans across all regions additionally there was higher bankingrelated revenue across all regions coupled with higher infrastructure finance issuance in emea also contributing to the growth over 2011 were benefits from changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases partially offsetting these increases were declines across most asset classes within sfg in the emea region changes in fx translation rates had an approximate 37 million unfavorable impact on nonus mis revenue in 2012 

global cfg revenue of 8576 million in 2012 increased 2055 million from 2011 reflecting growth in rated issuance volumes for highyield and investmentgrade corporate debt across all regions additionally there was an increase in monitoring fees as well as fees for commercial paper and medium term note programs also contributing to the growth in revenue were changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases primarily in the us the aforementioned higher rated issuance volumes for investment grade corporate debt largely reflected issuers taking advantage of the overall low interest rate environment to issue new debt as well as refinance existing borrowings the increase in us rated issuance volumes in the highyield sector reflects the current low interest rate environment coupled with an increase in investor demand for higheryielding securities transaction revenue represented 74 of total cfg revenue in 2012 compared to 71 in 2011 in the us revenue in 2012 was 5618 million or 1395 million higher than 2011 internationally revenue of 2958 million in 2012 increased 660 million compared to 2011 unfavorable changes in fx translation rates had an approximate 14 million impact on international cfg revenue in 2012 

global sfg revenue of 3810 million in 2012 increased 364 million compared to 2011 and reflected higher rated issuance volumes across all asset classes in the us these increases were partially offset by revenue declines in all asset classes in the emea region 

  

 the aforementioned increases in the us resulted in transaction revenue increasing to 58 of total sfg revenue in 2012 compared to 52 in 2011 in the us revenue of 2074 million increased 458 million compared to 2011 reflecting growth in reit cmbs collateralized loan obligation and assetbacked securities rated issuance volumes the growth in these asset classes reflects the current low interest rate environment and narrow credit spreads for these securities the growth in cmbs rated issuance volumes also reflects increasing activity in bank conduit operations nonus revenue in 2012 of 1736 million decreased 94 million compared to 2011 this decrease was primarily due to lower assetbacked securities issuance in emea reflecting strong issuance in 2011 when issuers were requesting a second rating for these securities in the first quarter of 2011 which was a new requirement by the ecb for existing assetbacked securities that could be used as collateral in eurosystem credit operations the decrease also reflects lower covered bond issuance in the emea region due to continued macroeconomic uncertainties in europe these decreases were partially offset by modest growth across many asset classes in the asiapacific and americas regions unfavorable changes in fx translation rates had an approximate 11 million impact on international sfg revenue in 2012 

global fig revenue of 3255 million in 2012 was 306 million higher compared to 2011 and reflected higher bankingrelated issuance in the us as well as the asia and americas regions coupled with benefits from changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and pricing increases primarily in the us also contributing to the increase was higher insurance revenue in the us reflecting issuers opportunistically refinancing debt amidst favorable interest rate conditions coupled with issuance to fund ma activity in the sector transaction revenue was 37 of total fig revenue in 2012 compared to 34 in 2011 in the us and internationally revenue was 1350 million and 1905 million respectively for 2012 or 14 and 8 higher respectively compared to 2011 unfavorable changes in fx translation rates had an approximate 8 million impact on international fig revenue in 2012 

global ppif revenue was 3227 million in 2012 an increase of 454 million compared to 2011 primarily reflecting both increases in us public and project finance rated issuance volumes as well as the favorable impact of the aforementioned changes in the mix of fee type new fee initiatives and pricing increases primarily in the us revenue generated from new transactions was 61 and 58 of total ppif revenue in 2012 and 2011 respectively in the us revenue in 2012 was 2087 million and increased 322 million compared to 2011 reflecting higher rated issuance volumes in pfg and project finance as well as the aforementioned pricing increases the increase in rated issuance volumes within pfg reflects issuers opportunistically refinancing obligations ahead of scheduled maturities in the current low interest rate environment as well as a challenging prior year period when issuance had declined reflecting the expiration of the build america bond program in the fourth quarter of 2010 outside the us ppif revenue increased 13 compared to 2011 due to growth in infrastructure finance rated issuance volumes in the emea region which reflects a partial easing of macroeconomic concerns following the ecb’s bond purchasing program announced in the third quarter of 2012 unfavorable changes in fx translation rates had an approximate 5 million impact on international ppif revenue in 2012 

operating and sga expenses in 2012 increased 1335 million compared to 2011 and reflected increases in compensation and noncompensation costs of approximately 87 million and 47 million respectively the increase in compensation costs reflects higher salaries and employee benefits resulting from annual merit increases headcount growth in the ratings lobs as well as in support areas such as it finance and human resources for which the costs are allocated to each segment based on a revenuesplit methodology the increase in compensation costs is also due to higher incentive compensation which reflects greater achievement against fullyear 2012 targeted results compared to achievement in 2011 compensation costs also increased due to higher pension expense resulting from a decrease in the discount rate used to value the company’s obligation and higher amortization of actuarial losses the increase in noncompensation expenses reflected higher costs resulting from the company’s continued investment in improving it infrastructure and regulatory and compliance initiatives coupled with higher variable costs reflecting improving business conditions additionally the increase in noncompensation expenses reflects higher legal defense costs relating to ongoing matters which are more fully discussed in the “contingencies” section of this mda 

adjusted operating income in 2012 was 9912 million an increase of 1901 million compared to 2011 operating income in 2012 of 9469 million which includes intersegment royalty revenue and intersegment expenses increased 1871 million from 2011 and reflects the 3236 million increase in total mis revenue outpacing the 1365 million increase in total expenses adjusted operating margin and operating margin were 506 and 484 respectively or 160bps and 190bps higher compared to 2011 reflecting revenue growth exceeding the increase in expenses

the table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results followed by further insight and commentary 

 

 the following is a discussion of external ma revenue and operating expenses 

global ma revenue increased 1317 million compared to 2011 with 60 of the growth generated internationally and included revenue from copal and bh which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 recurring revenue comprised 77 of total ma revenue in 2012 compared to 80 in 2011 

in the us revenue of 3512 million in 2012 increased 533 million and reflected growth across all three lobs international revenue of 4923 million in 2012 was 784 million higher than in 2011 and reflected growth across all lobs

 nongaap financial measures 

in addition to its reported results moody’s has included in this mda certain adjusted results that the sec defines as “nongaap financial measures” management believes that such nongaap financial measures when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the company’s performance facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking these nongaap measures as defined by the company are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies furthermore these nongaap measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other gaap measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the company below are brief descriptions of the company’s nongaap financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the nongaap measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure 

  

 adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin  

the company presents adjusted operating income because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating performance of moody’s measuring the company’s ability to service debt fund capital expenditures and expand its business adjusted operating income excludes depreciation and amortization as well as goodwill impairment charges because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring productive assets including goodwill companies also have difference methods of depreciating and amortizing productive assets as well as different methods of valuing goodwill management believes that the exclusion of certain items detailed in the reconciliation below allows for a more meaningful comparison of the company’s operating results from period to period and across companies below is a reconciliation of the company’s operating income and operating margin to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin 

 

 proforma net income and diluted eps attributable to moody’s common shareholders 

the company presents these nongaap measures to exclude the impacts of legacy tax and restructuringrelated items to allow for a more meaningful comparison of moody’s net income and diluted earnings per share from period to period the legacy tax items are specific to the company resulting from the 2000 distribution the restructuring items relate to certain costs incurred in connection with the 2007 restructuring plan and the 2009 restructuring plan below is a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable us gaap amount 

 

  

   

 free cash flow 

the company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital additions management believes that free cash flow is a useful metric in assessing the company’s cash flows to service debt pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases management deems capital expenditures essential to the company’s product and service innovations and maintenance of moody’s operational capabilities accordingly capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of moody’s cash flow below is a reconciliation of the company’s net cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow 

 

 2013 outlook 

moody’s outlook for 2013 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates corporate profitability and business investment spending merger and acquisition activity consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued there is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook the company’s guidance assumes foreign currency translation at endofquarter exchange rates

moody’s continues to have exposure to potential liabilities arising from legacy tax matters as of december 31 2012 moody’s has recorded liabilities for legacy tax matters totaling 392 million this includes liabilities and accrued interest due to new db arising from the 2000 distribution agreement it is possible that the ultimate liability for legacy tax matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the company which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody’s future reported results financial position and cash flows 

the following summary of the relationships among moody’s new db and their predecessor entities is important in understanding the company’s exposure to the legacy tax matters 

in november 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation separated into three separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation acnielsen corporation and cognizant corporation in june 1998 the dun  bradstreet corporation separated into two separate public companies old db and rh donnelley corporation during 1998 cognizant separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated and nielsen media research inc in september 2000 old db separated into two separate public companies new db and moody’s 

old db and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities old db and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable irs determinations on certain tax matters and certain other potential tax liabilities all as described in such agreements further in connection with the 2000 distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement new db and moody’s have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to these legacy tax matters 

  

 at the time of the 2000 distribution new db paid moody’s 550 million for 50 of certain anticipated future tax benefits through 2012 in the event that these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by new db or there is an irs audit of new db impacting these tax benefits moody’s would be required to repay to new db an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits as well as its share of any tax liability incurred by new db in june 2011 the statute of limitations for new db relating to the 2004 tax year expired as a result in the second quarter of 2011 moody’s recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of 28 million 17 million net of tax and an increase in other nonoperating income of 64 million relating to amounts due to new db in august 2012 new db effectively settled examinations for the 2005 and 2006 tax years as a result in the third quarter of 2012 moody’s recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of 44 million 26 million net of tax and an increase in other nonoperating income of 128 million relating to amounts due to new db as of december 31 2012 moody’s liability with respect to this matter totaled 371 million 

additionally in april 2011 moody’s received a refund of 09 million 06 million net of tax for interest assessed related to prespinoff tax years 

in 2005 settlement agreements were executed with the irs with respect to certain legacy tax matters related to the years 19891990 and 19931996 with respect to these settlements moody’s and new db believed that ims health and nmr did not pay their full share of the liability to the irs under the terms of the applicable separation agreements between the parties moody’s and new db subsequently paid these amounts to the irs and commenced arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr to resolve this dispute pursuant to these arbitration proceedings the company received 108 million 65 million as a reduction of interest expense and 43 million as a reduction of tax expense in 2009 the aforementioned settlement payment resulted in net income benefits of 82 million in 2009 the company carries a 21 million liability for this matter

the company 

moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings ii credit and economic related research data and analytical tools iii risk management software iv quantitative credit risk measures credit portfolio management solutions training and financial credentialing and certification services and v outsourced research and analytical services to institutional customers moody’s reports in two reportable segments mis and ma the mis segment consists of all credit rating activity all of moody’s other nonrating commercial activities are included within the ma segment financial information and operating results of these segments including revenue expenses operating income and total assets are included in part ii item 8 financial statements of this annual report and are herein incorporated by reference 

mis the credit rating agency publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide including various corporate and governmental obligations structured finance securities and commercial paper programs revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to investors mis provides ratings in more than 110 countries ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media including the internet and realtime information systems widely used by securities traders and investors as of december 31 2011 mis had ratings relationships with approximately 11000 corporate issuers and approximately 22000 public finance issuers additionally the company has rated and currently monitors ratings on approximately 94000 structured finance obligations representing approximately 14000 transactions the aforementioned amounts relating to the number of issuers and transactions represent issuers or transactions that had an active rating at any point during the year ended december 31 2011

 prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets grew significantly in terms of the amount and the types of securities or other obligations outstanding beginning in mid2007 there was a severe market disruption and a global decline in issuance activity for some significant asset classes despite the market disruption moody’s believes that the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued global growth of fixedincome markets including the market for related financial information such as credit opinions data analytics and related services moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including 

 

  

  

 throughout 2011 there were continued signs of gradual improvement in the health of the us economy while the global economy continued to experience more volatility with european sovereign debt and related banking sector concerns offset by strong economic growth in emerging markets continued improvement of the us economy and housing sector as well as a potential resolution to the european sovereign debt crisis should influence the company’s growth over the near term furthermore moody’s is well positioned to benefit from a longterm recovery in global credit market activity and a more informed use of credit ratings research and related analytical products in an environment of renewed attention to risk analysis and risk management moody’s expects that these developments will support continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions research data and risk management tools and services an expectation of recoverydriven growth in capital market activity supported by initiatives to increase market share leverage pricing opportunities capture disintermediation activity in developed and developing markets and develop additional data research and rating products represent key growth drivers for moody’s 

growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates business investment spending corporate refunding needs merger and acquisition activity and consumer borrowing and securitization rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the dollarequivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets mis’s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and the prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decision process however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings and other areas partially mitigate mis’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global capital markets furthermore the strong growth trend seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid1990’s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010 the market disruptions that escalated in 2008 are expected to continue in the immediate term however moody’s has seen some revenue stabilization from this market in 2011 despite significant declines from peak market levels moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global credit markets and will provide opportunities for longer term revenue growth moody’s will continue to monitor this market and adapt to meet the changing needs of its participants 

longer term growth in global fixedincome markets is also attributable to a number of forces and trends such as advances in information technology and disintermediation of financial systems the pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell which in the absence of the appropriate technology may not be easily obtainable this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of developed capital markets and a number of new capital markets as technology provides for wider access to worldwide markets it also results in a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk data analytics and related services additionally information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support moody’s continued expansion in developing markets 

an ongoing trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets recent credit market disruptions which began in mid2007 initially slowed the trend of disintermediation globally but moody’s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems in fact disintermediation has accelerated in some markets over the past year as deleveraging by banks has encouraged corporations and other entities to seek alternative funding in bond 

  

 markets while in key emerging markets strong economic growth is out pacing banking system capacity thus disintermediation is expected to accelerate in the longerterm with moody’s continuing to target investment and resources to growing international markets where disintermediation and bond issuance should remain more robust 

in response to the 20082009 credit crisis and to address new regulation and ongoing volatility in the capital markets financial institutions are investing in people processes and systems to enhance risk management and compliance functions regulations such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act basel ii basel iii solvency ii and others may stimulate demand for moody’s analytics products financial institutions are also investing in advanced qualitative and quantitative tools and services to support their management of complex balance sheets and diverse portfolios moody’s analytics offers a suite of risk management products and services to address these needs including but not limited to risk management software economic analysis training and professional services 

legislative bodies and regulators in the us europe and selective other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of cras which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of mis or increased costs of doing business for mis therefore in order to broaden the potential for expansion of nonratings services moody’s reorganized in january 2008 into two distinct businesses mis consisting solely of the ratings business and ma ma conducts all nonratings activities including the sale of credit research produced by mis and the production and sale of other economic and creditrelated products and services the reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by ma into activities which may have otherwise been restricted for mis due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities 

moody’s operations are subject to various risks as more fully described in part i item 1a “risk factors” inherent in conducting business internationally such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources however the formation of for example a new governmentsponsored regional or global rating agency would pose a risk to mis’s growth prospects management believes that this risk compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry is relatively low because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required with uncertainty about the likelihood of financial success for the entity 

competition 

the mis business competes with other cras and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research many users of mis’s ratings also have inhouse credit research capabilities mis’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp ratings services while in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp ratings services mis’s competitors include fitch ratings dominion bond rating service ltd am best company inc japan credit rating agency ltd kroll bond rating agency inc morningstar inc and eganjones ratings company in europe examples of competitors include euler hermes rating feri eurorating creditreform rating psr rating icap group and companhia portuguesa de rating there are additional competitors in other regions and countries for example in china where moody’s operates through a joint venture these competitors include china lianhe credit rating co ltd shanghai brilliance credit rating  investors service co ltd dagong global credit rating co ltd and pengyuan credit rating co ltd 

ma competes broadly in the financial information industry against diversified competitors such as thomson reuters markets division bloomberg sp capital iqsp indices fitch solutions dun  bradstreet ibm wolters kluwer sungard sas fiserv msci and markit group among others ma’s main competitors within rda include sp capital iqsp indices creditsights thomsonreuters intex ihs global insight blackrock solutions factset and other smaller boutique providers of fixed income analytics valuations economic data and research in rms ma faces competition from both large software providers such as ibm algorithmics sungard sas oracle mysis oliver wyman verisk and other various smaller vendors and inhouse solutions within professional services ma competes with omega performance dc gardner and a host of financial training and education boutiques and with evalueserve amba crisil global research  analytics and other providers of outsourced research and consulting services 

  

 moody’s strategy 

moody’s corporate strategy is to be the world’s most respected authority serving credit sensitive markets the key aspects to implement this strategy are to 

 

  

 moody’s will invest to defend and enhance the core businesses in an attempt to position the company to fully capture market opportunities resulting from global debt capital market expansion and increased business investment spending moody’s will also make strategic investments to achieve scale in attractive financial information markets move into attractive adjacencies where the company can leverage its core competencies and expand our footprint in high growth emerging markets 

to broaden the company’s potential moody’s reorganized in 2008 creating the ma business focused on all nonratings activities this adds considerable value in three ways first ma adds a significant base of recurring revenue to offset potential volatility in ratings issuance volumes impacting mis second ma provides a foothold in emerging markets selling products and services such as training consulting and bank system implementation before these debt capital markets are fully mature finally ma provides holistic financial risk management credit solutions sought by the company’s customers 

moody’s invests in a portfolio of initiatives to implement our strategy through organic development and targeted acquisitions example initiatives include 

 

  

  

 the 2011 acquisitions of barrie  hibbert and majority stake in the companies of copal partners advanced moody’s strategy bh is a leading provider of risk management modeling tools for insurance companies worldwide copal is among the world’s leading providers of outsourced research and analytical services to institutional customers both companies will help the company pursue its objective to be the world’s foremost authority and services provider in credit risksensitive markets 

regulation 

mis and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the us and in other countries including by state and local authorities thus existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company’s operations and the markets for securities that it rates additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered each of the existing adopted proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which moody’s operates 

in the us mis has been designated as an nrsro by the sec since 1975 and pursuant to the substantive regulatory authority granted to the sec under the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 has been registered as an nrsro since september 2007 the reform act provided the sec with authority to oversee nrsros while prohibiting the sec from regulating the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any nrsro determines credit ratings pursuant to the reform act the sec has adopted regulations applicable to rating agencies which register as nrsros addressing among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 provisions of the financial reform act which was enacted in 2010 seek among other things to enhance transparency and accountability in the credit rating agency industry and to reduce the regulatory reliance on credit ratings the majority of the provisions of subtitle c of title ix of the financial reform act seek to regulate the activities of those cras that are registered under the sec’s regulatory framework for nrsros and thus apply to mis 

among other provisions applicable to nrsros the financial reform act 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the sec and other federal regulators are in the process of implementing provisions of the financial reform act applicable to nrsros and rating agencies events surrounding the implementation have included 

 

  

  

 the sec also has adopted or proposed a number of regulations affecting securities that are rated by mis and that otherwise affect the market for ratings including proposals to require disclosure about credit ratings in certain registered securities offerings and rules affecting disclosures and the operation of the structured finance products 

internationally several regulatory developments have occurred 

eu—in 2009 the european parliament passed a new regulation “eu regulation” that establishes an oversight regime for the cra industry in the european union the framework for the eu regulation requires the registration formal regulation and periodic inspection of cras operating in the eu the eu regulation also sets out specific requirements for the use of ratings that are produced outside of the eu and are used for regulatory purposes in the eu among these is a requirement for the relevant competent authority in the eu and the competent authority of the noneu jurisdiction where that rating has been produced to enter into a cooperation agreement containing provisions related to the exchange of information and the coordination of supervisory activities the eu regulation became fully effective in september 2010 mis applied for registration in august 2010 and was granted registration in october 2011 in addition the european securities and market authority esma was established in january 2011 and has had direct supervisory responsibility for registered cra industry in the eu since july 2011 

the regulatory framework of the cra industry continues to be discussed in the european union 

in november 2011 the european commission issued proposed amendments to its existing regulations if enacted as proposed the revised regulations among other things would 

 

  

  

   

   

  

 the next stages of the legislative process include deliberation and potential amendments by both the european parliament and the council of european finance ministers the parliament council and commission must all confer and agree on a final text the company expects this process may take from four to eight months during which time moody’s will continue to consult with relevant authorities and market participants as to the impact of the specific proposals on the financial markets issuers and investors 

the g8 and the g20 have over the past several years 

 

  

  

 iosco has published a code of conduct fundamentals for credit rating agencies in 2009 iosco published its second review of the cras implementation of the iosco code the report noted that seven out of the 21 cras reviewed had implemented the iosco code in their own codes of conduct in particular mis was found to have substantially implemented the 2008 revisions to the iosco code in addition iosco announced in 2009 the establishment of a new standing committee that will address global issues regarding the cra industry 

mis has revised its code of professional conduct fashioned on the iosco code on several occasions to reflect the changes made to the iosco code and the broader changes in the regulatory environment for cras beginning in 2006 mis has annually published a report that describes its implementation of its code the mis code and implementation reports can be found on the company’s website 

the basel committee—in 2004 the basel committee on banking supervision published a bank capital adequacy framework called basel ii to replace its initial 1988 framework under basel ii ratings assigned by recognized cras or ecais can be used by banks in determining credit risk weights for many of their institutional credit exposures recognized ecais could be subject to a broader range of oversight mis has been recognized as an ecai in many jurisdictions as a result of the recent developments in the financial markets the banking authorities of the basel committee have been reconsidering the overall framework work on the new framework basel iii is now complete it is to be implemented in stages beginning in 2010 and concluding in 2018 basel iii continues to use credit ratings as a tool in bank supervision however the form and extent of this use is currently under debate by global prudential regulators 

other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future in addition in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which mis operates the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of mis cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s 

intellectual property

 item 1a   risk factors tableend the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occur moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry are rapidly evolving and may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

credit rating agencies are regulated in both the us by federal state and local authorities and in other countries over the past few years many jurisdictions have adopted or proposed new laws and regulations that impact the operation of credit rating agencies and the markets for securities that are rated additional laws and regulations have been proposed or are being considered and further legislation or regulation may be proposed or implemented in the future some of the more prominent developments are discussed below or under the section entitled “regulation” in part i item 1 of this form 10k these laws and regulations are intended to cause or may result in increased competition in the credit rating business in addition these laws or regulations may cause or result in i alternatives to credit ratings ii regulations or restrictions on how information is used in the development or maintenance of credit ratings iii increased regulatory oversight of the credit markets and credit rating agency operation iv limits on the number of years that a credit rating agency can rate securities of a particular issuer or v changes in the pricing of credit ratings all of these items could result in an increase in costs that moody’s may not be able to pass through to customers and a decrease in the demand for or changes in the use of credit ratings 

new pleading and liability standards that have been adopted in the us and proposed elsewhere may subject credit rating agencies to a greater number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities may place greater burdens on credit rating agencies to defend themselves could result in such legal proceedings continuing for a greater period of time before being resolved and could result in increased uncertainty over and exposure to liability of credit rating agencies as new laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies rapidly evolve the costs of compliance are expected to increase and moody’s may not be able to pass on these costs through the pricing of its services in addition there may be greater uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of new laws and regulations which may increase compliance costs and increase the possibility of fines penalties or other sanctions including restrictions on activities being imposed 

  

 given the comparatively recent adoption and the number of additional reforms that have been or are proposed to be adopted including those under the legislative and regulatory initiatives discussed below moody’s is unable to accurately assess the future impact of any regulatory changes that may result or the impact on moody’s competitive position current practices or business prospects although these recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally they may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner responding to these developments will increase moody’s fixed and variable costs of operations perhaps to a degree that is significantly greater than moody’s currently expects and may materially reduce mis revenue moody’s may not be able to pass through or otherwise recoup or offset such costs or lost revenue these developments may alter mis’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which mis’s ratings are developed assigned and communicated and decrease demand or affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate and alter the economics of the credit ratings business including by restricting or mandating the business models under which a rating agency is permitted to operate moody’s stock price may also be affected by speculation regarding legislative and regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on moody’s business and by increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which moody’s operates in ways that cannot presently be predicted 

in the us mis is designated as an nrsro pursuant to sec regulations adopted under the reform act one of the central tenets of the reform act was to encourage competition among rating agencies the reform act established standards for the sec to have direct jurisdiction over credit rating agencies that seek nrsro status and to inspect their operations 

in the us one of the tenets of the financial reform act enacted in 2011 is that credit rating agencies play an important role in the financial market and should be subject to enhanced oversight standards that could result in enhanced liability the financial reform act amends a number of laws and regulations requires the sec to adopt a number of rules affecting rating agencies and the use of credit ratings especially in structured finance markets and authorizes a number of studies relating to the operations and legal standards applicable to cras provisions of the financial reform act and other rules that have recently been or may be adopted by the sec in furtherance of the financial reform act that pose risks to the company’s business include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the financial reform act’s rescission of rule 436g under the securities act which was an exemption from expert liability under the securities act for ratings information included in registration statements could impact moody’s in a number of ways sec rules relating to offerings of assetbacked securities that are registered with the sec require certain disclosures regarding credit ratings if as is common in the market for such securities the issuance or sale of any class of such assetbacked securities is conditioned on the assignment of a rating by one or more rating agencies as a result of the repeal of rule 436g under the securities act and accordingly the imposition of a heightened liability standard that would result from such disclosures mis and other credit rating agencies have declined to consent to issuers of such securities making such disclosures regarding their ratings the staff of the sec has informally advised issuers of assetbacked securities that pending further review of rulemaking required under the financial reform act the sec staff will not recommend enforcement action if an issuer omits the ratings disclosure required by sec rules for registered offerings of assetbacked securities if the sec staff position were reversed or if sec rules otherwise were adopted or applied in a manner that resulted in rating agencies being subject to heightened standards of liability in such offerings it could adversely impact the volume of securities sold in such offerings demand for mis’s ratings the pricing structure for ratings issued by mis andor moody’s exposure to liability and could have other effects that moody’s is not able to predict any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

in addition in october 2009 the sec proposed a rule providing that if credit ratings are used in connection with an offering of any other type of security that is registered under the securities act which as proposed would include use of a credit rating for certain 

  

 unregistered securities offerings that are subsequently subject to a registered exchange offer the ratings must be included in the registration statement if adopted this proposal coupled with the financial reform act’s rescission of rule 436g would mean that common practices used in the us to market and sell securities in such offerings would have to be altered unless mis or other credit rating agencies consented to subject themselves to expert liability provisions of the securities act with respect to their credit ratings adoption of this or a similar rule could impact the volume of securities sold in such offerings demand for mis’s ratings the pricing structure for ratings issued by mis andor moody’s exposure to liability and could have other effects that moody’s is not able to predict any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

both the g8 and the g20 have sought to analyze and arrive at a consistent approach for addressing various areas of the financial market and have made a variety of recommendations as to regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings specifically the g20 has agreed to require the registration of rating agencies in their home jurisdiction as a result of the internationally coordinated approach countries other than the us which as noted above had already adopted a registration regime for nrsros have begun the process of implementing registration regimes for the oversight of cras in particular the eu adopted a new regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the eu the regulation seeks to introduce a common eu regulatory approach to the oversight of cras its primary objective is to enhance the integrity transparency responsibility governance and reliability of credit rating activities by establishing conditions for the issuance of credit ratings and rules on the organization and conduct of credit rating agencies including restrictions on certain activities that are deemed to create a conflict of interest and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments the regulation became fully effective on september 6 2010 mis applied for registration in august 2010 and was granted registration in october 2011 

in addition the european securities and market authority became fully operational in july 2011 and now has direct supervisory authority for cras in the eu 

the european commission published a consultation paper on cras at the end of 2010 which covered the following topics 

 

  

  

  

  

 the eu parliament also published its own report discussing a number of these issues 

in furtherance of the foregoing the european commission issued proposed amendments to the existing regulations if enacted as proposed the revised regulations among other things would 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the foregoing initiatives if implemented and depending on their terms could have a significant negative effect on moody’s operations or profitability ability to compete or the markets for its products and services including in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict in particular exposure to increased liability under future eu regulation may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely affect moody’s results of operations moody’s also believes that the commission’s proposed rotation requirements if enacted would lead to a potentially significant decrease in revenue by restricting mis from continuing to rate issuers that currently pay for ratings and in particular frequent issuers compliance with the amended regulations may also increase costs of operations 

in addition to the foregoing in the wake of the credit crisis legislative and regulatory bodies in both the us and in other countries have adopted or are studying or pursuing new laws and regulations addressing cras and the use of credit ratings particularly in the area of structured finance securities and the role of cras leading up to the credit crisis 

  

 moody’s believes that there is still the potential for additional rulemaking that can significantly impact moody’s business it is likely that other jurisdictions will adopt additional laws or regulations affecting moody’s operations or the markets for its products and services this could include adopting regulations that affect the need for debt securities to be rated establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings however moody’s cannot predict the extent of the regulations that may be implemented or the effect that they may have on moody’s operations or the potential for increased exposure to liability 

exposure to litigation related to moody’s rating opinions 

moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities as part of ongoing investigations following the credit crisis and is responding to those inquiries in addition moody’s faces a greater amount of litigation than has historically been the case from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions as well as other related business practices due to the difficult economic times and turbulent markets over the last several years the market value of creditdependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased significantly increasing the number of legal proceedings including investigations moody’s is currently facing these proceedings impose additional expenses on the company which may increase over time as these matters progress procedurally require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues and given the number of these proceedings and significant amount of damages that may be sought present a greater risk that moody’s may be subject to fines penalties or damages if moody’s is deemed to have violated any laws or regulations in jurisdictions outside the us these types of proceedings may increase or become more costly because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that currently exist in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as provided by the first amendment may adopt legislation potentially imposing liability under specified circumstances and loosening pleading requirements and may pose a greater risk of criminal rather than civil penalties these risks often are and may continue to be difficult to assess or quantify moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time furthermore to the extent that moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals from the various litigation at an early stage and matters proceed to trial the aggregate legal defense costs to be incurred by moody’s could increase substantially regardless of the ultimate outcome 

in addition as discussed above the financial reform act revised pleading and liability standards and other provisions potentially subjecting cras to increased liability under securities law claims the financial reform act and regulations that will be adopted as a result of it may result in a material increase in the number of legal proceedings especially as related to future ratings and together with judicial decisions under the financial reform act and under preexisting legal standards may increase the potential legal exposure of cras changes in liability standards as well as pleading standards applicable in markets outside the us such as those recently proposed by the european commission also could create a greater potential for liability from operating in such markets the company believes that adoption of these provisions could negatively impact credit markets including causing cras to cease to issue ratings on certain securities or issuers increasing the cost of ratings delaying issuances of ratings and restricting the public availability of ratings which changes could materially negatively impact the company’s business and prospects it is possible that implementing changes to the company’s operations to address the changed pleading and liability standards may result in lower revenues andor increased expenses that the company may not be able to recoup or offset which could be material and the company may not be successful in avoiding or mitigating the impact of the heightened or changed pleading and liability standards 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets 

approximately 58 of mis’s revenue for 2011 was transactionbased compared to 57 of mis’s revenue in 2010 and 50 of mis’s revenue in 2009 revenue from rating transactions is dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets accordingly any conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollarequivalent volume of debt issuances for which mis provides ratings services and thereby have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings 

a significant disruption in world financial markets particularly in the credit markets began in mid2007 when many credit markets experienced a severe lack of liquidity this disruption continues to adversely affect our business as the markets struggle to recover credit market disruptions including those resulting from the sovereign debt crisis in europe together with the persistent economic slowdown have negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings future debt issuances could be negatively affected by a sharp increase in longterm interest rates or factors which cause instability or volatility in the global capital markets such as the recent credit market disruptions resulting from the sovereign debt crises in certain european countries new debt issuances in the structured finance market are likely to continue to be significantly below peak levels reached in the middle of the past decade consequently the company has experienced a reduction in the overall demand for rating newly issued debt securities changes in the markets for such securities and in the role and regulation of rating agencies may materially adversely affect the company even if the volume of securities issuances in all sectors recovers to or exceeds those experienced prior to 2007 

the timing nature extent and sustainability of any recovery in the credit and other financial markets remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that overall market conditions will improve in the future or that moody’s financial results will not continue to be 

  

 adversely affected a sustained period of market decline or weakness especially if it relates to credit sensitive securities for which there was historically a high level of demand for ratings could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business and financial results initiatives that the company has undertaken to reduce costs may not be sufficient and further cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the near term due in part to rent technology compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further the costreduction initiatives undertaken to date could result in strains in the company’s operations if the credit markets and demand for ratings in all sectors return to levels that prevailed prior to mid2007 or otherwise unexpectedly increase other factors that could further reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities include increases in interest rates or credit spreads continued volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment significant regulatory political or economic events the use of alternative sources of credit including financial institutions and government sources defaults of significant issuers and other unfavorable market and economic conditions 

furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional credit rating agencies such as mis changing regulatory considerations and other market developments could negatively affect the demand for credit ratings even if debt security issuances and activities increase as such no assurance can be given as to the amount of revenues that may be derived therefrom 

legal economic and regulatory risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions 

moody’s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the us in addition to the regulatory risks discussed above operations in different countries expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into us dollars and currency fluctuations the costs of repatriating cash held by entities outside the us us laws affecting overseas operations including domestic and foreign export and import restrictions tariffs and other trade barriers different legal or civil liability standards political and economic instability the possibility of nationalization expropriation price controls and other restrictive governmental actions longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables and potentially adverse tax consequences 

as moody’s derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the us moody’s business also is subject to changes in the economic condition of the various economies outside the us in which it operates for example economic developments in the european zone which is presently experiencing a degree of economic uncertainty or in southeast asia could affect the number of securities offerings undertaken within the particular area which in turn could affect moody’s business 

in its nonus operations moody’s is subject to regulations applicable under the office of foreign asset control the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and other anticorruption laws that generally prohibit us companies and their intermediaries from offering promising authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials which may include companies affiliated with foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which moody’s operates such as the united kingdom have also enacted similar laws violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the sec and us department of justice and their counterparts outside the us have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the fcpa and similar laws increasing the likelihood that a company will face costly investigations or penalties for actual or alleged violations of these laws internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that the company has implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting its employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing its policies and the law if moody’s employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing its international operations the company may face investigations prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in damage to our reputation as well as civil penalties administrative remedies and criminal sanctions any determination that the company has violated the fcpa or other similar laws could have a material adverse effect on moody’s financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions 

in addition to competition from other rating agencies that operate in a number of international jurisdictions and specialized companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company inc with respect to the insurance industry in many foreign countries mis competes with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence and greater familiarity or a longer operating history in those markets these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions that mis does not receive putting mis at a competitive disadvantage 

increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service as well as increased competition from nonnrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors at the same time bankruptcies and consolidation of customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of customers while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and service if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with 

  

 its current and future competitors moody’s may lose market share in addition one of the central goals of the reform act was to encourage competition among rating agencies the formation of additional nrsros may increase pricing as well as other competitive pressures 

exposure to reputational and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation is one of the key bases on which the company competes to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors has suffered a loss in credibility in the course of the credit crisis or in the future suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be adversely affected factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities the timing and nature of changes in ratings adverse publicity as to the ratings process and its implementation with respect to one or more securities a major compliance failure publicity associated with ongoing litigation and new laws and regulations and increased criticism by users of ratings regulators and legislative bodies these concerns may be disclosed or highlighted in the course of various investigations or lawsuits that have been or may be instituted through legislative or regulatory hearings or special studies that are mandated by legislation or through journalists or others attempting to chronicle or report on the recent credit crisis operational errors whether by moody’s or a moody’s competitor could harm the reputation of the credit rating industry and adversely affect moody’s business 

introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies 

the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are highly competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and to utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by moody’s customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and its growth prospects in addition moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by limitations of its information technologies that fail to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors 

significant amount of intangible assets 

moody’s has a significant amount of intangible assets on its balance sheet consisting of 6429 million of goodwill and 2536 million of amortizable intangible assets approximately 99 of these intangibles reside in the ma business and are allocated to the five reporting units within ma rda rms training csi and copal failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in one or all of these reporting units could result in an asset impairment charge which would reduce net income in the period the impairment is recorded impairment of goodwill or intangibles would result in a noncash charge to operating expenses an impairment would be recorded if the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group which holds goodwill or any intangible assets is less than the carrying amount of its net assets a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group is its projected cash flows future cash flows of ma are dependent on a variety of factors such as but not limited to general economic growth capital market activity product innovation pricing market share and competition changes in these factors or in the conduct of moody’s operations in response to such factors could lead to reduced cash flows resulting in an asset impairment charge 

possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures 

moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting retaining and motivating highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering higher compensation than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis 

the trading price of moody’s stock could be affected by third party actions 

ownership of moody’s stock is highly concentrated with a majority of shares held by a few institutional stockholders due to this concentrated stockholder base the trading price of moody’s stock could be affected considerably by actions of significant stockholders to increase or decrease their positions in moody’s stock 

  

 moody’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located including having its headquarters in new york city and offices in major cities worldwide this may include a disruption involving electrical communications or other services used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business whether due to human error natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage computer viruses intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism or war or otherwise moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of major operating systems may not be successful the company in a number of instances relies on third party providers to provide essential services while the company believes that such third parties are reliable the company obviously has less control over the performance of such providers the company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations their ability to service and interact with moody’s clients and customers may suffer the company’s operations also rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks the business relies upon and processes a great deal of data through its systems the security and quality of which must be maintained in order for the business units to perform protective measures that moody’s takes may be circumvented or may not be sufficient to guard its computer systems software and networks from unauthorized access computer viruses or other malicious events that could have a security impact if one or more of such events occur this could jeopardize moody’s or its clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through its computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s its clients’ its counterparties’ or third parties’ operations moody’s may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures and the company may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by moody’s

following the events in the us subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly over the last several years mis and other credit rating agencies are the subject of intense scrutiny increased regulation ongoing investigation and civil litigation legislative regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are considering additional legislation regulation and enforcement actions including with respect to mis’s compliance with newly imposed regulatory standards moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other governmental authorities and is responding to such investigations and inquiries 

in addition the company is facing litigation from market participants relating to the performance of mis rated securities although moody’s in the normal course experiences such litigation the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased following the events in the us subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly over the last several years

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moody’s corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

this mda contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” commencing on page 59 and item 1a “risk factors” commencing on page 16 for a discussion of uncertainties risks and other factors associated with these statements 

the company 

moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings ii credit and economic related research data and analytical tools iii risk management software iv quantitative credit risk measures credit portfolio management solutions training and financial credentialing and certification services and v outsourced research and analytical services to institutional customers moody’s operates in two reportable segments mis and ma 

mis the credit rating agency publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors 

the ma segment which includes all of the company’s nonrating commercial activities develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets within its rda business ma distributes investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies and commentary on topical credit related events the rda business also produces and provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores within its rms business ma provides both economic and regulatory capital risk management software solutions within its professional services business it provides quantitative credit risk measures credit portfolio management solutions training financial credentialing and certification services as well as outsourced research and analytical services to institutional investors 

moody’s purchased csi and copal in november 2010 and 2011 respectively which are currently separate reporting units within ma and for which revenues are reported within the professional services lob moody’s purchased bh in december 2011 which is currently part of the rms reporting unit and lob within ma 

c ritical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets restructuring liabilities pension and other postretirement benefits utbs and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable 

in october 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200913 “multipledeliverable revenue arrangements” “asu 200913” the standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of each deliverable the company has adopted asu 200913 on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified on or after january 1 2010 if applied in the same manner to the year ended december 31 2009 asu 200913 would not have had a material impact on net revenue reported for both its mis and ma segments in terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition the adoption of asu 200913 did not have a significant effect on the company’s net revenue in the period of adoption and is also not expected to have a significant effect on the 

  

 company’s net revenue in periods after the initial adoption when applied to multiple element arrangements based on the currently anticipated business volume and pricing 

for 2010 and future periods pursuant to the guidance of asu 200913 when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available third party evidence if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 

the company’s products and services will generally continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under asu 200913 the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control in instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit 

the company determines whether its selling price in a multielement transaction meets the vsoe criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately in instances where the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range or only having a limited sales history the company attempts to establish tpe for deliverables the company determines whether tpe exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers however due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing possible differences in the company’s market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the company may contain a significant level of differentiation andor customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained the company generally is unable to reliably determine tpe based on the selling price hierarchy established by asu 200913 when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe the company will establish an esp esp is the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis the company establishes its best estimate of esp considering internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives standalone sales prices of similar products percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service and customer segment and geography additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend the company reviews its determination of vsoe tpe and esp on an annual basis or more frequently as needed 

in the mis segment revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed generally one year in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities derivatives international residential mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities which ranged from two to 51 years at december 31 2011 at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately 79 million 76 million and 78 million respectively 

multiple element revenue arrangements in the mis segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service beginning january 1 2010 in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees the company generally uses esp in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for initial ratings prior to january 1 2010 and pursuant to the previous accounting standards for these types of arrangements the initial rating fee was first allocated to the monitoring service determined based on the estimated fair market value of monitoring services with the residual amount allocated to the initial rating under asu 200913 this practice can no longer be used for nonsoftware deliverables 

mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 accounts receivable included approximately 24 million 25 million and 27 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings furthermore for certain annual monitoring services fees are not invoiced until the end of the annual monitoring period and revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period 

in the ma segment products and services offered by the company include software licenses and related maintenance subscriptions and professional services revenue from subscription based products such as research and data subscriptions and certain softwarebased credit risk management subscription products is recognized ratably over the related subscription period which is principally one year revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or 

  

 first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period revenue from services rendered within the professional services line of business is generally recognized as the services are performed if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs a large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of november december and january 

products and services offered within the ma segment are sold either standalone or together in various combinations in instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and nonsoftware deliverables revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above 

if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using vsoe in the instances where the company is not able to determine vsoe for all of the deliverables of an arrangement the company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its vsoe and the residual revenue to the delivered elements if the company is unable to determine vsoe for an undelivered element the company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the company has delivered all of the elements or when vsoe has been determined for the undelivered elements 

prior to january 1 2010 and pursuant to the previous accounting standards the company allocated revenue in a multiple element arrangement to each deliverable based on its relative fair value or for software elements based on vsoe if the fair value was not available for an undelivered element the revenue for the entire arrangement was deferred 

accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue based on historical experience and current conditions such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance billing adjustments and uncollectible account writeoffs are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the company’s consolidated results of operations 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in the “contingencies” section of this “mda” commencing on page 57 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company would record a material loss contingency in its financial statements if the loss is both probable of occurring and the loss can be reasonably estimated the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities 

goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment annually as of november 30 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with asc topic 350 these impairment indicators could include significant events or circumstances that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

at november 30 2011 the company had six primary reporting units one in mis that encompasses all of moody’s ratings operations and five reporting units within ma rda rms training csi and copal the rda reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools the rms reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software that is sold on a license or subscription basis as well as related advisory services for 

  

 implementation and maintenance the training reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training in november 2010 the company acquired csi which was analyzed separately as its own reporting unit for the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of november 30 2011 as the entity has not yet been integrated with one of the aforementioned ma reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2011 the company acquired copal which is deemed to be separate reporting unit at december 31 2011 additionally in december 2011 the company acquired bh which is part of the rms reporting unit 

in 2011 the fasb issued an asu which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before proceeding with a quantitative assessment the company has adopted the provisions of this asu and accordingly the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a threestep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level in the first step the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount if a determination is made that based on the qualitative factors an impairment does not exist the company is not required to perform further testing if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company must perform a third step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude on impairment using only a qualitative approach the company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and appropriate market comparables the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable however as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from these estimates in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit at the date when an acquisition is integrated into one of the established reporting units and is based on which reporting unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 

the company performed a qualitative analysis as of november 30 2011 on all reporting units excluding copal which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 and as such its purchase price represents the fair value of the net assets acquired the qualitative assessment considered the impact of various macroeconomic conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit that could impact future cash flows the most significant estimates in these qualitative assessments are projected results for each reporting unit and the wacc 

based upon the aforementioned qualitative assessment the company determined that for all of its reporting units excluding its training reporting unit it was not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount in addition to analyzing macroeconomic factors that could potentially impact the cash flows of the reporting units the company analyzed the growth rates and the wacc for each reporting unit noting that changes in the assumptions from those used as of november 30 2010 would be favorable to the reporting unit’s valuation accordingly no quantitative test was performed on these reporting units for the training reporting unit the company’s projected cash flows for this reporting unit were slightly lower than projected in 2010 primarily due to macroeconomic uncertainties in the us and emea as a result for the training reporting unit the company proceeded to step two of the impairment test more fully described above based on the result of this test the company does not believe that the goodwill relating to its training reporting unit is at risk of impairment as the fair value for the reporting unit is substantially in excess of its carrying value 

  

 the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december 31 2011 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of november 30 2010 for all reporting units excluding the training reporting unit for these reporting units the company has deemed their fair values at november 30 2010 to approximate their fair values at november 30 2011 based on the qualitative assessment described above the sensitivity analysis for the training reporting unit is shown as of november 30 2011 

 

  

 the following is a discussion regarding the company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units at november 30 2010 excluding the training reporting unit for which a quantitative test was performed as of november 30 2011 which was the last date that the company performed a quantitative test to assess the potential impairment of goodwill assumptions for deriving the fair value of the training reporting unit have been updated as of november 30 2011 this discussion excludes bh copal and csi which have not yet been subject to a full quantitative impairment analysis as of december 31 2011 due to the timing of the acquisitions of these entities 

the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology the results of the dcf were evaluated against comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples in order to assess the reasonableness of the dcf fair values the dcf analysis requires significant judgments regarding the derivation of fair value including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments 

the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology which requires significant management judgment 

 

   

  amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no such events or changes during 2011 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the company’s reporting units may not be recoverable this determination was made based on improving market conditions and an assessment of projected cash flows for all reporting units additionally there were no events or circumstances during 2011 that would indicate the need for an adjustment of the remaining useful lives of the company’s amortizable intangible assets 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its postretirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

 the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligation for its postretirement plans as of december 31 2011 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s postretirement plans 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise excluding differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets the company amortizes as a component of annual pension expense total outstanding gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets for moody’s postretirement plans the total losses as of december 31 2011 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 1197 million and moody’s expects to recognize net periodic benefit expense of 94 million in 2012 related to the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded us pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under asc topic 715 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2011 the company has an unrecognized asset loss of 136 million of which 93 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2012 expense 

  

 the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2012 operating income these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2012 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s postretirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  weighted average discount rates of 425 and 405 for pension plans and other postretirement plans respectively 

a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2012 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to postretirement plans will be 301 million in 2012 compared with 241 million in 2011 excluding the effect of pension settlement charges the expected expense increase in 2012 reflects the effects of higher benefit obligations primarily due to lower discount rate assumptions and higher amortization of actuarial losses 

stockbased compensation 

the company records compensation expense for all sharebased payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans stock options restricted stock and stock appreciation rights the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 

an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2011 dollars in millions 

 

 income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

moody’s is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

for utp’s asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

for certain of its foreign subsidiaries the company has deemed a portion of the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations accordingly the company has not provided deferred income taxes on these 

  

 indefinitely reinvested earnings a future distribution or change in assertion regarding reinvestment by the foreign subsidiaries relating to these earnings could result in additional tax liability for the company it is not practicable to determine the amount of the potential additional tax liability due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made

the company’s longterm debt including the current portion is recorded at cost except for the series 20051 notes which are carried at cost adjusted for the fair value of an interest rate swap used to hedge the fair value of the note the fair value and carrying value of the company’s longterm debt as of december 31 2011 and 2010 is as follows 

 

  

   

 the fair value of the company’s 2010 senior notes is based on quoted market prices the fair value of the remaining longterm debt which is not publicly traded is estimated using discounted cash flows based on prevailing interest rates available to the company for borrowings with similar maturities 

management may consider pursuing additional longterm financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations share repurchases and other strategic opportunities which would result in higher financing costs

for claims litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability is expected to be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate in other instances because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation regulatory enforcement and similar matters and contingencies particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also cannot predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve the pending matters referred to above progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition however in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them and the novel theories of law asserted an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic 740 of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

legacy tax matters 

moody’s continues to have exposure to potential liabilities arising from legacy tax matters as of december 31 2011 moody’s has recorded liabilities for legacy tax matters totaling 546 million this includes liabilities and accrued interest due to new db arising from the 2000 distribution agreement it is possible that the ultimate liability for legacy tax matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the company which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody’s future reported results financial position and cash flows 

the following summary of the relationships among moody’s new db and their predecessor entities is important in understanding the company’s exposure to the legacy tax matters 

in november 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation separated into three separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation acnielsen corporation and cognizant corporation in june 1998 the dun  bradstreet corporation separated into two separate public companies old db and rh donnelley corporation during 1998 cognizant separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated and nielsen media research inc in september 2000 old db separated into two separate public companies new db and moody’s 

old db and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities old db and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable irs determinations on certain tax matters and certain other potential tax liabilities all as described in such agreements further in connection with the 2000 distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement new db and moody’s have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to these legacy tax matters 

at the time of the 2000 distribution new db paid moody’s 550 million for 50 of certain anticipated future tax benefits through 2012 in the event that these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by new db or there is an irs audit of new db 

  

 impacting these tax benefits moody’s would be required to repay to new db an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits as well as its share of any tax liability incurred by new db in june 2011 the statute of limitations for new db relating to the 2004 tax year expired as a result in the second quarter of 2011 moody’s recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of 28 million 17 million net of tax and an increase in other nonoperating income of 64 million relating to amounts due to new db as of december 31 2011 moody’s liability with respect to this matter totaled 526 million 

additionally in april 2011 moody’s received a refund of 09 million 06 million net of tax for interest assessed related to prespinoff tax years coupled with the 64 million noted above and related interest of 17 million net legacy tax benefits were 87 million in the year ended december 31 2011 of which 7 million was deemed to be unusual in nature 

in 2005 settlement agreements were executed with the irs with respect to certain legacy tax matters related to the years 19891990 and 19931996 with respect to these settlements moody’s and new db believed that ims health and nmr did not pay their full share of the liability to the irs under the terms of the applicable separation agreements between the parties moody’s and new db subsequently paid these amounts to the irs and commenced arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr to resolve this dispute pursuant to these arbitration proceedings the company received 108 million 65 million as a reduction of interest expense and 43 million as a reduction of tax expense in 2009 the aforementioned settlement payment resulted in net income benefits of 82 million in 2009 the company continues to carry a 2 million liability for this matter 

in 2006 new db and moody’s each deposited 398 million with the irs in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years in 2007 new db and moody’s requested a return of that deposit the irs applied a portion of the deposit in satisfaction of an assessed deficiency and returned the balance to the company moody’s subsequently pursued a refund for a portion of the outstanding amount in may 2010 the irs refunded 52 million to the company for the 1997 tax year which included interest of approximately 25 million resulting in an aftertax benefit of 46 million

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly in terms of outstanding principal amount and types of securities or other obligations beginning in mid2007 there was a severe market disruption and decline in issuance activity for some significant asset classes of securities in the us and internationally despite the market disruption moody’s believes that the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued secular growth of fixedincome markets worldwide moody’s business prospects correspond closely to the health of the world’s major economies and capital markets throughout 2010 there were signs of recovery in the us economy while the global economy has been more volatile with european sovereign debt and related banking sector concerns offset by strong economic growth in emerging markets continued improvement of the us economy and housing sector specifically along with the stabilization of the european sovereign debt concerns should influence the company’s growth over the near term moody’s is well positioned to benefit from a longterm recovery in global credit market activity and a more informed use of credit ratings research and related analytical products in an environment of renewed attention to risk analysis and risk management moody’s expects that these developments will support continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions research data and risk management tools and services an expectation of recoverydriven growth in capital market activity supported by initiatives to increase market share leverage pricing opportunities capture disintermediation activity in developed and developing markets and develop additional data research and rating products represent key growth drivers for moody’s 

growth in global fixedincome markets is attributable to a number of forces and trends advances in information technology make information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world technology facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell which in the absence of the appropriate technology may not be easily obtainable this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and development of worldwide financial markets and a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk as a result existing capital markets have expanded and a number of new capital markets have emerged in addition more issuers and investors are accessing developed capital markets information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support moody’s continued expansion in developing markets 

another trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets recent credit market disruptions have slowed the trend of disintermediation globally but moody’s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems thus disintermediation is expected to accelerate in the longerterm with moody’s continuing to target investment and resources to growing international markets where disintermediation and bond issuance should remain more robust 

the strong growth trend seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid1990’s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010 the market disruptions that escalated in 2008 are expected to continue in the immediate term however moody’s expects to see some revenue stabilization from this market in the future despite significant declines from peak market levels moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global credit markets and provide opportunities for longer term revenue growth moody’s will continue to monitor this market and adapt to meet the changing needs of its participants 

rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the dollarequivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets mis’s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and the prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decision process however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings subscriptionbased research and other areas partially mitigate mis’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global capital markets 

moody’s operations are also subject to various risks inherent in conducting business internationally such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources however the formation of for example a new governmentsponsored regional or global rating agency would pose a risk to mis’s growth prospects management believes that this risk compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry is relatively low because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required with uncertainty about the likelihood of financial success for the entity 

  

 legislative bodies and regulators in the us europe and selective other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of cras which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of mis or increased costs of doing business for mis therefore in order to broaden the potential for expansion of nonratings services moody’s reorganized in january 2008 into two distinct businesses mis consisting solely of the ratings business and ma ma conducts all nonratings activities including the sale of credit research produced by mis and the production and sale of other economic and creditrelated products and services the reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by ma into activities which may have otherwise been restricted for mis due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities 

ma expects to benefit from the growing demand among credit market participants for information that enables them to make sound investment and risk management decisions these customers require advanced qualitative and quantitative tools to support their management of increasingly complex capital market instruments such complexity creates analytical challenges for market participants including financial intermediaries asset managers and other investors in recent years reliable thirdparty ratings and research served to supplement or substitute for traditional inhouse research as the scale geographic scope and complexity of financial markets grew ma remains focused on driving improvements in customer retention product placements and new customer acquisition in this area credit market conditions improved in 2010 helping to raise customer retention level after a period of higher than normal customer attrition in ma 

growth in ma is also expected as financial institutions adopt active credit portfolio management practices and implement internal credit assessment tools for compliance with basel ii regulations ma offers products that respond to these needs this growth will be realized by for example the development of new private firm default probability models for specific countries and by expanding analysis capabilities of new asset classes 

the 2010 acquisition of csi global education inc canada’s leading provider of financial learning credentials and certification strengthens ma’s capabilities for delivering credit training programs and represents another means for the company to pursue its objectives of enhancing risk management practices furthering financial education and promoting efficiency in the capital markets 

competition 

the mis business competes with other cras and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research many users of mis’s ratings also have inhouse credit research capabilities moody’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp’s while in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp mis’s competitors include fitch dominion bond rating service ltd of canada am best company inc japan credit rating agency ltd rating and investment information inc of japan and eganjones ratings company in 2008 two more firms were granted the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations status in the us lace financial corp and realpoint llc in 2010 these two firms were acquired by kroll bond rating agency inc and morningstar inc respectively to enable them to compete as nrsros additional rating agencies may emerge in the us as the sec continues to expand the number of nrsros other competition may arise in the us from credit opinion providers who do not operate as nrsro’s such as bloomberg competition may also increase in developed or developing markets outside the us over the next few years as the number of rating agencies may increase although a more regulated credit ratings industry both in the us and internationally may provide for a less appealing expansion opportunity 

the increased regulatory focus on credit risk presents both opportunities and challenges for moody’s global demand for credit ratings and risk management services may rise but regulatory actions may result in a greater number of rating agencies andor additional regulation of moody’s and its competitors alternatively banking or securities market regulators could seek to reduce the use of ratings in regulations thereby reducing certain elements of demand for ratings or otherwise seek to control the analysis or business of rating agencies 

credit rating agencies such as mis also compete with other means of managing credit risk such as credit insurance competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk also may pose a competitive threat to moody’s 

ma competes broadly in the financial information space against diversified competitors such as thomsonreuters bloomberg riskmetrics sp fitch dun  bradstreet and markit group among others ma’s main competitors within rda include sp fitch algorithmics creditsights thomsonreuters intex ihs global insight blackrock solutions and other smaller boutique providers of fixed income analytics valuations economic data and research in rms ma faces competition from fitch algorithmics sungard sas oracle and other various smaller vendors and inhouse solutions within professional services ma competes with oliver wyman for certain credit risk advisory services with omega performance dc gardner and a host of boutique providers for financial training 

  

 moody’s strategy 

moody’s continues to follow growth strategies that adapt to market conditions and capitalize on emerging opportunities 

given recent market turmoil moody’s immediate focus is on making effective business decisions to adapt to challenging economic market and regulatory conditions while positioning the company to benefit from gradual recovery in global credit market activity 

given the renewed attention to risk analysis and risk management moody’s is committed to further encouraging the informed use of credit ratings research and related analytics products 

moody’s seeks to differentiate itself from incumbent and potential competitors with predictive uniquely thoughtful and forwardlooking opinions about credit and the credit industry 

adapting to market changes is a key factor in maintaining market relevance moody’s continuously monitors opportunities to selectively diversify its revenue base through organic growth and acquisitions in order to replace areas of lost revenue and position the company for new sources of business 

in support of those goals moody’s intends to continue its focus in the following areas 

expansion in financial centers 

moody’s serves its customers through its global network of offices and business affiliations moody’s currently maintains comprehensive rating and commercial operations in financial centers including beijing buenos aires dubai frankfurt hong kong london madrid mexico city milan moscow new york paris sao paolo seoul singapore sydney tokyo and toronto moody’s expects that its global network will position it to benefit from the expansion of worldwide capital markets and thereby increase revenue moody’s also expects that the growth of its mis business in europe will return once there is clarity on the resolution of the european sovereign debt crisis additionally moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures this will allow moody’s to extend its credit opinion franchise to local and regional obligors through domestic currency ratings and national scale ratings 

new rating products 

moody’s continues to respond to investor demand for new products and enhancements in the recent market turmoil attention to core strengths has been crucial and enhancements have and continue to be focused on quality and transparency given the particular disruption in the structured finance markets mis has been developing enhanced structured finance offerings to meet investor demands for more information content leveraging the diversity of its research data and analytics moody’s has introduced crosssector analysis to better illustrate the broader impacts of recent market events this is further enhanced by the incorporation of macroeconomics to frame conditions and assumptions mis continues to capitalize on market developments and enhance ratings surveillance efficiency focusing on new ratings products and to identify design develop and maintain valueadded research analytics and data products serving the capital markets 

internetenhanced products and services 

moody’s is expanding its use of the internet and other electronic media to enhance customer service the company’s website provides the public with instant access to ratings and provides the public and subscribers with credit research and risk assessment tools internet delivery also enables moody’s to provide services to more individuals within a customer organization and to offer highervalue services because of more timely delivery moody’s expects that access to these applications will increase customer use of the company’s services moody’s expects to continue to invest in electronic media to capitalize on these and other opportunities 

expansion of credit research products and investment analytic tools 

moody’s plans to expand its research and analytic services through internal development and potentially through acquisitions most new product initiatives are more analytical and dataintensive than traditional narrative research offerings such services address investor interest in replicating the types of monitoring activities conducted by moody’s analysts and provide the means for customers to gain access to raw data and financial statistics and ratios used by mis in the rating process for municipalities companies and financial institutions these products represent important sources of growth for ma’s rda business ma is developing products in the fixedincome valuations and pricing arena that facilitate price transparency in global fixed income markets especially for complex structured securities and derivative instruments moreover moody’s continues to pursue opportunities to extend its research relevance in new domestic or regional markets eg china as well as new functional markets eg hedge funds 

new quantitative credit risk assessment services 

moody’s will continue to provide banks and other institutions with quantitative credit risk assessment solutions the company believes that there will be increased demand for such services because they assist customers trading or holding creditsensitive assets to better manage risk and deliver better performance also international bank regulatory authorities are assessing the 

  

 adequacy of banks’ internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining regulatory capital the acquisition of fermat in 2008 accelerated moody’s capabilities in this area such regulatory initiatives create demand for and encourage adoption of related services by banks from thirdparty providers 

regulation 

in the us since 1975 mis has been designated as an nrsro by the sec the sec first applied the nrsro designation in that year to companies whose credit ratings could be used by brokerdealers for purposes of determining their net capital requirements since that time congress the sec and other governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of nrsros to distinguish between “investmentgrade” and “noninvestmentgrade” securities among other purposes 

in september 2006 the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 was passed which created a voluntary registration process for rating agencies wishing to be designated as nrsros the reform act provided the sec with authority to oversee nrsros while prohibiting the sec from regulating the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any nrsro determines credit ratings in june 2007 the sec published its first set of rules implementing the reform act these rules address the nrsro application and registration process as well as oversight rules related to recordkeeping financial reporting prevention of misuse of material nonpublic information conflicts of interest and prohibited acts and practices in february 2009 the sec published a second set of rules applicable to nrsros the majority of which provide requirements for managing conflicts of interest enhancing record keeping requirements and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies in november 2009 the sec published a third set of final rules for nrsros these rules which came into force in june 2010 require additional disclosure of rating histories and prohibit nrsros from rating structured finance products unless the issuer makes the same information accessible to all nrsros that it provides to an nrsro hired to determine the rating in 2009 the sec also determined to eliminate references to nrsro ratings in certain regulations retain some references and seek additional comments on other references 

mis has been registered as an nrsro with the sec under the exchange act as of september 2007 and as of that time mis has been subject to the sec’s oversight rules described above as required by the rules mis has made its form nrsro initial application its annual certification of form nrsro and any associated updates publicly available by posting it on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was signed into law on july 21 2010 the subtitle of the financial reform act that addresses the cra industry is title ix subtitle c this subtitle seeks among other things to enhance transparency and accountability in the credit rating agency industry and to reduce the regulatory reliance on credit ratings the majority of the provisions of subtitle c of title ix of the financial reform act seek to regulate the activities of those cras that are registered under the sec’s regulatory framework for nrsros therefore these provisions will apply to any cras in mis’s corporate family that fall under the nrsro regime 

provisions of the financial reform act applicable to nrsros include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

 certain of the above mentioned provisions were effective immediately these include provisions that potentially impact cras’ liability environment the enhanced regulatory regime for cras could potentially increase the costs associated with the operation of a cra and increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings moreover it is possible that the number of legal proceedings especially as related to future ratings may increase materially and the potential exposure of cras thereunder may also increase it is possi 

  

 ble that implementing changes to the company’s operations to address the changed liability environment may result in lower revenues andor increased expenses and may significantly change the manner in which the company conducts its credit rating business 

the majority of the provisions in the financial reform act as it pertains to cras are to be implemented through rulemaking by the sec and other regulatory authorities the sec has published a schedule for its rule making activity over the coming year and it appears that the majority of the rulemaking as it pertains to the cra industry will be conducted and completed in the first half of 2011 specifically the sec has indicated that it expects to propose various rules for nrsros to implement the relevant provisions of the financial reform act before the end of march 2011 one provision that the sec has already implemented in accordance with the mandated timeline under the financial reform act is the elimination of the specific exemption from regulation fair disclosure for information provided by issuers to cras for the purpose of developing a rating 

in addition the sec has several pending rule proposals on cras including 1 a rule proposal to require disclosure about credit ratings when ratings are used in connection with the sale of registered securities 2 a rule proposal regarding the nrsro compliance function and disclosure about revenues received for credit rating services and 3 rule proposals regarding structured finance regulations in january 2011 the sec adopted a rule which will come into effect on september 26 2011 requiring nrsros to disclose information about the representations and warranties of the structured finance securities they rate the bank regulators also have begun their rule making activities and in october 2010 they closed a comment period requesting views from market participants on alternatives to credit ratings that could be incorporated into banking supervision mis and ma both provided comments and these can be found on the company’s website 

finally as part of the ongoing debate surrounding the financial crisis mis participated in a hearing held by the financial crisis inquiry commission “fcic” on june 2 2010 the fcic’s report and two dissenting opinions were published on january 27 2011 

internationally several regulatory developments have occurred 

the g8 and the g20—in november 2008 the heads of state of the g20 reached agreement on a wideranging set of proposals to better regulate financial systems among other things the g20 committed to implement oversight of the cras consistent with the strengthened international organization of securities commissions’ code of conduct see below and agreed that in the medium term the countries should implement a registration system for cras the g20 also committed to formulate their regulations and other measures in a consistent manner and recommended that iosco review cras’ adoption of the standards and mechanisms for monitoring compliance on april 2 2009 the g20 heads of state meeting was held in london where the g20 provided a sixpart action plan to address the financial crisis 1 to restore confidence growth and jobs 2 to repair the financial system to restore lending 3 to strengthen financial regulation and rebuild trust 4 to fund and reform international financial institutions to overcome the current crisis and prevent future ones 5 to promote global trade and investment and reject protectionism and 6 to build an inclusive green and sustainable recovery the g20’s plan also contains a number of provisions that are specific to cras in particular the g20 member states agreed to extend regulatory oversight to and require registration of cras in order to ensure that they adhere to the international code of good practice on july 10 2009 the g8 restated its commitment to implement the g20’s statement 

in september 2009 the g20 met in pittsburgh and developed a progress report on actions to promote global financial regulatory reform with respect to cras the g20 acknowledged that stronger oversight regimes for cras have been developed in the eu the us and japan and recognized that the development of good practices for due diligence by asset managers investing in structured finance products will result in reduced reliance on credit ratings the g20 also expressed concern about the creation of globally inconsistent regulations 

more recently on october 23 2010 the g20 finance ministers and central bank governors met in seoul korea in preparation for the november 2010 meeting of the g20 heads of state broadly the finance ministers and central bank governors have agreed to continue to work in cooperation with one another in advance of this meeting the international monetary fund imf and the financial stability board fsb published a report and a statement respectively with the fsb publishing a more detailed report on october 27 2010 as pertaining to cras both institutions advocate that governments reduce their reliance on credit ratings in regulation while both entities acknowledge that the process will take time they believe that the mechanistic use of ratings by governments should over time be discontinued 

iosco—in december 2004 the technical committee of iosco published its code of conduct fundamentals for credit rating agencies in may 2008 iosco published the revised iosco code the changes made to the iosco code broadly address greater transparency of methodologies and processes by cras in july 2008 iosco also announced that it will monitor the cras implementation of the iosco code changes and it will explore the means by which iosco members might work together to verify the proper and complete disclosure by cras of information required by the iosco code 

on march 12 2009 iosco published its second review of the cras implementation of the iosco code the report noted that seven out of the 21 cras reviewed had implemented the iosco code in their own codes of conduct in particular mis was found to have substantially implemented the 2008 revisions to the iosco code in addition iosco announced the establishment of a new standing committee that will address global issues regarding the cra industry 

  

 mis has revised its code of professional conduct fashioned on the iosco code on several occasions to reflect the changes made to the iosco code and the broader changes in the regulatory environment for cras beginning in 2006 mis has annually published a report that describes its implementation of its code the mis code and implementation reports can be found on the company’s website 

eu—in late april 2009 the european parliament voted and passed a new regulation “eu regulation” that establishes an oversight regime for the cra industry in the european union the framework for the eu regulation requires the registration formal regulation and periodic inspection of cras operating in the eu the eu regulation also sets out specific requirements for the use of ratings that are produced outside of the eu and used for regulatory purposes in the eu among these is a requirement for the relevant competent authority in the eu and the competent authority of the noneu jurisdiction where that rating has been produced to enter into a cooperation agreement containing provisions related to the exchange of information and the coordination of supervisory activities at this time it is too early to give a more precise assessment of the impact of the eu regulation on mis the company expects that there will be increases in our operational and compliance costs on a onetime and recurring basis in addition the european securities and market authority esma was established in january 2011 and will have direct supervisory responsibility for the cra industry in the eu it is expected to be fully operational by june 2011 also the regulatory framework of the cra industry continues to be discussed in the european union the european commission recently published a consultation document on the need for additional measures to supervise the cra industry and the european parliament is debating and modifying an own initiative report on the topic mis’s response to the commission’s consultation document can be found on the company’s website among the issues being debated are the issuerpay business model use of ratings in regulation sovereign ratings competition and cras’ liability environment it is expected that in the near future the european commission will publish a proposal for additional regulation that will consider some or all of these topics 

the basel committee—in june 2004 the basel committee on banking supervision published a bank capital adequacy framework called basel ii to replace its initial 1988 framework under basel ii ratings assigned by recognized cras or ecais can be used by banks in determining credit risk weights for many of their institutional credit exposures recognized ecais could be subject to a broader range of oversight national authorities have begun the ecai recognition process mis has been recognized as an ecai in several jurisdictions and the recognition process is ongoing in many others as a result of the recent developments in the financial markets the banking authorities of the basel committee have been reconsidering the overall framework work on the new framework basel iii substantially has been completed it is to be implemented in stages beginning in 2010 and concluding in 2018 basel iii continues to use credit ratings as a tool in bank supervision 

other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future in addition in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which mis operates the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of mis cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

 item 1a   risk factors tableend the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occur moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry are rapidly evolving and may negatively impact the nature and economics of the company’s business 

credit rating agencies are regulated in both the us and in other countries including by state and local authorities over the past few years many jurisdictions have adopted or proposed new laws and regulations that impact the operation of credit rating agencies and the markets for securities that are rated additional laws and regulations have been proposed or are being considered and further legislation or regulation may be proposed or implemented in the future some of the more prominent developments are discussed below or under the section entitled “regulation” in part i item 1 of this form 10k these laws and regulations are intended to cause or may result in increased competition in the credit rating business in addition these laws or regulations may cause or result in i alternatives to credit ratings ii regulations or restrictions on how information is used in the development or maintenance of credit ratings iii increased regulatory oversight of the credit markets and credit rating agency operation or iv changes in the pricing of credit ratings all of these items could result in an increase in costs that moody’s may not be able to pass through to customers and a decrease in the demand for or changes in the use of credit ratings 

new pleading and liability standards that have been adopted in the us and proposed elsewhere potentially subject credit rating agencies to a greater number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities could result in such legal proceedings continuing for a greater period of time before being resolved and could result in increased uncertainty over and exposure to liability of credit rating agencies as new laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies rapidly evolve the costs of compliance is expected to increase and moody’s may not be able to pass on these costs through the pricing of its services in addition there may be greater uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of new laws and regulations which may increase compliance costs and increase the possibility of fines penalties or other sanctions including restrictions on activities being imposed 

given the comparatively recent adoption and the number of additional reforms that have been or will be adopted including those under the legislative and regulatory initiatives discussed below moody’s is unable to accurately assess the future impact of any regulatory changes that may result or the impact on moody’s competitive position or its current practices although these recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally they may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner responding to these developments will increase moody’s fixed and variable costs of operations perhaps to a degree that is significantly greater than moody’s currently expects and moody’s may not be able to pass through or otherwise recoup such costs these developments may alter mis’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which mis’s ratings are developed assigned and communicated and decrease demand or affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate and alter the economics of the credit ratings business including by restricting or mandating the business models under which a rating agency is permitted to operate moody’s stock price may also be affected by speculation regarding legislative and regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on moody’s business and by increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which moody’s operates in ways that cannot presently be predicted 

in the us mis is designated as an nrsro pursuant to sec regulations adopted under the reform act one of the central tenets of the reform act was to encourage competition among rating agencies the reform act established standards for the sec to have direct jurisdiction over credit rating agencies that seek nrsro status and to inspect their operations 

in the us one of the tenets of the recently enacted financial reform act is that credit rating agencies perform a “gatekeeper” role and should be subject to enhanced oversight standards that could result in enhanced liability the financial reform act amends a number of laws and regulations requires the sec to adopt a number of rules affecting rating agencies and the use of credit ratings especially in structured finance markets and authorizes a number of studies relating to the operations and legal standards applicable to cras provisions of the financial reform act and other rules that may be adopted by the sec in furtherance of the financial reform act that pose risks to the company’s business include among others 

 

  

  

   

   

  

 the financial reform act rescission of rule 436g under the securities act which was an exemption from expert liability under the securities act for ratings information included in registration statements could impact moody’s in a number of ways sec rules relating to offerings of assetbacked securities that are registered with the sec require certain disclosures regarding credit ratings if as is common in the market for such securities the issuance or sale of any class of such assetbacked securities is conditioned on the assignment of a rating by one or more rating agencies as a result of the repeal of rule 436g under the securities act and accordingly the imposition of a heightened liability standard that would result from such disclosures mis and other credit rating agencies have declined to consent to issuers of such securities making such disclosures regarding their ratings the staff of the sec has informally advised issuers of assetbacked securities that pending further review of rulemaking required under the financial reform act the sec staff will not recommend enforcement action if an issuer omits the ratings disclosure required by sec rules for registered offerings of assetbacked securities if the sec staff position were reversed or if sec rules otherwise were adopted or applied in a manner that resulted in rating agencies being subject to heightened standards of liability in such offerings it could adversely impact the volume of securities sold in such offerings demand for mis’s ratings the pricing structure for ratings issued by mis andor moody’s exposure to liability and could have other effects that moody’s is not able to predict any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

in addition in october 2009 the sec proposed a rule providing that if credit ratings are used in connection with an offering of any other type of security that is registered under the securities act which as proposed would include use of a credit rating for certain unregistered securities offerings that are subsequently subject to a registered exchange offer the ratings must be included in the registration statement if adopted this proposal coupled with the financial reform act’s rescission of rule 436g would mean that common practices used in the us to market and sell securities in such offerings would have to be altered unless mis or other credit rating agencies consented to subject themselves to expert liability provisions of the securities act with respect to their credit ratings adoption of this or a similar rule could impact the volume of securities sold in such offerings demand for mis’s ratings the pricing structure for ratings issued by mis andor moody’s exposure to liability and could have other effects that moody’s is not able to predict any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

both the g8 and the g20 have sought to analyze and arrive at a consistent approach for addressing the various areas of the financial market and have made a variety of recommendations as to regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings specifically the g20 has also agreed to require the registration of rating agencies in their home jurisdiction as a result of the internationally coordinated approach countries other than the us which as noted above had already adopted a registration regime for nrsros have begun the process of implementing registration regimes for the oversight of cras in particular the eu adopted a new regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the eu the regulation seeks to introduce a common eu regulatory approach to the oversight of cras its primary objective is to enhance the integrity transparency responsibility governance and reliability of credit rating activities by establishing conditions for the issuance of credit ratings and rules on the organization and conduct of credit rating agencies including restrictions on certain activities that are deemed to create a conflict of interest and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments the regulation became fully effective on september 6 2010 mis applied for registration in august 2010 

in addition the european securities and market authority has been formed which is expected to be fully operational in june 2011 and will have direct supervisory authority for cras in the eu 

the european commission has also published a consultation paper that discusses 

 

  

  

  

  

 the eu parliament is working on its own report discussing a number of these issues 

  

 the foregoing initiatives if implemented and depending on their terms could negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability ability to compete or the markets for its products and services in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict in particular exposure to increased liability under future eu regulation may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely affect moody’s results of operations 

in addition to the foregoing in the wake of the credit crisis legislative and regulatory bodies in both the us and in other countries have adopted or are studying or pursuing new laws and regulations addressing cras and the use of credit ratings particularly in the area of structured finance securities and the role of cras leading up to the credit crisis 

moody’s believes that there is still the potential for additional rulemaking that can significantly impact moody’s business it is likely that other jurisdictions will adopt additional laws or regulations affecting moody’s operations or the markets for its products and services this could include adopting regulations that affect the need for debt securities to be rated establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings however moody’s cannot predict the extent of the regulations that may be implemented or the effect that they may have on moody’s operations or the potential for increased exposure to liability 

exposure to litigation related to moody’s rating opinions 

moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities as part of ongoing investigations following the credit crisis and is responding to those inquiries in addition moody’s faces a greater amount of litigation than has historically been the case from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions as well as other related business practices due to the difficult economic times and turbulent markets over the last several years the market value of creditdependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased significantly increasing the number of legal proceedings including investigations moody’s is currently facing these proceedings impose additional expenses on the company which may increase over time as these matters progress procedurally require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues and given the number of these proceedings present a greater risk that moody’s may be subject to fines or damages if moody’s is deemed to have violated any laws or regulations in jurisdictions outside the us these types of proceedings may increase or become more costly because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that currently exist in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as provided by the first amendment and may pose a greater risk of criminal rather than civil penalties these risks often are and may continue to be difficult to assess or quantify moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time furthermore to the extent that moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals from the various litigation at an early stage and matters proceed to trial the aggregate legal defense costs to be incurred by moody’s could increase substantially regardless of the ultimate outcome 

in addition as discussed above the financial reform act revised pleading and liability standards and other provisions potentially subjecting cras to increased liability under securities law claims the financial reform act and regulations that will be adopted as a result of it may result in a material increase in the number of legal proceedings especially as related to future ratings and together with judicial decisions under the financial reform act and under preexisting legal standards may increase the potential legal exposure of cras changes in liability standards applicable in markets outside the us also could create a greater potential for liability from operating in such markets the company believes that adoption of these provisions could negatively impact credit markets including causing cras to cease to issue ratings on certain securities or issuers increasing the cost of ratings delaying issuances of ratings and restricting the public availability of ratings which changes could materially negatively impact the company’s business and prospects it is possible that implementing changes to the company’s operations to address the changed pleading and liability standards may result in lower revenues andor increased expenses that the company may not be able to recoup or offset which could be material and the company may not be successful in avoiding or mitigating the impact of the heightened or changed pleading and liability standards 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets 

approximately 57 of mis’s revenue for 2010 was transactionbased compared to 50 of mis’s revenue in 2009 and 49 of mis’s revenue in 2008 revenue from rating transactions is dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets accordingly any conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollarequivalent volume of debt issuances for which mis provides ratings services and thereby have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings 

a significant disruption in world financial markets particularly in the credit markets began in mid2007 when many credit markets experienced a severe lack of liquidity this disruption continues to be felt as the markets gradually recover credit market disruptions together with an economic slowdown have negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings notwithstanding a strong increase in debt issuances in the corporate financial institutions and us public finance sectors in 2010 future debt issuances could be negatively affected by a sharp increase in longterm interest rates or factors which cause instability or volatility in the global capital markets new debt issuances in the structured finance market are likely to con 

  

 tinue to be significantly below peak levels reached in the middle of the past decade consequently the company has experienced a reduction in the overall demand for rating newly issued debt securities changes in the markets for such securities and in the role and regulation of rating agencies may materially adversely affect the company even if the volume of securities issuances in all sectors recovers to or exceeds those experienced prior to 2007 

the timing nature extent and sustainability of any recovery in the credit and other financial markets remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that overall market conditions will improve in the future that recent improvements will be sustained or that moody’s financial results will not continue to be adversely affected a sustained period of market decline or weakness especially if it relates to credit sensitive securities for which there was historically a high level of demand for ratings could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business and financial results initiatives that the company has undertaken to reduce costs may not be sufficient and further cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the near term due in part to rent technology compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further the costreduction initiatives undertaken to date could result in strains in the company’s operations if the credit markets and demand for ratings in all sectors return to levels that prevailed prior to mid2007 or otherwise unexpectedly increase other factors that could further reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities include increases in interest rates or credit spreads continued volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment significant regulatory political or economic events the use of alternative sources of credit including financial institutions and government sources defaults of significant issuers and other unfavorable market and economic conditions 

furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional credit rating agencies such as mis changing regulatory considerations and other market developments could negatively affect the demand for credit ratings even if debt security issuances and activities increase as such no assurance can be given as to the amount of revenues that may be derived therefrom 

legal economic and regulatory risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions 

moody’s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the us in addition to the regulatory risks discussed above operations in different countries expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into us dollars and currency fluctuations us laws affecting overseas operations including domestic and foreign export and import restrictions tariffs and other trade barriers political and economic instability the possibility of nationalization expropriation price controls and other restrictive governmental actions longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables and potentially adverse tax consequences 

in its nonus operations moody’s is subject to regulations applicable under the office of foreign asset control the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and other anticorruption laws that generally prohibit us companies and their intermediaries from offering promising authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials which may include companies affiliated with foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business violations of the fcpa and other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the sec and us department of justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the fcpa internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that the company has implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting its employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing its policies and the law if moody’s employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing its international operations the company may face investigations prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties administrative remedies and criminal sanctions any determination that the company has violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on moody’s financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions 

in addition to competition from other rating agencies that operate in a number of international jurisdictions and specialized companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company inc with respect to the insurance industry in many foreign countries mis competes with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence and greater familiarity or a longer operating history in those markets these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions that mis does not receive putting mis at a competitive disadvantage 

increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service as well as increased competition from nonnrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors at the same time bankruptcies and consolidation of customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of customers while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and service if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors moody’s may lose market share in addition one of the central goals of the reform act was to encourage competition among rating agencies the formation of additional nrsros may increase pricing as well as other competitive pressures 

  

 exposure to reputational and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation is one of the key bases on which the company competes to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors has suffered a loss in credibility in the course of the credit crisis or in the future suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be adversely affected factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities by a particular rating agency the timing and nature of changes in ratings adverse publicity as to the ratings process a major compliance failure publicity associated with ongoing litigation and new laws and regulations and increased criticism by users of ratings regulators and legislative bodies these concerns may be disclosed or highlighted in the course of various investigations or lawsuits that have been or may be instituted through legislative or regulatory hearings or special studies that are mandated by legislation or through journalists or others attempting to chronicle or report on the recent credit crisis 

introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies 

the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are highly competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and to utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by moody’s customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and its growth prospects in addition moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by limitations of its information technologies that fail to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors 

significant amount of intangible assets 

moody’s has a significant amount of intangible assets on its balance sheet consisting of 4655 million of goodwill and 1688 million of amortizable intangible assets approximately 98 of these intangibles reside in the ma business and are allocated to the four reporting units within ma rda rms training and csi failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in one or all of these reporting units could result in an asset impairment charge which would reduce net income in the period the impairment is recorded impairment of goodwill or intangibles would result in a noncash charge to operating expenses an impairment would be recorded if the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group which holds goodwill or any intangible assets is less than the carrying amount of its net assets a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group is its projected cash flows future cash flows of ma are dependent on a variety of factors such as but not limited to general economic growth capital market activity product innovation pricing market share and competition changes in these factors or in the conduct of moody’s operations in response to such factors could lead to reduced cash flows resulting in an asset impairment charge 

possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures 

moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting retaining and motivating highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering higher compensation than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis 

the trading price of moody’s stock could be affected by third party actions 

ownership of moody’s stock is highly concentrated with a majority of shares held by a few institutional stockholders due to this concentrated stockholder base the trading price of moody’s stock could be affected considerably by actions of significant stockholders to increase or decrease their positions in moody’s stock 

moody’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located including having its headquarters in new york city and offices in major cities worldwide this may include a disruption involving electrical communications or other services used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business whether due to human error natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage computer viruses intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism or war or otherwise moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of major operating systems may not be successful the company does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations their ability to service and 

  

 interact with moody’s clients and customers may suffer the company’s operations also rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks the business relies upon and processes a great deal of data through its systems the quality of which must be maintained in order for the business units to perform protective measures that moody’s takes may be circumvented or may not be sufficient to guard its computer systems software and networks from unauthorized access computer viruses or other malicious events that could have a security impact if one or more of such events occur this could jeopardize moody’s or its clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through its computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s its clients’ its counterparties’ or third parties’ operations moody’s may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures and the company may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by moody’s

following the events in the us subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly over the last several years mis and other credit rating agencies are the subject of intense scrutiny increased regulation ongoing investigation and civil litigation legislative regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are considering additional legislation regulation and enforcement actions including with respect to mis’s compliance with newly imposed regulatory standards moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other governmental authorities and is responding to such investigations and inquiries 

in addition the company is facing litigation from market participants relating to the performance of mis rated securities although moody’s in the normal course experiences such litigation the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased in the current economic environment

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moody’s corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

this mda contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” commencing on page 56 and item 1a “risk factors” commencing on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties risks and other factors associated with these statements 

the company 

moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings ii credit and economic related research data and analytical tools iii risk management software and iv quantitative credit risk measures credit portfolio management solutions training and financial credentialing and certification services moody’s operates in two reportable segments mis and ma 

mis the credit rating agency publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors 

the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets within its rda business ma distributes investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies and commentary on topical credit related events the rda business also produces and provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores within its rms business ma provides both economic and regulatory capital risk management software solutions within its professional services business it provides quantitative credit risk measures credit portfolio management solutions training and financial credentialing and certification services 

beginning in january 2008 moody’s segments were changed to reflect the reorganization announced in august 2007 as a result of the reorganization the rating agency is reported in the mis segment and several ratings business lines were realigned all of moody’s other nonrating commercial activities are represented in the ma segment 

as part of the reorganization there were several realignments within the mis lobs sovereign and subsovereign ratings which were previously part of financial institutions infrastructureutilities ratings which were previously part of corporate finance and project finance which was previously part of structured finance were combined with the public finance business to form a new lob called public project and infrastructure finance in addition real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business furthermore in august 2008 the global managed investments ratings group previously part of the structured finance business was combined with the financial institutions business 

in 2008 within ma various aspects of the legacy mis research business and mkmv business were combined to form the subscriptions software and professional services businesses the subscriptions business included credit and economic research data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk securities pricing and valuation software products and the professional services business included advisory services associated with risk modeling credit scorecard development and other specialized analytical projects as well as credit training and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a perengagement basis subscription services are typically sold for an initial 12month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods 

in 2009 the aforementioned ma businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit structure for the ma segment pursuant to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed research data and analytics and the software business was renamed risk management software the revised groupings classify certain subscriptionbased risk management software revenue and advisory services relating to software sales to the redefined rms business in november 2010 moody’s purchased csi which is currently a reporting unit within ma and for which revenues are reported within the professional services lob 

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis 

  

 moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets restructuring liabilities pension and other postretirement benefits utbs and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable 

in october 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200913 “multipledeliverable revenue arrangements” “asu 200913” the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of each deliverable the company has elected to early adopt asu 200913 on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified on or after january 1 2010 if applied in the same manner to the year ended december 31 2009 asu 200913 would not have had a material impact on net revenue reported for both its mis and ma segments in terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition the adoption of asu 200913 did not have a significant effect on the company’s net revenue in the period of adoption and is also not expected to have a significant effect on the company’s net revenue in periods after the initial adoption when applied to multiple element arrangements based on the currently anticipated business volume and pricing 

for 2010 and future periods pursuant to the guidance of asu 200913 when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available third party evidence if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 

the company’s products and services will generally continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under asu 200913 the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control in instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit 

the company determines whether its selling price in a multielement transaction meets the vsoe criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately in instances where the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range or only having a limited sales history the company attempts to establish tpe for deliverables the company determines whether tpe exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers however due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing possible differences in the company’s market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the company may contain a significant level of differentiation andor customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained the company generally is unable to reliably determine tpe based on the selling price hierarchy established by asu 200913 when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe the company will establish an esp esp is the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis the company establishes its best estimate of esp considering internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives standalone sales prices of similar products percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service and customer segment and geography additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend the company reviews its determination of vsoe tpe and esp on an annual basis or more frequently as needed 

in the mis segment revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed generally one year in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities derivatives international residential mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities which ranged from two to 51 years at december 31 2010 at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately 76 million 78 million and 82 million respectively 

multiple element revenue arrangements in the mis segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service beginning january 1 2010 in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort fees are allo 

  

 cated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees the company generally uses esp in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for initial ratings prior to january 1 2010 and pursuant to the previous accounting standards for these types of arrangements the initial rating fee was first allocated to the monitoring service determined based on the estimated fair market value of monitoring services with the residual amount allocated to the initial rating under asu 200913 this practice can no longer be used for nonsoftware deliverables upon the adoption of asu 200913 

mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 accounts receivable included approximately 25 million 27 million and 34 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 

in the ma segment products and services offered by the company include software licenses and related maintenance subscriptions and professional services revenue from subscription based products such as research and data subscriptions and certain softwarebased credit risk management subscription products is recognized ratably over the related subscription period which is principally one year revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period revenue from services rendered within the professional services line of business is generally recognized as the services are performed if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs 

products and services offered within the ma segment are sold either standalone or together in various combinations in instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and nonsoftware deliverables revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above 

if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using vsoe in the instances where the company is not able to determine vsoe for all of the deliverables of an arrangement the company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its vsoe and the residual revenue to the delivered elements if the company is unable to determine vsoe for an undelivered element the company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the company has delivered all of the elements or when vsoe has been determined for the undelivered elements 

prior to january 1 2010 and pursuant to the previous accounting standards the company allocated revenue in a multiple element arrangement to each deliverable based on its relative fair value or for software elements based on vsoe if the fair value was not available for an undelivered element the revenue for the entire arrangement was deferred 

accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue based on historical experience and current conditions such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance billing adjustments and uncollectible account writeoffs are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the company’s consolidated results of operations 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in the “contingencies” section of this “mda” commencing on page 54 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where 

  

 deemed appropriate the company would record a material loss contingency in its financial statements if the loss is both probable of occurring and the loss can be reasonably estimated the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities 

goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment annually as of november 30 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with asc topic 350 these impairment indicators could include significant events or circumstances that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

at november 30 2010 the company had five primary reporting units one in mis that encompasses all of moody’s ratings operations and four reporting units within ma rda rms training and csi the rda reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools the rms reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software that is sold on a license or subscription basis as well as related advisory services for implementation and maintenance the training reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training additionally in november 2010 the company acquired csi which was tested separately as its own reporting unit for the annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2010 csi is canada’s leading provider of financial learning credentials and certification 

the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a twostep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level as required by asc topic 350 “intangibles—goodwill and other” in the first step the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company must perform a second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and appropriate market comparables the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable however as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from these estimates in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit at the date when an acquisition is integrated into one of the established reporting units and is based on which reporting unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 

based on the result of the above test the company does not believe any of its reporting units are at risk of failing step 1 of the impairment test as the fair value for all reporting units is well in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value except for csi as the purchase price represents the fair value of the net assets acquired 

the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december 31 2010 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of november 30 2010 

 

  

   

 the following discussion regarding the company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units excludes the csi which was acquired in november 2010 

the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology the results of the dcf are evaluated against comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples in order to assess the reasonableness of the dcf fair values the dcf analysis requires significant judgments regarding the derivation of fair value including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments 

the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology which requires significant management judgment 

 

  

 amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no such events or changes during 2010 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the company’s reporting units may not be recoverable this determination was made based on improving market conditions which has resulted in higher projected cash flows for all reporting units than was projected in 2009 additionally there were no events or circumstances during 2010 that would indicate the need for an adjustment of the remaining useful lives of the company’s amortizable intangible assets 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its postretirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

   

 the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligation for its postretirement plans as of december 31 2010 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s postretirement plans 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise excluding differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets the company amortizes as a component of annual pension expense total outstanding gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets for moody’s postretirement plans the total losses as of december 31 2010 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 721 million and moody’s expects to recognize net periodic pension expense of 48 million in 2011 related to the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded us pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under asc topic 715 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2010 the company has an unrecognized asset loss of 118 million of which 71 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2012 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2011 operating income these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2011 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s postretirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  

 a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2011 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to postretirement plans will be 230 million in 2011 compared with 202 million in 2010 excluding the effect of pension settlement charges the expected expense increase in 2011 reflects the effects of higher benefit obligations primarily due to lower discount rate assumptions and higher amortization of actuarial losses 

stockbased compensation 

the company records compensation expense for all sharebased payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans stock options restricted stock and stock appreciation rights the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 

an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2010 dollars in millions 

 

   

 income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

moody’s is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

for utps asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

for certain of its foreign subsidiaries the company has deemed a portion of the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations accordingly the company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings a future distribution or change in assertion regarding reinvestment by the foreign subsidiaries relating to these earnings could result in additional tax liability for the company it is not practicable to determine the amount of the potential additional tax liability due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated dividend distributions from nonus subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s 

operating segments 

beginning in january 2008 moody’s segments were changed to reflect the reorganization announced in august 2007 as a result of the reorganization the rating agency is reported in the mis segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned all of moody’s other nonrating commercial activities are represented in the ma segment 

as part of the reorganization there were several realignments within the mis lobs sovereign and subsovereign ratings which were previously part of financial institutions infrastructureutilities ratings which were previously part of corporate finance and project finance which was previously part of structured finance were combined with the public finance business to form a new lob called public project and infrastructure finance in addition real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business furthermore in august 2008 the global managed investments ratings group previously part of the structured finance business was combined with the financial institutions business 

the mis segment now consists of four lines of business—corporate finance structured finance financial institutions and public project and infrastructure finance—that generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide 

as part of the reorganization various aspects of the legacy mis research business and mkmv business were combined to form the subscriptions software and professional services businesses within ma the subscriptions business included credit and economic research data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis for an initial 12month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk securities pricing and valuation 

  

 software products and the professional services business included credit training associated with risk modeling credit scorecard development and other specialized analytical projects as well as credit and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a perengagement basis 

in 2009 the aforementioned ma businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit structure for the ma segment at december 31 2009 pursuant to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed research data and analytics and the software business was renamed risk management software the revised groupings classify license software sales certain subscriptionbased risk management software revenue maintenance and advisory services relating to software sales to the redefined rms business the following tables are reconciliations of the revenue groupings previously disclosed to the new groupings for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

 additionally in november 2010 a subsidiary of the company acquired csi which is canada’s leading provider of financial learning credentials and certification csi is part of the ma segment and its revenue is included in the professional services lob within ma 

the following is a discussion of the results of operations of these segments including the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content data and products developed by mis additionally overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company are allocated to each segment based on a revenuesplit methodology overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy information technology and support staff such as finance human resource information technology and legal 

certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation

moody’s corporation 

the table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results followed by further insight and commentary 

 

 the table below shows moody’s global staffing by geographic area 

 

 global revenue of 20320 million in 2010 increased 2348 million compared to the same period in 2009 reflecting good growth in both ratings and ma revenue the growth in ratings revenue is primarily due to strong issuance activity in 2010 within the corporate finance financial institution and public finance debt markets the growth in ma is due to higher revenue across all lobs transaction revenue accounted for 44 of global mco revenue in 2010 compared to 37 in the same period of the prior year transaction revenue in the mis segment represents the initial rating of a new debt issuance as well as other onetime fees while relationship revenue represents the recurring monitoring of a rated debt obligation andor entities that issue such obligations as well as revenue from programs such as commercial paper mediumterm notes and shelf registrations in the ma segment relationship revenue represents subscriptionbased revenues and software maintenance revenue transaction revenue in ma represents software license fees and revenue from the professional services line of business which offers credit risk management advisory and training services which are typically sold on a perengagement basis 

us revenue increased 1687 million over 2009 reflecting growth in all ratings lobs most notably in rated issuance volumes for bank loans and speculativegrade corporate bonds there was also good growth over the prior year in us public finance and cref rated issuance additionally there was growth in all lobs within the ma segment most notably in rms 

international revenue increased 661 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily reflecting growth in cfg revenue particularly in speculativegrade ratings in emea coupled with higher banking related revenue across all regions additionally the growth 

  

 reflects higher revenue across all ma lobs primarily from within the asia and the americas regions these increases were partially offset by declines in most asset classes within sfg as well as declines in investmentgrade rated issuance within the emea region 

operating expenses were 6048 million in 2010 an increase of 724 million from the same period in 2009 and were primarily due to both higher compensation and noncompensation costs compensation costs increased approximately 63 million reflecting approximately 30 million higher incentive compensation primarily resulting from greater achievement against targeted results compared to achievement against targeted results in the prior year period a 7 million global profit sharing contribution due to the company’s growth in diluted eps over 2009 and approximately 29 million higher salaries and related employee benefits primarily due to annual merit increases coupled with higher headcount in both operating segments to support business growth noncompensation costs increased approximately 9 million reflecting higher professional service costs for ongoing investments in technology infrastructure as well as higher travelrelated costs which reflects improving business conditions compared to 2009 

sga expenses of 5880 million in 2010 increased 923 million from the same period in 2009 noncompensation expenses increased approximately 47 million over the prior year primarily reflecting higher professional service costs relating to ongoing investments in technology infrastructure as well as higher legal and litigationrelated costs related to ongoing matters compensation costs increased approximately 45 million primarily due to higher salaries and related employee benefits which reflects annual merit increases and headcount growth in sales personnel within ma as well as in support areas such as compliance and it additionally there was approximately 10 million higher incentive compensation costs compared to 2009 which primarily reflects greater achievement against targeted results compared to the achievement of targeted results in the prior year period furthermore there was an approximate 6 million profit sharing contribution in 2010 due to the company’s yearoveryear growth in diluted eps 

restructuring expense in 2009 reflects severance costs associated with the 2009 restructuring plan approved on march 27 2009 and adjustments to the previous estimates for both the 2007 and 2009 restructuring plans 

operating income of 7728 million was up 853 million from the same period in 2009 reflecting the 13 increase in revenue being partially offset by the 1495 million increase in expenses excluding the restructuring charge in 2009 and minor restructuringrelated adjustments in both periods operating income increased 679 million over 2009 

interest expense income net for the year ended december 31 2010 was 525 million a 191 million increase in expense compared to the same period in 2009 the increase relates primarily to an interest expense reduction of approximately 12 million in the first quarter of 2009 for utbs and other taxrelated liabilities that did not recur in 2010 also there was an approximate 7 million increase in interest expense on borrowings which primarily reflects interest on the 2010 senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2010 additionally there was interest income related to the favorable settlement of legacy tax matters of 25 million and 65 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

other nonoperating expense income net of 59 million in 2010 decreased 20 million compared to the prior year this decrease primarily reflects fx losses of approximately 5 million in 2010 compared to losses of approximately 10 million in 2009 the fx losses in both periods primarily reflect the weakening of the euro to the british pound over both of the twelve month periods ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

moody’s etr was 281 for the year ended december 31 2010 down from 370 in 2009 and was primarily due to increased taxable income internationally indefinite reinvestment of certain foreign earnings utilization of foreign tax credits lower state taxes and a resolution of a nonus tax audit resulting in a reduction of utbs additionally the 2009 etr reflects a nontaxable 12 million interest expense reduction related to utbs and other taxrelated liabilities the 2010 and 2009 tax expense included benefits of 21 million and 17 million respectively relating to the favorable resolution of legacy tax matters see “contingencies – legacy tax matters” below for further information excluding the legacy tax matters in both years the etr in 2010 of 285 decreased 910 bps from 2009 

net income for the year ended december 31 2010 was 5078 million or 215 per diluted share and increased 1058 million or 046 per diluted share compared to the prior year included in the 2010 net income were tax benefits of approximately 36 million or 015 per diluted share relating to the indefinite reinvestment of certain foreign earnings utilization of foreign tax credits and lower state taxes excluding benefits for favorable resolutions of legacy tax matters in both 2010 and 2009 as well as the restructuring charge in 2009 and related adjustments in both years net income increased 986 million or 24 to 5033 million resulting in a 043 or 25 increase in diluted eps compared to the prior year 

  

 segment results 

moody’s investors service 

the table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results followed by further insight and commentary 

 

 the following is a discussion of external mis revenue as well as operating expenses 

global mis revenue of 14050 million for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 1873 million compared to the same period in 2009 the increase reflects strong growth in rated issuance volumes for highyield corporate debt and bank loans within cfg as well as good growth from public finance and banking related issuance within ppif and fig respectively these increases were partially offset by declines in derivatives and investmentgrade corporate debt rated issuance volumes within sfg and cfg respectively transaction revenue for mis in 2010 was 57 of total revenue compared to 50 in 2009 with the increase primarily reflecting the aforementioned strong rated issuance in the highyield corporate debt and bank loan sectors within cfg 

in the us revenue was 8154 million in 2010 an increase of 1523 million or 23 compared to the same period in 2009 the increase relates primarily to strong rated issuance volumes in bank loans and highyield corporate debt within cfg higher rated issuance in the cref sector within sfg and good growth in ppif these increases were partially offset by declines in derivatives and consumer assetbacked securities rated issuance within sfg 

nonus revenue was 5896 million in 2010 an increase of 350 million or 6 over the prior year the increase reflects growth in banking related revenue across all nonus regions as well as higher speculativegrade corporate debt issuance in the emea region additionally there was higher revenue in 2010 for indicative ratings and corporate family ratings in the emea region these increases were partially offset by declines within the emea region in most asset classes within sfg coupled with lower rated issuance volumes for investmentgrade corporate debt 

global cfg revenue of 5639 million in 2010 increased 1557 million from the prior year primarily due to higher rated issuance volumes in the highyield corporate debt and bank loan sectors coupled with an increase in indicative ratings and corporate family ratings the aforementioned growth was partially offset by declines in rated issuance for investmentgrade corporate debt which reflects a strong prior year comparative period where many companies were refinancing their debt ahead of expected maturities transaction revenue represented 73 of total cfg revenue in 2010 compared to 64 in the prior year in the us revenue in 2010 was 3695 million or 47 higher than the same period in 2009 this increase is primarily due to higher bank loan issuance reflecting the narrowing of credit spreads and the low interest rate environment in 2010 which has resulted in a high volume of refinancing activity coupled with increased issuance related to leveraged buyout activity additionally there was higher speculativegrade corporate debt issuance reflecting increased investor appetite for highyield instruments as stability has gradually returned to the corporate credit markets internationally revenue of 1944 million in 2010 increased 24 compared to the same period in 2009 driven primarily by growth in rated issuance volumes for speculativegrade corporate debt across all regions which reflects the aforementioned increased

depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 90 million from prior year primarily due to adjustments recorded in 2008 relating to an approximate 11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets and a 45 million writeoff of acquired inprocess technology related to the acquisition of fermat the absence of these items in 2009 was partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets during 2009 associated with business acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008

for claims litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability is expected to be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate in other instances because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation regulatory enforcement and similar matters and contingencies particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also cannot predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve the pending matters referred to above progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition however in light of the inherent 

  

 uncertainties involved in these matters the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them and the novel theories of law asserted an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic 740 of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

legacy tax matters 

moody’s continues to have exposure to potential liabilities arising from legacy tax matters as of december 31 2010 moody’s has recorded liabilities for legacy tax matters totaling 593 million this includes liabilities and accrued interest due to new db arising from the 2000 distribution agreement it is possible that the ultimate liability for legacy tax matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the company which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody’s future reported results financial position and cash flows 

the following summary of the relationships among moody’s new db and their predecessor entities is important in understanding the company’s exposure to the legacy tax matters 

in november 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation separated into three separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation acnielsen corporation and cognizant corporation in june 1998 the dun  bradstreet corporation separated into two separate public companies old db and rh donnelley corporation during 1998 cognizant separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated and nielsen media research inc in september 2000 old db separated into two separate public companies new db and moody’s 

old db and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities old db and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable irs determinations on certain tax matters and certain other potential tax liabilities all as described in such agreements further in connection with the 2000 distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement new db and moody’s have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to these legacy tax matters 

at the time of the 2000 distribution new db paid moody’s 550 million for 50 of certain anticipated future tax benefits through 2012 in the event that these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by new db or there is an irs audit of new db impacting these tax benefits moody’s would be required to repay to new db an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits as well as its share of any tax liability incurred by new db as of december 31 2010 moody’s liability with respect to this matter totaled 573 million in 2008 as part of this matter and due to a statue of limitations expiration moody’s recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of 23 million 14 million net of tax and an increase in other nonoperating income of 64 million relating to amounts due to new db 

in 2005 settlement agreements were executed with the irs with respect to certain legacy tax matters related to the years 19891990 and 19931996 with respect to these settlements moody’s and new db believed that ims health and nmr did not pay their full share of the liability to the irs under the terms of the applicable separation agreements between the parties moody’s and new db subsequently paid these amounts to the irs and commenced arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr to resolve this dispute this resulted in settlement payments to moody’s of 67 million in 2008 61 million as a reduction of interest expense and 06 million as a reduction of selling general and administrative expense and 108 million 65 million as a reduction of interest expense and 43 million as a reduction of tax expense in 2009 the aforementioned settlement payments resulted in net income benefits of 4 million and 82 million in 2008 and 2009 respectively the company continues to carry a 2 million liability for this matter 

in 2006 new db and moody’s each deposited 398 million with the irs in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years in 2007 new db and moody’s requested a return of that deposit the irs applied a portion of our deposit in satisfaction of an assessed deficiency and returned the balance to the company moody’s subsequently pursued a refund for a portion of the outstanding amount in may 2010 the irs refunded 52 million to us for the 1997 tax year which included interest of approximately 25 million resulting in an aftertax benefit of 46 million

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly in terms of outstanding principal amount and types of securities or other obligations beginning in mid2007 there was a severe market disruption and decline in issuance activity for some significant asset classes of securities in the us and internationally despite the recent market disruption moody’s believes that the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued secular growth of fixedincome markets worldwide moody’s business prospects correspond closely to the health of the world’s major economies and capital markets throughout 2009 there has been gradual improvement in global capital market and economic conditions the sustainability of these improvements will influence the company’s growth over the near term moody’s is well positioned to benefit from a longterm recovery in global credit market activity and a more informed use of credit ratings research and related analytical products in an environment of renewed attention to risk analysis and risk management restoring investor confidence in structured products may require further enhancements to mis’s rating processes and may be facilitated by greater transparency from issuers of structured or securitized debt moody’s expects that these initiatives will support continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions an expectation of recoverydriven growth in capital market activity supported by initiatives to increase market share leverage pricing opportunities and develop additional data research and rating products represent key growth drivers for moody’s 

growth in global fixedincome markets is attributable to a number of forces and trends advances in information technology make information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world technology facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets technology allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell which in the absence of the appropriate technology may not be easily obtainable this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and development of worldwide financial markets and a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk as a result existing capital markets have expanded and a number of new capital markets have emerged in addition more issuers and investors are accessing developed capital markets information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support moody’s continued expansion in developing markets 

another trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets recent credit market disruptions have slowed the trend of disintermediation globally but moody’s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems thus disintermediation is expected to accelerate in the longerterm with moody’s continuing to target investment and resources to growing international markets where disintermediation and bond issuance should remain more robust 

the strong growth trend seen in the issuance of structured finance securities reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil with continued declines seen in 2009 the market disruptions that escalated in 2008 are expected to continue in the immediate term however moody’s expects to see some revenue stabilization from this market in 2010 despite significant declines from peak market levels moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global credit markets and provide opportunities for longer term growth moody’s will continue to monitor and support the progress of this market and adapt to meet the changing needs of its participants 

rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets moody’s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and the prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decision process however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings subscriptionbased research and other areas partially mitigate moody’s dependence on the volume or number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets 

moody’s operations are also subject to various risks inherent in conducting business internationally such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources however the formation of for example a new governmentsponsored regional or global rating agency would pose a risk to moody’s growth prospects management believes that this risk compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry is relatively low because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required with uncertainty about the likelihood of financial success for the entity 

  

   

legislative bodies and regulators in the us europe and selective other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of cras which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of mis or increased costs of doing business for moody’s therefore in order to broaden the potential for expansion of nonratings services moody’s reorganized in january 2008 into two distinct businesses mis consisting solely of the ratings business and ma ma conducts all nonratings activities including the sale of credit research produced by mis and the production and sale of other economic and creditrelated products and services the reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by ma into activities which may have otherwise been restricted for mis due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities 

ma expects to benefit from the growing demand among credit market participants for information that enables them to make sound investment and risk management decisions these customers require advanced qualitative and quantitative tools to support their management of increasingly complex capital market instruments such complexity creates analytical challenges for market participants including financial intermediaries asset managers and other investors in recent years reliable thirdparty ratings and research served to supplement or substitute for traditional inhouse research as the scale geographic scope and complexity of financial markets grew moody’s remains focused on driving improvements in customer retention product placements and new customer acquisition in this area 

recent disruptions in credit markets have resulted in higher than normal customer attrition in ma moody’s remains focused on driving improvements in customer retention product placements and new customer acquisition and expects to sustain reliance on its offerings as enhancements to credit rating methodologies and other changes in securities origination processes restore investor confidence and more orderly market operations 

growth in ma is also expected as financial institutions adopt active credit portfolio management practices and implement internal credit assessment tools for compliance with basel ii regulations ma offers products that respond to these needs this growth will be realized by for example the development of new private firm default probability models for specific countries and by expanding analysis capabilities of new asset classes 

competition 

the mis business competes with other cras and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research many of moody’s customers also have inhouse credit research capabilities moody’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp’s while in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp moody’s competitors include fitch dominion bond rating service ltd of canada am best company inc japan credit rating agency ltd rating and investment information inc of japan and eganjones ratings company in 2008 two more firms were granted the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations status in the us lace financial corp and realpoint llc additional rating agencies may emerge in the us as the sec continues to expand the number of nrsros other competition may arise in the us from credit opinion providers who do not operate as nrsro’s such as morningstar or coface competition may also increase in developed or developing markets outside the us over the next few years as the number of rating agencies increases although a more regulated credit ratings industry both domestic and internationally may provide for a less appealing expansion territory 

the increased regulatory focus on credit risk presents both opportunities and challenges for moody’s global demand for credit ratings and risk management services may rise but regulatory actions may result in a greater number of rating agencies andor additional regulation of moody’s and its competitors alternatively banking or securities market regulators could seek to reduce the use of ratings in regulations thereby reducing certain elements of demand for ratings or otherwise seek to control the analysis or business of rating agencies 

credit rating agencies such as mis also compete with other means of managing credit risk such as credit insurance competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk also may pose a competitive threat to moody’s 

ma competes broadly in the financial information space against diversified competitors such as thomsonreuters bloomberg riskmetrics sp fitch dun  bradstreet and markit group among others ma’s main competitors within rda include sp fitch algorithmics creditsights thomsonreuters intex ihs global insight blackrock solutions and other smaller boutique providers of fixed income analytics valuations economic data and research in rms ma faces competition from fitch algorithmics sungard sas oracle and other various smaller vendors and inhouse solutions within professional services ma competes with oliver wyman for certain credit risk advisory services with omega performance dc gardner and a host of boutique providers for financial training 

  

   

moody’s strategy 

moody’s continues to follow growth strategies that adapt to market conditions and capitalize on emerging opportunities 

given recent market turmoil moody’s immediate focus is on making effective business decisions to adapt to challenging economic and market conditions while positioning the company to benefit from an eventual recovery in global credit market activity 

given the renewed attention to risk analysis and risk management moody’s is committed to further encouraging the informed use of credit ratings research and related analytics products 

moody’s seeks to differentiate itself from incumbent and potential competitors with predictive uniquely thoughtful and forwardlooking opinions about credit and the credit industry 

adapting to market change is a key factor in maintaining market relevance moody’s continuously monitors opportunities to selectively diversify its revenue base through organic growth and acquisitions in order to replace areas of lost revenue and position the company for new sources of business 

in support of those goals moody’s intends to continue its focus in the following areas 

expansion in financial centers 

moody’s serves its customers through its global network of offices and business affiliations moody’s currently maintains comprehensive rating and commercial operations in financial centers including buenos aires dubai frankfurt hong kong london madrid milan mexico city moscow new york paris sao paolo seoul singapore sydney tokyo and toronto moody’s expects that its global network will position it to benefit from the expansion of worldwide capital markets and thereby increase revenue moody’s also expects that the growth of its mis business as a consequence of financial market integration in europe will return additionally moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures this will allow moody’s to extend its credit opinion franchise to local and regional obligors through domestic currency ratings and national scale ratings 

new rating products 

moody’s continues to respond to investor demand for new products and enhancements in the recent market turmoil attention to core strengths has been crucial and enhancements have and continue to be focused on quality and transparency given the particular disruption in the structured finance markets mis has been developing enhanced structured finance offerings to meet investor demands for more information content leveraging the diversity of its research data and analytics moody’s has introduced crosssector analysis to better illustrate the broader impacts of recent market events this is further enhanced by the incorporation of macroeconomics to frame conditions and assumptions mis continues to capitalize on market developments and enhance ratings surveillance efficiency focusing on new ratings products such as hedge fund operations quality ratings and to identify design develop and maintain valueadded research analytics and data products serving the capital markets 

internetenhanced products and services 

moody’s is expanding its use of the internet and other electronic media to enhance customer service moody’s website provides the public with instant access to ratings and provides the public and subscribers with credit research and risk assessment tools internet delivery also enables moody’s to provide services to more individuals within a customer organization than were available with paperbased products and to offer highervalue services because of more timely delivery moody’s expects that access to these applications will increase customer use of moody’s services moody’s expects to continue to invest in electronic media to capitalize on these and other opportunities 

expansion of credit research products and investment analytic tools 

moody’s plans to expand its research and analytic services through internal development and potentially through acquisitions most new product initiatives are more analytical and dataintensive than traditional narrative research offerings such services address investor interest in replicating the types of monitoring activities conducted by moody’s analysts and provide the means for customers to gain access to raw data and financial statistics and ratios used by mis in the rating process for municipalities companies and financial institutions these products represent important sources of growth for the research business ma is developing products in the fixedincome valuations and pricing arena that facilitate price transparency in global fixed income markets especially for complex structured securities and derivative instruments moreover moody’s continues to explore opportunities to extend its research relevance in new domestic or regional markets eg china as well as new functional markets eg hedge funds 

new quantitative credit risk assessment services 

moody’s will continue to provide banks and other institutions with quantitative credit risk assessment solutions moody’s believes that there will be increased demand for such services because they assist customers trading or holding creditsensitive assets to better manage risk and deliver better performance also international bank regulatory authorities are assessing the adequacy of banks’ internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining regulatory capital the acquisition of fermat accelerates moody’s capabilities in this area such regulatory initiatives create demand for and encourage adoption of related services by banks from thirdparty providers 

  

   

regulation 

in the us since 1975 mis has been designated as an nrsro by the sec the sec first applied the nrsro designation in that year to companies whose credit ratings could be used by brokerdealers for purposes of determining their net capital requirements since that time congress the sec and other governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of nrsros to distinguish between “investmentgrade” and “noninvestmentgrade” securities among other purposes 

in september 2006 the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 was passed which created a voluntary registration process for rating agencies wishing to be designated as nrsros the reform act provides the sec with authority to oversee nrsros while prohibiting the sec from regulating the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any nrsro determines credit ratings in june 2007 the sec published its first set of rules under the reform act these rules address the nrsro application and registration process as well as oversight rules related to recordkeeping financial reporting prevention of misuse of material nonpublic information conflicts of interest and prohibited acts and practices in june 2007 mis filed its application for registration as an nrsro with the sec in september 2007 the sec registered mis as an nrsro under the securities exchange act of 1934 and as of that time mis has been subject to the sec’s oversight rules described above as required by the rules mis has made its form nrsro initial application its annual certification of form nrsro and any associated updates publicly available by posting it on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

in july 2008 the sec released a report on its examination of cras the sec began its review of the ratings processes and procedures of the three leading rating agencies – mis sp and fitch – in august 2007 focusing on subprime rmbs and cdos while the commission’s staff noted that most of the period under review predated the implementation of sec rules for the industry the report identified areas that were either of concern to the sec or that the sec believed could be enhanced goingforward the concerns identified by the commission’s staff generally fall into three categories policies addressing potential conflicts of interest resources and resource allocation documentation around policies and procedures and enhancing transparency the sec also summarized the various steps that are already being put in place by the rating agencies as well as those that are under consideration in the sec’s current rulemaking process 

in february 2009 the sec published a second set of rules applicable to nrsros the majority of which provide requirements for managing conflicts of interest enhancing record keeping requirements and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies several of these rules became operative in april 2009 

in april 2009 mis participated in a roundtable held by the sec on the oversight of credit rating agencies the sec’s stated objective was to elicit the views of a broad crosssection of market participants the roundtable was a fullday event and consisted of four panels current nrsro perspectives competition issues users’ perspectives and approaches to improve credit rating agency oversight in preparation for the roundtable participants were asked to submit statements and mis’s statement is available on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

in november 2009 the sec published a third set of final rules for nrsros these rules which will come into force in june 2010 require additional disclosure of rating histories and prohibit nrsros from rating structured finance products unless the issuer makes the same information accessible to all nrsros that it provides to an nrsro hired to determine the rating in 2009 the sec also determined to eliminate references to nrsro ratings in certain regulations retain some references and seek additional comments on other references in december 2009 the comment period closed on an sec proposal to require disclosure about credit ratings when ratings are used in connection with the sale of registered securities and a concept release on the treatment of nrsros as experts under the securities act of 1933 in february 2010 the comment period closed on proposed sec rules for nrsros regarding the compliance function and disclosure about revenues received for credit rating services mis’s comments to the sec can be found on the regulatory affairs webpage of the company’s website 

both chambers of congress as well as the administration are reviewing the broader us regulatory infrastructure and as part of this review the role and function of cras will continue to be studied for example as part of a series of hearings focusing on the existing market turmoil on october 22 2008 the house committee on oversight and government reform “house oversight committee” held a hearing on the role of credit rating agencies in which mis participated 

on june 17 2009 the us department of the treasury “treasury” published its proposal on “financial regulatory reform a new foundation” “administration’s proposal” as it pertains to cras the administration’s proposal asked the sec to continue its efforts to strengthen the regulation of cras including measures to require that firms have robust policies and procedures that manage and disclose conflicts of interest differentiate between structured and other products and otherwise promote the integrity of the rating process the administration’s proposal also recommended that regulators should reduce their use of credit ratings in regulations and supervisory practices wherever possible 

subsequently the treasury produced and sent to congress a series of proposed bills that seek to implement the various aspects of the administration’s proposal with respect to the cra industry the treasury’s proposed bill was sent to the congress on july 21st it is 

  

   

entitled “improvements to the regulation of credit rating agencies” and is organized in order to address the following areas mandatory registration of credit rating agencies enhanced regulation of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations strengthening credit rating agency independence and issuer disclosure of preliminary ratings 

as part of the ongoing debate in congress mis participated in two hearings on september 30 2009 one hearing was held by the house oversight committee and the other by the house financial services subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises following these hearings the house financial services committee approved a bill entitled “accountability and transparency in rating agencies act” the rating agency bill was later incorporated into the larger financial reform draft legislation which was approved by the full house in december 2009 presently the senate is considering its version of a bill that would enhance oversight of cras both the house and senate bills currently contain provisions that could potentially increase the costs associated with the operation of a cra and increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings as the legislative process is still ongoing it is as yet too early to assess the potential impact of additional legislation 

internationally several regulatory developments have occurred 

the group of 8 and the group of 20—in november 2008 the heads of state of the g20 reached agreement on a wideranging set of proposals to better regulate financial systems among other things the g20 committed to implement oversight of the cras consistent with the strengthened international organization of securities commissions’ code of conduct see below and agreed that in the medium term the countries should implement a registration system for cras the g20 also committed to formulate their regulations and other measures in a consistent manner and recommended that iosco review cras’ adoption of the standards and mechanisms for monitoring compliance 

on april 2 2009 the g20 heads of state meeting was held in london where the g20 provided a sixpart action plan to address the financial crisis 1 to restore confidence growth and jobs 2 to repair the financial system to restore lending 3 to strengthen financial regulation and rebuild trust 4 to fund and reform international financial institutions to overcome the current crisis and prevent future ones 5 to promote global trade and investment and reject protectionism and 6 to build an inclusive green and sustainable recovery the g20’s plan also contains a number of provisions that are specific to cras in particular the g20 member states agreed to extend regulatory oversight to and require registration of cras in order to ensure that they adhere to the international code of good practice on july 10 2009 the g8 restated its commitment to implement the g20’s statement 

in september 2009 the g20 met in pittsburgh and developed a progress report on actions to promote global financial regulatory reform with respect to cras the g20 acknowledged that stronger oversight regimes for cras have been developed in the eu the us and japan and recognized that the development of good practices for due diligence by asset managers investing in structured finance products will result in reduced reliance on credit ratings the g20 also expressed concern about the creation of globally inconsistent regulations 

iosco—in december 2004 the technical committee of iosco published its code of conduct fundamentals for credit rating agencies in may 2008 iosco published the revised iosco code the changes made to the iosco code broadly address greater transparency of methodologies and processes by cras in july 2008 iosco also announced that it will monitor the cras implementation of the iosco code changes and it will explore the means by which iosco members might work together to verify the proper and complete disclosure by cras of information required by the iosco code 

on march 12 2009 iosco published its second review of the cras implementation of the iosco code the report noted that seven out of the 21 cras reviewed had implemented the iosco code in their own codes of conduct in particular mis was found to have substantially implemented the 2008 revisions to the iosco code iosco also published and sent a note to the g20 and financial stability forum regarding the use of the iosco code as the basis for international oversight of cras and mechanisms by which regulators can help assure adequate crossborder supervision of globally active cras in addition iosco announced the establishment of a new standing committee that will address global issues regarding the cra industry 

mis initially published its code of professional conduct pursuant to the iosco code in june 2005 and published an updated version in october 2007 in november 2008 mis revised its code to reflect the changes made to the iosco code beginning in 2006 mis has annually published a report that describes its implementation of the code the mis code and the three annual reports that have been published thus far can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

finally iosco is exploring the possibility of supervisory colleges andor bilateral cooperation arrangements for the oversight of cras to address concerns relating to globally fragmented regulations and in order to promote greater interaction between cras and regulators as well as greater coordination among regulators overseeing international cras 

eu—in late april 2009 the european parliament voted and passed on a new regulation “eu regulation” that establishes an oversight regime for the cra industry in the european union the company expects that cras will need to be in compliance with the eu regulation of cras in the second half of 2010 the framework for the eu regulation requires the registration formal regulation and 

  

   

periodic inspection of cras operating in the eu the eu regulation also sets out specific requirements for the use of ratings that are produced outside of the eu and used for regulatory purposes in the eu among these is a requirement for the relevant competent authority in the eu and the competent authority of the noneu jurisdiction where that rating has been produced to enter into a cooperation agreement containing provisions related to the exchange of information and the coordination of supervisory activities the details of how these and other requirements will be implemented have yet to be decided and it is therefore too early to assess the impact of the eu regulation on mis’s operations or financial results 

the basel committee—in june 2004 the basel committee on banking supervision published a new bank capital adequacy framework called basel ii to replace its initial 1988 framework under basel ii ratings assigned by recognized cras or ecais can be used by banks in determining credit risk weights for many of their institutional credit exposures recognized ecais could be subject to a broader range of oversight national authorities have begun the ecai recognition process mis has been recognized as an ecai in several jurisdictions and the recognition process is ongoing in many others mis does not currently believe that basel ii will materially affect its financial position or results of operations as a result of the recent regulatory activity the banking authorities of the basel committee are reconsidering the overall basel ii framework it is as yet too early to assess the form and content of this reevaluation 

other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future in addition in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which mis operates the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of mis cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s 

finally the g20 has announced that by the end of 2009 the basel committee will review the role of external ratings in regulation and determine whether any adverse incentives need to be addressed it is our understanding that this work has begun

 item 1a   risk factors tableend the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occur moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets 

approximately 50 of mis’ revenue for 2009 was transactionbased compared to 49 of mis’ revenue in 2008 and 68 of mis revenue in 2007 revenue from rating transactions in turn is dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets accordingly any conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings 

a significant disruption in world financial markets particularly in the credit markets began in mid2007 when many credit markets experienced a severe lack of liquidity this disruption continues to be felt these credit market disruptions together with the current economic slowdown have negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings notwithstanding a recent increase in investmentgrade and speculativegrade debt issuances in 2009 future issuance could be negatively affected by a sharp increase in longterm interest rates or factors which cause instability or volatility in the global capital markets new debt issuances in the structured finance market are likely to continue to be significantly below peak levels reached in the middle of the past decade consequently the company has experienced a substantial reduction in the overall demand for rating newly issued debt securities changes in the markets and the role regulation and structure of rating agencies may have material adverse effects on the company even if the markets recover 

the timing and nature of any recovery in the credit and other financial markets remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the future or that financial results will not continue to be adversely affected a sustained period of market decline or weakness especially if it relates to credit sensitive securities for which there was historically a high level of demand for ratings could continue to have a material adverse effect on moody’s business and financial results initiatives that the company has undertaken to reduce costs may not be sufficient to offset the results of a continued or more severe downturn and further cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the near term due in part to rent technology and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further the costreduction initiatives undertaken to date could result in strains in the company’s operations if the credit markets and demand for ratings return to levels that prevailed prior to mid2007 or otherwise unexpectedly surge 

other factors that could further reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities include increases in interest rates or credit spreads continued volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment significant regulatory political or economic events the use of alternative sources of credit including financial institutions and government sources defaults of significant issuers and other unfavorable market and economic conditions 

furthermore issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or which are rated or evaluated by nontraditional parties such as financial advisors rather than traditional credit rating agencies such as moodys the sec and other regulatory and governmental authorities globally have also been proposing and implementing changes in existing rules to decrease the reliance on ratings for regulatory purposes decreases in the use of ratings in debt issuances or reliance upon noncra risk evaluations could result in reduced revenues and adversely impact moodys results 

finally given the changing regulatory and market environment even if credit markets revive there is no assurance that the demand for credit ratings would follow prior patterns as such no assurance can be given as to the amount of revenues that would be derived there from 

regulation as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization and potential for new domestic and overseas legislation and regulations 

credit rating agencies are regulated in both the us and in other countries including by state and local authorities currently moody’s is designated as an nrsro pursuant to sec regulations enacted in response to the adoption of the reform act one of the central promises of the reform act was to encourage competition among rating agencies given its comparatively recent adoption and the number of additional reforms being proposed and considered moody’s is unable accurately to assess the future impact of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec’s regulations or the impact on moody’s competitive position or its current practices possible consequences of these new regulations include issues that may affect all entities engaged in the rating agency business such as expected increased costs or issues that may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner any of these changes could negatively 

  

   

impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or the markets for its products and services in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict 

further over the past year both the g8 and the g20 finance ministers and central bank governors have sought to analyze and arrive at a consistent approach for addressing the various areas of the financial market and have made a variety of recommendations as to regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings finance ministers have also agreed to register rating agencies in their home jurisdiction as a result of the internationally coordinated activity individual countries have begun implementing registration regimes for the oversight of cras in the coming years in particular the european union adopted a new regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the eu the regulation seeks to introduce a common eu regulatory approach to the oversight of cras its primary objective is to enhance the integrity transparency responsibility governance and reliability of credit rating activities by laying down conditions for the issuance of credit ratings and rules on the organization and conduct of credit rating agencies the regulation will likely become fully implemented by the second quarter of 2010 as with the recent regulatory initiatives in the us these initiatives may affect all entities engaged in the rating agency business or may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner and could negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or the markets for its products and services in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict 

in addition to the foregoing in the wake of the credit crisis many legislative and regulatory agencies both in the us and in other countries have been studying or pursuing new laws and regulations addressing cras and the use of credit ratings particularly in the area of structured finance securities and the role of cras in leading up to such disruptions given the g20 statement it is likely that such initiatives will lead to additional laws or regulations affecting moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or the markets for its products and services this could include adopting regulations that affect the need for debt securities to be rated establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings which could negatively affect competition among rating agencies the level of demand for ratings or the company’s ability to provide objective assessments of creditworthiness additional regulations are likely to increase the costs associated with the operation of a cra alter the rating agencies’ communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings change the regulatory framework to which cras are subject and affect the competitive environment in which cras operate 

as existing laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and new laws or regulations are adopted the costs of compliance can be expected to increase and moody’s may not be able to pass these costs through the pricing of its products in addition increased regulatory uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of laws and regulations may increase costs decrease demand or affect the manner in which moody’s or its customers or users of credit ratings operate or alter the economics of the credit ratings business by restricting or mandating the business models under which a cra is permitted to operate 

moodys stock price may also be affected by speculation regarding legislative and regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on moodys business 

a description of several of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the us and other countries is described above under the section entitled “regulation” in item 1 “business” of this form 10k 

legal economic and regulatory risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions 

moody’s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the us in addition to the regulatory risks discussed above operations in different countries expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into us dollars and currency fluctuations us laws affecting overseas operations including regulations applicable under the office of foreign asset control and the foreign corrupt practices act domestic and foreign export and import restrictions tariffs and other trade barriers political and economic instability the possibility of nationalization expropriation price controls and other restrictive governmental actions longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables and potentially adverse tax consequences 

in addition to competition from other rating agencies that operate in a number of international jurisdictions and specialized companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company inc with respect to the insurance industry in many foreign countries moody’s will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence and greater familiarity or a longer operating history in those markets these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions that moody’s does not receive putting moody’s at a competitive disadvantage 

uncertain impact of government actions to stabilize financial institutions and markets 

the us government announced several programs in 2008 including the emergency economic stabilization act the october 14 2008 joint statement by the us treasury federal reserve and fdic announcing the troubled asset relief program through which the government is authorized to purchase up to 700 billion in whole loans and mortgagerelated securities as well as to invest directly in financial institutions the treasury department’s money market mutual fund guaranty program the federal reserve’s commercial paper 

  

   

funding facility and payment of interest on reserve balances the fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program and the february 10 2009 statement by the us treasury additionally the governments of many nations and international organizations such as the international monetary fund have announced similar measures for institutions and countries around the world there is no assurance that these programs individually or collectively will have beneficial effects in the credit markets will address credit or liquidity issues of companies that participate in the programs will reduce volatility or uncertainty in the financial markets or will reverse or moderate the slowdown and downturn of world economies the failure of these programs to have their intended effects could have a material adverse effect on the financial markets which in turn could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations in addition these and similar initiatives could reduce the demand for ratings of credit securities or other financial products could result in increased government regulation of such markets and could have other unanticipated adverse effects on the markets for and demand for debt securities andor for ratings of such instruments 

increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service as well as increased competition from nonnrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors at the same time bankruptcies and consolidation of customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of customers while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and service if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors moody’s may lose market share 

introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies 

the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are highly competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and to utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by the company customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and the company’s growth prospects in addition moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by limitations of its information technologies that fail to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors 

significant amount of intangible assets 

moodys has a significant amount of intangible assets on its balance sheet consisting of 3492 million of goodwill and 1049 of amortizable intangible assets approximately 97 of these intangibles reside in the ma business and are allocated to the three reporting units within ma rda rms and training failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in one or all of these reporting units could result in an asset impairment charge which would reduce net income in the period the impairment is recorded impairment of goodwill or intangibles would result in a noncash charge to operating expenses an impairment would result if the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group which holds goodwill or any intangible assets is less than the carrying amount of its net assets a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group is its projected cash flows future cash flows of ma are dependent on a variety of factors such as but not limited to general economic growth capital market activity product innovation pricing market share and competition the breakdown in or the failure to achieve success in managing one or a combination of these factors could lead to reduced cash flows resulting in an asset impairment charge 

exposure to litigation related to moody’s rating opinions 

currently moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities as part of ongoing investigations and is responding to those inquiries in addition moody’s faces litigation from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions as well as other related business practices in these difficult economic times and turbulent markets when the value of creditdependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased the number of investigations and legal proceedings moody’s is facing has increased significantly these proceedings impose additional expenses on the company which may increase over time as these matters progress procedurally require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues and given the number of these proceedings and lawsuits present a greater risk that moodys may be subject to fines or damages which would be the case if we are deemed to have violated any laws or regulations as moody’s international business expands these types of claims may increase or become more costly because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that currently exist in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as provided by the first amendment and may pose criminal rather than civil penalties for noncompliance these risks often are and may continue to be difficult to assess or quantify and we may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover them and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time 

  

   

in addition to the extent that any of the recent legislative initiatives are successful in modifying in a manner adverse to cras the rules governing the potential liability of cras in connection with the issuance of ratings the number of legal proceedings especially as related to future ratings may increase materially and the potential exposure of cras thereunder may also increase 

exposure to reputational and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation is one of the key bases on which the company competes to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors has suffered a loss in credibility in the course of the credit crisis or in the future suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be adversely affected factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities by a particular rating agency the timing and nature of changes in ratings adverse publicity as to the ratings process a major compliance failure and increased criticism by users of ratings regulators and legislative bodies 

possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures 

moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by or providing more favorable working conditions or within the limits of todays market constraints offering higher compensation than moodys moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis moody’s may also lose key employees due to other factors such as catastrophes that could lead to disruption of business operations moody’s ability to compete effectively will continue to depend among other things on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees 

the trading price of our stock could be affected by third party actions 

ownership of our stock is highly concentrated with a majority of our shares held by a few institutional stockholders due to this concentrated stockholder base the trading price of our stock could be affected considerably by decisions of significant stockholders to increase or decrease their positions including any actions taken to implement such a decision 

moody’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located including having its headquarters in new york city and offices in major cities worldwide this may include a disruption involving electrical communications or other services used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business whether due to human error natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage computer viruses intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism or war or otherwise moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of major operating systems may not be successful the company does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations their ability to service and interact with moody’s clients and customers may suffer 

the company’s operations also rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks the business relies upon and processes a great deal of data through its systems the quality of which must be maintained in order for the business units to perform although moody’s takes protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant its computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses or other malicious events that could have a security impact if one or more of such events occur this could jeopardize moody’s or its clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through its computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s its clients’ its counterparties’ or third parties’ operations moody’s may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures and the company may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by moody’s

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend from time to time moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings governmental investigations claims and litigation that are incidental to the company’s business including claims based on ratings assigned by mis moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business management periodically assesses the company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to sec rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate 

following the events in the us subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly over the last two years mis and other credit rating agencies are the subject of intense scrutiny increased regulation ongoing investigation and civil litigation legislative regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are considering additional legislation regulation and enforcement actions including with respect to mis’s compliance with newly imposed regulatory standards moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other governmental authorities and is responding to such investigations and inquiries moody’s is cooperating with a review by the sec relating to errors in the model used by mis to rate certain constantproportion debt obligations in addition the company is facing market participant litigation relating to the performance of mis rated securities although moody’s in the normal course experiences such litigation the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased in the current economic environment 

on june 27 2008 the brockton contributory retirement system a purported shareholder of the company’s securities filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the company against its directors and certain senior officers and the company as nominal defendant in the supreme court of the state of new york county of new york the plaintiff asserts various causes of action relating to the named defendants’ oversight of mis’s ratings of rmbs and constantproportion debt obligations and their participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading information about mis’s ratings practices andor a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing the plaintiff seeks compensatory damages restitution disgorgement of profits and other equitable relief on july 2 2008 thomas r flynn a purported shareholder of the company’s securities filed a similar purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the company against its directors and certain senior officers and the company as nominal defendant in the supreme court of the state of new york county of new york asserting similar claims and seeking the same relief the cases have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in november 2008 the company removed the consolidated action to the united states district court for the southern district of new york in december 2008 in january 2009 the plaintiffs moved to remand the case to the supreme court of the state of new york which the company opposed on february 23 2010 the court issued an opinion remanding the case to the supreme court of new york on october 30 2008 the louisiana municipal police employees retirement system a purported shareholder of the company’s securities also filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the company against its directors and certain officers and the company as a nominal defendant in the us district court for the southern district of new york this complaint too asserts various causes of action relating to the company’s ratings of rmbs cdo and constantproportion debt obligations and named defendants’ participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading information about mis’s ratings practices andor a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing on december 9 2008 rena nadoff a purported shareholder of the company filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the company against its directors and its ceo and the company as a nominal defendant in the supreme court of the state of new york the complaint asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with alleged overrating of assetbacked securities and underrating of municipal securities on october 20 2009 the company moved to dismiss or stay the action in favor of related federal litigation on january 26 2010 the court entered a stipulation and order submitted jointly by the parties staying the nadoff litigation pending coordination and prosecution of similar claims in the above and below described federal derivative actions on july 6 2009 w a sokolowski a purported shareholder of the company filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the company against its directors and current and former officers and the company as a nominal defendant in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the complaint asserts claims relating to alleged mismanagement of the company’s processes for rating structured finance transactions alleged insider trading and causing the company to buy back its own stock at artificially inflated prices 

two purported class action complaints have been filed by purported purchasers of the company’s securities against the company and certain of its senior officers asserting claims under the federal securities laws the first was filed by raphael nach in the us district court for the northern district of illinois on july 19 2007 the second was filed by teamsters local 282 pension trust fund in the us district court for the southern district of new york on september 26 2007 both actions have been consolidated into a single proceeding entitled in re moody’s corporation securities litigation in the us district court for the southern district of new york on june 27 2008 a consolidated amended complaint was filed purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the company’s securities during the 

  

   

period february 3 2006 through october 24 2007 plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false andor misleading statements concerning the company’s business conduct business prospects business conditions and financial results relating primarily to mis’s ratings of structured finance products including rmbs cdo and constantproportion debt obligations the plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case the company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in september 2008 on february 23 2009 the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims and sustaining others 

for claims litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability is expected to be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate in other instances because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic 740 of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

the company cannot predict the ultimate impact that any of the legislative regulatory enforcement or litigation matters may have on how its business is conducted and thus its competitive position financial position or results of operations based on its review of the latest information available in the opinion of management the ultimate monetary liability of the company for the pending matters referred to above other than the legacy tax matters that are discussed under the section entitled “contingencies” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k  is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position although it is possible that the effect could be material to the company’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period

beginning in january 2008 moody’s segments were changed to reflect the reorganization announced in august 2007 as a result of the reorganization the rating agency is reported in the mis segment and several ratings business lines were realigned all of moody’s other nonrating commercial activities are represented in the ma segment 

as part of the reorganization there were several realignments within the mis lobs sovereign and subsovereign ratings which were previously part of financial institutions infrastructureutilities ratings which were previously part of corporate finance and project finance which was previously part of structured finance were combined with the public finance business to form a new lob called public project and infrastructure finance in addition real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business furthermore in august 2008 the global managed investments ratings group previously part of the structured finance business was combined with the financial institutions business 

in 2008 within ma various aspects of the legacy mis research business and mkmv business were combined to form the subscriptions software and professional services businesses the subscriptions business included credit and economic research data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk securities pricing and valuation software products and the professional services business included advisory services associated with risk modeling credit scorecard development and other specialized analytical projects as well as credit training and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a perengagement basis subscription services are typically sold for an initial 12month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods 

in 2009 the aforementioned ma businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit structure for the ma segment at december 31 2009 pursuant to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed research data and analytics and the software business was renamed risk management software the revised groupings classify certain subscriptionbased risk management software revenue and advisory services relating to software sales to the redefined rms business 

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets restructuring liabilities pension and other postretirement benefits utbs and stockbased compensation actual 

  

   

results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

revenue recognition 

in recognizing revenue related to ratings mis uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between the initial assignment of ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where mis does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods in such cases mis defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods the portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers the monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities currently the estimated monitoring periods range from one to ten years at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 deferred revenue included approximately 45 million 48 million and 54 million respectively related to such monitoring fees 

additionally in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities derivatives international residential mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods ranging from three to 51 years which are based on the expected lives of the rated securities at december 31 2009 at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately 78 million 82 million and 86 million respectively 

mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 accounts receivable included approximately 27 million 34 million and 38 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 

revenue earned within the ma segment is recognized as follows subscriptionbased revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period which is typically for an initial 12month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods beginning upon delivery of the initial product software revenue is recognized at time of delivery which is considered to have occurred upon transfer of the product master or first copy if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs professional service revenue is generally recognized at the time services are performed 

certain revenue arrangements within the ma segment include multiple elements such as software licenses maintenance subscription fees and professional services in these types of arrangements the fee is allocated to the various products or services based on objective measurements of fair value that is generally the price charged when sold separately—or vendorspecific objective evidence 

accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue based on historical experience and current conditions such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance billing adjustments and uncollectible account writeoffs are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in amounts that are greater or less than estimates each quarter the company revises its provision rates for billing adjustments and uncollectible accounts to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate accounts receivable allowance 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in the “contingencies” section of this “mda” commencing on page 51 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where 

  

   

deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities based on its review of the latest information available and subject to the contingencies described in item 7 “mda—contingencies” the ultimate monetary liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated financial position although it is possible that the effect could be material to the company’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period 

for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the provision for income taxes reflected credits of 43 million 87 million and 273 million respectively due to changes in the company’s liabilities for legacy tax exposures that were assumed by moody’s in connection with its separation from old db in october 2000 these tax matters are more fully described under the caption “legacy tax matters” within item 7 “mda” 

goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment annually as of november 30 th or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with asc topic 350 these impairment indicators could include significant events or circumstances that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit during 2009 there was a change in the reporting unit structure of ma to reflect the realignment under which the ma segment is currently managed accordingly it was determined that ma had three reporting units within its segment rda rms and training the rda reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools the rms reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software that is sold on a license or subscription basis as well as related advisory services for implementation and maintenance the training reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training as such at the date of the impairment test the company had four primary reporting units mis which encompasses the company’s ratings operations and the aforementioned three reporting units within ma 

the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a twostep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level by asc topic 350 intangibles—goodwill and other in the first step the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company must perform a second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and appropriate market comparables the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable however as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from these estimates in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 

as a result of the reporting structure realignment in the ma segment described above the company reassigned the assets and liabilities of the ma segment to each of its reporting units goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 

based on the result of the above test the company does not believe any of its reporting units are at risk of failing step 1 of the impairment test as the fair value for all reporting units is well in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value 

  

   

the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of november 30 2009 

 

 the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology the results of the dcf are evaluated against comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples in order to assess the reasonableness of the dcf fair values the dcf analysis requires significant judgments regarding the derivation of fair value including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments 

the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology which requires significant management judgment 

 

  

 amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the difficult market and economic conditions in 2009 resulted in lower than anticipated revenue for the rms and training reporting units compared to forecasted results causing the company to test the intangible assets within these reporting units for impairment at november 30 2009 this test was performed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows of each asset group that contained the aforementioned intangible assets to the carrying amount of the asset group the undiscounted cash flows were sufficient to cover the carrying value of the asset group and resulted in an excess of 39 and 48 for the rms and training reporting units respectively 

  

   

restructuring 

the company has engaged in restructuring actions which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs contract termination costs and asset impairments if the actual amounts differ from these estimates the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted for both the 2007 restructuring plan and the 2009 restructuring plan there have not been any significant differences between original estimates and actual amounts recorded upon completion of both plans for a full description of moody’s restructuring actions refer to the “results of operations” section below and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

 the discount rate selected to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligations as of december 31 2009 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares the plans’ projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows are then discounted back to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s postretirement plans 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise the company amortizes as a component of annual pension expense total outstanding gain or loss over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gainloss exceeds 10 of the greater of the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets for moody’s postretirement plans the total losses as of december 31 2009 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 550 million and moody’s expects to recognize net periodic pension expense of 33 million in 2010 for the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2009 the company has an unrecognized asset loss of 207 million of which 63 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2011 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2010 operating income these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2010 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s postretirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  

 a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2010 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to postretirement plans will be 216 million in 2010 compared with 145 million in 2009 the expected expense increase in 2010 reflects the effects of higher benefit obligations primarily due to assumption changes such as higher cash balance interest crediting rate and lower discount rates as well as higher amortization of actuarial losses 

  

   

stockbased compensation 

the company records compensation expense for all sharebased payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans stock options restricted stock and stock appreciation rights the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company which is limited the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 

an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2009 dollars in millions 

 

 income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

moody’s is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses 

for utp’s asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

for certain of its foreign subsidiaries the company has deemed a portion of the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested within its foreign operations accordingly the company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings a future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability for the company which may be material to moody’s future reported results financial position and cash flows 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated dividend distributions from nonus subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s 

  

   

operating segments 

beginning in january 2008 moody’s segments were changed to reflect the reorganization announced in august 2007 as a result of the reorganization the rating agency is reported in the mis segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned all of moody’s other nonrating commercial activities are represented in the ma segment 

as part of the reorganization there were several realignments within the mis lobs sovereign and subsovereign ratings which were previously part of financial institutions infrastructureutilities ratings which were previously part of corporate finance and project finance which was previously part of structured finance were combined with the public finance business to form a new lob called public project and infrastructure finance in addition real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business furthermore in august 2008 the global managed investments ratings group previously part of the structured finance business was combined with the financial institutions business 

the mis segment now consists of four lines of business—structured finance corporate finance financial institutions and public project and infrastructure finance—that generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide 

as part of the reorganization various aspects of the legacy mis research business and mkmv business were combined to form the subscriptions software and professional services businesses within ma the subscriptions business included credit and economic research data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis for an initial 12month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk securities pricing and valuation software products and the professional services business included credit training associated with risk modeling credit scorecard development and other specialized analytical projects as well as credit and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a perengagement basis 

in 2009 the aforementioned ma businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit structure for the ma segment at december 31 2009 pursuant to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed research data and analytics and the software business was renamed risk management software the revised groupings classify license software sales certain subscriptionbased risk management software revenue maintenance and advisory services relating to software sales to the redefined rms business the following tables are reconciliations of the revenue groupings previously disclosed to the new groupings for each of the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

   

   

the following is a discussion of the results of operations of these segments excluding the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content data and products developed by mis additionally overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company are allocated to each segment based on a revenuesplit methodology overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy information technology and support staff such as finance human resource information technology and legal 

in addition to its reported results moody’s has included in this mda certain adjusted results that the sec defines as “nongaap financial measures” management believes that such nongaap financial measures when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the company’s performance these nongaap financial measures relate to legacy tax matters and expenses and adjustments made to both the company’s 2007 and 2009 restructuring plans further described in note 17 and note 10 respectively to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation

executive summary 

moody’s revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 totaled 17972 million an increase of 418 million from 2008 excluding the negative impact from changes in fx translation rates revenue in 2009 increased 766 million compared to the same period in 2008 total expenses for 2009 were 11097 million an increase of 1025 million from 2008 and included approximately 32 million in favorable changes from fx translation rates operating income of 6875 million in 2009 decreased 607 million compared to 2008 excluding the impact of restructuring in both years operating income was 7050 million a decrease of 407 million from the prior year diluted eps of 169 in 2009 included a 005 unfavorable impact from restructuring actions and a 004 favorable impact relating to the resolution of a legacy tax matter excluding the aforementioned items in 2009 diluted eps of 170 decreased 012 or 7 from 182 in 2008 which excludes the prior year favorable pershare impacts of 001 and 004 for restructuring and the resolution of legacy tax matters respectively 

moody’s corporation 

the table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results followed by further insight and commentary 

 



  

   

the table below shows moody’s global staffing by geographic area 

 



global revenue of 17972 million in 2009 increased 418 million compared to 2008 with modest growth in both mis and ma the mis growth is reflective of gradual improvement in the credit markets throughout 2009 which resulted in increased issuance volumes for fundamental ratings particularly for investmentgrade and highyield corporate debt partially offset by continued declines in structured finance issuance the ma growth is primarily due to higher international rms revenue which resulted from the fermat acquisition made in the fourth quarter of 2008 excluding the negative impact from changes in fx translation rates moody’s revenue in 2009 increased 766 million compared to 2008 transaction revenue accounted for 37 of global mco revenue in 2009 compared to 36 in the prior year transaction revenue in the mis segment represents the initial rating of a new debt issuance as well as other onetime fees while relationship revenue represents the recurring monitoring of a rated debt obligation andor entities that issue such obligations as well as revenue from programs such as commercial paper mediumterm notes and shelf registrations in the ma segment relationship revenue represents subscriptionbased revenues and software maintenance revenue transaction revenue in ma represents software license fees and revenue from the professional services line of business which offers credit risk management advisory and training services which are typically sold on a perengagement basis 

in the us revenue increased 107 million with modest growth in mis being partially offset by declines in ma the increase in ratings revenue primarily reflects the aforementioned recovery in the investmentgrade and highyield corporate bond markets partially offset by declines in structured finance ratings revenue declined for all lobs within ma 

international revenue of 8764 million for 2009 was 311 million higher than 2008 and reflected growth in investmentgrade and highyield rated issuance within cfg as well as ma revenue which benefited from acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008 these increases were partially offset by significant declines in sfg revenue within mis as well as approximately 35 million in unfavorable impact from changes in fx translation rates 

total expenses for 2009 were 11097 million an increase of 1025 million from 2008 the increase primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008 costs associated with the 2009 restructuring plan and higher incentive compensation reflecting greater achievement against 2009 targeted results additionally there were higher rent and occupancy costs in 2009 related to the canary wharf lease in london higher professional services costs which include legal and it consulting as well as a charge for an international vat matter the aforementioned increases were partially offset by an approximate 32 million favorable impact from changes in fx translation rates 

operating expenses were 5324 million an increase of 391 million from the prior year resulting primarily from higher compensation costs of approximately 28 million compared to the same period in 2008 compensation costs were 4451 million an increase of 7 from prior year primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation costs due to greater achievement against 2009 targeted results noncompensation expenses in 2009 were 873 million an increase of approximately 11 million compared to the same period in 2008 the increase is due to higher professional service costs which include technology consulting costs associated with an investment in it infrastructure the increase in both compensation and noncompensation expenses were partially offset by favorable changes in fx translation rates 

sga expenses of 4957 million were 544 million higher than prior year the increase is primarily due to higher noncompensation costs which reflect higher rent expense relating to the canary wharf lease in london additional bad debt expense due to the deterioration of liquidity caused by general economic conditions higher professional services costs which include consulting as well as higher costs associated with investment in technology infrastructure compensation costs of 2501 million increased 7 over the same period in 2008 primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation costs due to greater achievement against 2009 targeted results 

restructuring expenses of 175 million in 2009 reflect costs associated with headcount reductions the divestiture of nonstrategic assets and contract terminations in accordance with the 2009 restructuring plan as well as adjustments to previous estimates for the 2007 restructuring plan the restructuring benefit of 25 million in 2008 reflects adjustments to previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the 2007 restructuring plan 

  

   

depreciation and amortization of 641 million decreased 110 million from 2008 primarily due to the following items in 2008 an approximate 11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets within the ma segment a 45 million writeoff of acquired inprocess technology related to the acquisition of fermat and approximately 4 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the company’s new jersey office the absence of these items in 2009 was partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets in 2009 associated with business acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008 

operating income of 6875 million decreased 607 million from prior year reflecting the 10 increase in operating expenses being partially offset by modest revenue increases excluding the impact of restructuring in both years operating income of 7050 million decreased 407 million changes in fx translation rates had a 3 million unfavorable impact on operating income in 2009 

interest expense income net for the year ended december 31 2009 was 334 million a decrease of 188 million compared to the same period in 2008 the change is due primarily to an interest expense reduction of approximately 12 million for tax and taxrelated liabilities recorded in the first quarter of 2009 coupled with a 65 million favorable resolution of a legacy tax matter in the second quarter of 2009 interest expense on borrowings decreased approximately 15 million compared to 2008 reflecting lower shortterm debt balances coupled with lower interest rates on borrowings under the 2007 facility and cp program during 2009 the company has utilized its operating cash flow to reduce shortterm borrowings by 38 additionally interest income decreased approximately 16 million compared to the same period in 2008 reflecting lower interest rate yields on cash and cash equivalents balances 

other nonoperating income expense net in 2009 was 79 million compared to 338 million in 2008 the change reflects fx losses of 95 million in 2009 compared to fx gains of 247 million in 2008 primarily reflecting the weakening of the euro to the british pound in 2009 relating to accounts receivable denominated in nonfunctional currencies as well as 11 million in favorable adjustments for legacy tax matters in 2008 

moody’s effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2009 was 370 or 30 bps higher than the prior year excluding legacy tax matters in both years the etr in 2009 of 376 increased 50 bps from 2008 

net income in 2009 was 4020 million or 169 per diluted share and decreased 556 million or 018 per diluted share compared to 2008 excluding the impact of restructuring and legacy tax matters in both years net income in 2009 decreased 406 million to 4047 million or 170 per diluted share from 182 in the same period of 2008 

segment results 

moody’s investors service 

the table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results followed by further analysis and commentary 

 



global mis revenue in 2009 of 12177 million increased 130 million or 359 million excluding unfavorable changes in fx translation rates compared to 2008 the increase from prior year reflects growth in rated issuance in the investmentgrade and highyield sectors of cfg coupled with increases in public and infrastructure ratings revenue within ppif these increases were partially offset by declines in new issuance in sfg and fig transaction revenue for total mis in 2009 was 50 compared to 49 in 2008 

in the us revenue was 6631 million an increase of 181 million or 3 from prior year reflecting strong growth in ratings of investment and speculativegrade corporate debt partially offset by new issuance declines which were significant in sfg and modest

restructuring expenses reflect costs associated with the 2009 restructuring plan as well as adjustments made to previous estimates for the 2007 restructuring plan 

depreciation and amortization of 313 million decreased 20 million from the prior year and was primarily due to the 2008 accelerated depreciation for the new jersey office facility closure being partially offset by higher depreciation relating to costs capitalized for ongoing it systems projects which were placed in service during 2009

market risk 

moody’s maintains operations in 26 countries outside the us in 2009 approximately 45 and 50 of the company’s revenue billed and expenses incurred respectively were in currencies other than the us dollar principally in the gbp and the euro as such the company is exposed to market risk from changes in fx rates 

as of december 31 2009 approximately 45 of moody’s assets were located outside the united states moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents of 4739 million at december 31 2009 consisted of approximately 404 million which was located outside the us making the company susceptible to fluctuations in fx rates additionally all of moody’s aggregate shortterm investments of 100 million were located outside the united states the effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar on assets and liabilities of nonus operations with nonus functional currencies are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment account in the statement of shareholders’ equity deficit 

moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in highquality investmentgrade securities within and outside the us with maturities of three months or less when purchased the company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of highgrade commercial paper shortterm investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit and high quality investmentgrade corporate bonds in korea the company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and shortterm investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer 

a portion of the company’s future billings and related revenue is exposed to market risk associated with changes in fx rates primarily related to the euro and gbp under the company’s current fx hedging program the company hedges a portion of fx currency risk for 

  

   

the purpose of reducing volatility in the company’s cash flows related to future euro and gbp billings and related revenue fx options and forwards are currently utilized to hedge these exposures and as of december 31 2009 have maturities between one and 11 months as of december 2009 all fx derivative contracts were deemed to be highly effective under topic 815 of the asc no credit losses are anticipated as the counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions and the company adheres to strict guidelines regarding the creditworthiness of its counterparties the fair value of the company’s outstanding fx derivative contracts was recorded within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and consisted of the following notional amounts 

 

 unrealized gains or losses are recorded in aoci and once realized the gains or losses will be recognized as an adjustment to revenue when the billings are recognized in revenue 

a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the exposure to fluctuations in the fx rates on moody’s fx options a hypothetical 10 favorable change in the overall option currency portfolio would result in a gain of approximately 28 million as of december 31 2009 the maximum loss related to an adverse change in the option currency portfolio would be 24 million 

as a result of the 2008 term loan completed on may 7 2008 the company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 1500 million to protect against fluctuations in the liborbased variable interest rate these swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded into aoci while net interest payments are recorded in the statement of operations at december 31 2009 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was 76 million and is recorded in other liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet the objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing this objective 

a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the exposure to fluctuations in the shortterm libor on moody’s interest expense relating to the 2008 term loan assuming the interest rate swap was not in place a hypothetical change of one percent in the libor would result in an impact on annual interest expense of approximately 15 million

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

adopted

during the period ending september 30 2009 the company adopted the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles which only affected the specific references to gaap literature in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

not yet adopted 

in june 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities this new standard eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity this new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities the company will adopt this new accounting standard as of january 1 2010 and does not expect the implementation to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in october 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements asu 200913 the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price the selling price for each deliverable is based on vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available the company has elected to early adopt asu 200913 on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified on or after january 1 2010 if applied in the same manner to the year ended december 31 2009 asu 200913 would not have had a material impact on net revenue reported for both its mis and ma segments in terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition the adoption of asu 200913 is also not expected to have a significant effect on the company’s net revenue in periods after the initial adoption when applied to multiple element arrangements based on its current pricing strategies 

in january 2010 the fasb issued asu no 201006 “improving disclosures about fair value measurements” the new standard requires disclosure regarding transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 classifications within the fair value hierarchy as well as requiring further detail of activity within the level 3 category of the fair value hierarchy the new standard also requires disclosures regarding the fair value for each class of assets and liabilities which is a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in a company’s balance sheet additionally the standard will require further disclosures surrounding inputs and valuation techniques used in fair value measurements the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years the company is currently evaluating the potential impact if any of the implementation of asu no 201006 on its consolidated financial statements

two purported class action complaints have been filed by purported purchasers of the company’s securities against the company and certain of its senior officers asserting claims under the federal securities laws the first was filed by raphael nach in the us district court for the northern district of illinois on july 19 2007 the second was filed by teamsters local 282 pension trust fund in the us district court for the southern district of new york on september 26 2007 both actions have been consolidated into a single proceeding entitled in re moody’s corporation securities litigation in the us district court for the southern district of new york on june 27 2008 a consolidated amended complaint was filed purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the company’s securities during the period february 3 2006 through october 24 2007 plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false andor misleading statements concerning the company’s business conduct business prospects business conditions and financial results relating primarily to mis’s ratings of structured finance products including rmbs cdo and constantproportion debt obligations the plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case the company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in september 2008 on february 23 2009 the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims and sustaining others 

for claims litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability is expected to be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate in other instances because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes 

  

   

available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic 740 of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

the company cannot predict the ultimate impact that any of the legislative regulatory enforcement or litigation matters may have on how its business is conducted and thus its competitive position financial position or results of operations based on its review of the latest information available in the opinion of management the ultimate monetary liability of the company for the pending matters referred to above other than the legacy tax matters that are discussed below is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position although it is possible that the effect could be material to the company’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period 

legacy tax matters 

moodys continues to have exposure to potential liabilities arising from legacy tax matters as of december 31 2009 moodys has recorded liabilities for legacy tax matters totaling 558 million this includes liabilities and accrued interest due to new db arising from the 2000 distribution agreement it is possible that the ultimate liability for legacy tax matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the company which could result in additional charges that may be material to moodys future reported results financial position and cash flows 

the following summary of the relationships among moodys new db and their predecessor entities is important in understanding our exposure to the legacy tax matters 

in november 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation separated into three separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation acnielsen corporation and cognizant corporation in june 1998 the dun  bradstreet corporation separated into two separate public companies old db and rh donnelley corporation during 1998 cognizant separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated and nielsen media research inc in september 2000 old db separated into two separate public companies new db and moody’s 

old db and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities old db and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable irs determinations on certain tax matters and certain other potential tax liabilities all as described in such agreements further in connection with the 2000 distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement new db and moody’s have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to these legacy tax matters 

settlement agreements were executed with the irs in 2005 regarding the legacy tax matters for the years 19891990 and 19931996 these settlements represent substantially all of the total potential liability to the irs including penalties as of december 31 2009 the company continues to carry a liability of 19 million for the remaining potential exposure in addition with respect to these settlement agreements moody’s and new db believe that ims health and nmr did not pay their full share of the liability to the irs pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements among the parties moody’s and new db paid these amounts to the irs on their behalf and attempted to resolve this dispute with ims health and nmr as a result moody’s and new db commenced arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr in connection with the 19891990 matter this matter was resolved during the third quarter of 2008 in favor of moody’s and new db resulting in ims health and nmr having paid a total of 67 million to moody’s in the second quarter of 2009 moodys and new db reached a settlement with ims health and nmr with respect to the 19931996 matter resulting in 108 million of cash proceeds paid to moodys of which 65 million represents interest and 43 million is a reduction of tax expense 

amortization expense deductions 

this legacy tax matter which was affected by developments in june 2007 and 2008 as further described below involves a partnership transaction which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of old db since 1997 irs audits of old db’s and new db’s tax returns for the years 1997 through 2002 concluded in june 2007 without any disallowance of the amortization expense deductions or any other adjustments to income related to this partnership transaction these audits resulted in the irs issuing the notices for other tax issues for the 19972000 years aggregating 95 million in tax and penalties plus statutory interest of approximately 6 million which should be apportioned among moody’s new db ims health and nmr pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements moody’s share of this assessment was 66 million including interest net of tax in november 2007 the irs assessed the tax and penalties and used a portion of the deposit discussed below to satisfy the assessment together with interest the company believes it has meritorious grounds to challenge the irs’s actions and is evaluating its alternatives to recover these amounts the absence of any tax deficiencies in the notices for the amortization expense deductions for the years 1997 through 2002 

  

   

combined with the expiration of the statute of limitations for 1997 through 2002 for issues not assessed resulted in moody’s recording an earnings benefit of 523 million in the second quarter of 2007 this is comprised of two components as follows i a reversal of a tax liability of 273 million related to the period from 1997 through the distribution date reducing the provision for income taxes and ii a reduction of accrued interest expense of 175 million 106 million net of tax and an increase in other nonoperating income of 144 million relating to amounts due to new db in june 2008 the statute of limitations for new db relating to the 2003 tax year expired as a result in the second quarter of 2008 moody’s recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of 23 million 14 million net of tax and an increase in other nonoperating income of 64 million relating to amounts due to new db as of december 31 2009 moodys carries a liability of 11 million with respect to this matter 

on the distribution date new db paid moody’s 550 million for 50 of certain anticipated future tax benefits of new db through 2012 it is possible that irs audits of new db for tax years after 2003 could result in income adjustments with respect to the amortization expense deductions of this partnership transaction in the event that these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by new db or there is an audit adjustment moody’s would be required pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement to repay to new db an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits and its share of any tax liability that new db incurs as of december 31 2009 moody’s liability with respect to this matter totaled 528 million 

in march 2006 new db and moody’s each deposited 398 million with the irs in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years in july 2007 new db and moody’s commenced procedures to recover approximately 57 million of these deposits 246 million for new db and 319 million for moody’s which represents the excess of the original deposits over the total of the deficiencies asserted in the notices as noted above in november 2007 the irs used 79 million of moody’s portion of the deposit to satisfy an assessment and related interest additionally in the first quarter of 2008 the irs returned to moody’s 331 million in connection with this matter which includes 30 million of interest in july 2008 the irs paid moody’s the remaining 18 million balance of the original deposit and in september 2008 the irs paid moody’s 02 million of interest on that balance

 item 1 business tableend background 

as used in this report except where the context indicates otherwise the terms “moody’s” or the “company” refer to moody’s corporation a delaware corporation and its subsidiaries the company’s executive offices are located at 7 world trade center at 250 greenwich street new york ny 10007 and its telephone number is 212 5530300 prior to september 30 2000 the company operated as part of the dun  bradstreet corporation 

the company 

moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings and related research data and analytical tools ii quantitative credit risk measures risk scoring software and credit portfolio management solutions and iii securities pricing software and valuation models in 2007 and prior years moody’s operated in two reportable segments moody’s investors service and moody’s kmv beginning in january 2008 moody’s segments were changed to reflect the reorganization announced in august 2007 as a result of the reorganization the rating agency remains in the mis operating segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned all of moody’s other nonrating commercial activities including mkmv and sales of mis research are now combined under a new operating segment known as moody’s analytics moody’s now reports in two new reportable segments mis and ma financial information and operating results of these segments including revenue expenses operating income and total assets are included in part ii item 8 financial statements of this annual report and are herein incorporated by reference 

the mis segment publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide including various corporate and governmental obligations structured finance securities and commercial paper programs revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis’s ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to investors mis provides ratings in more than 110 countries ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media including the internet and realtime information systems widely used by securities traders and investors as of december 31 2008 mis had ratings relationships with approximately 13000 corporate issuers and approximately 26000 public finance issuers additionally the company has rated and currently monitors ratings on approximately 109000 structured finance obligations 

the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the credit risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets these offerings include quantitative credit risk scores credit processing software economic research analytical models financial data securities pricing software and valuation models and specialized consulting services ma also distributes investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its rating process including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies and commentary on topical events ma clients represent more than 5000 institutions worldwide operating in approximately 120 countries over 30000 client users and more than 200000 individuals accessed moody’s research web site 

the company operated as part of “old db” until september 30 2000 when old db separated into two publicly traded companies – moody’s corporation and new db at that time old db distributed to its shareholders shares of new db stock new db comprised the business of old db’s dun  bradstreet operating company the remaining business of old db consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services and was renamed moody’s corporation for purposes of governing certain ongoing relationships between the company and new db after the 2000 distribution and to provide for an orderly transition the company and new db entered into various agreements including a distribution agreement tax allocation agreement and employee benefits agreement 

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly in terms of outstanding principal amount and types of securities or other obligations despite the recent market disruption and significant declines in issuance activity for many classes of securities in the us and internationally moody’s believes that the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued secular growth of fixedincome markets worldwide however moody’s expects that in the nearterm growth drivers such as financial innovation and disintermediation will slow as capital market participants adjust to the recent poor performance of some structured finance asset classes such as us rmbs and credit derivatives restoring investor confidence in structured products may require further enhancements to mis’s rating processes and may be facilitated by greater transparency from issuers of 

  

   

structured or securitized debt mis has developed updated rating methodologies volatility measures and pricing and valuation services to aid the return of investor trust moody’s expects that these initiatives will support continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions 

growth in global fixedincome markets is attributable to a number of forces and trends advances in information technology such as the internet make information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world this technology facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets issuers and investors are also more readily able to obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell many of which may be unfamiliar to them this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and development of worldwide financial markets and a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk as a result existing capital markets have expanded and a number of new capital markets have emerged in addition more issuers and investors are accessing developed capital markets 

another trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets recent credit market disruptions have slowed the trend of disintermediation globally but moody’s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems thus disintermediation is expected to expand in the longerterm 

the strong growth trend seen in the issuance of structured finance securities reversed dramatically in 2008 due to the market turmoil the market disruptions that escalated in 2008 are expected to continue in the immediate term and moody’s expects to see a continued decline in revenue from this market in 2009 however although the extent and scale are unclear moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global credit markets and provide opportunities for longer term growth moody’s will continue to monitor and support the progress of this market and adapt to meet the changing needs 

rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the volume and number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets that it rates moody’s is therefore affected by for example the performance and the prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decision process however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings subscriptionbased research and other areas are less dependent on or independent of the volume or number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets 

moody’s operations are also subject to various risks inherent in carrying on business internationally such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources however the formation of for example a new governmentsponsored regional or global rating agency would pose a risk to moody’s growth prospects management believes that this risk compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry is relatively low because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required with uncertainty about the likelihood of financial success 

legislative bodies and regulators in both the us europe and selective other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of cras which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of mis or increased costs of doing business for moody’s therefore in order to broaden the potential for expansion of nonratings services moody’s reorganized in january 2008 into two distinct businesses mis consisting solely of the ratings business and ma moody’s analytics conducts all nonratings activities and includes the mkmv and fermat businesses the sale of credit research produced by mis and the production and sale of other credit related products and services the reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by ma into activities which were previously restricted due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities see “regulation” below 

  

   

ma expects to benefit from the growing demand among credit market participants for information that enables them to make sound investment and risk management decisions these customers require advanced qualitative and quantitative tools to support their management of increasingly complex capital market instruments such complexity creates analytical challenges for market participants including financial intermediaries asset managers and other investors in recent years reliable thirdparty ratings and research served to supplement or substitute for traditional inhouse research as the scale geographic scope and complexity of financial markets grew recent disruptions in credit markets threaten to slow this trend but moody’s expects to sustain reliance on its offerings as enhancements to credit rating methodologies and other changes in securities origination processes restore investor confidence and more orderly market operations 

growth in ma is also expected as financial institutions adopt active credit portfolio management practices and implement internal credit assessment tools for compliance with basel ii regulations ma offers products that respond to these needs this growth will be realized by for example the development of new private firm default probability models for specific countries and by expanding analysis capabilities of new asset classes 

competition 

the mis business competes with other credit rating agencies and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research many of moody’s customers also have inhouse credit research capabilities moody’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp’s in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp moody’s competitors include fitch a subsidiary of fimalac sa dominion bond rating service ltd of canada “dbrs” am best company inc japan credit rating agency ltd rating and investment information inc of japan ri and eganjones ratings company in 2008 two more firms were granted the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations status lace financial corp in february and realpoint llc in june one or more additional rating agencies may emerge in the us as the sec continues to expand the number of nrsros competition may also increase in developed or developing markets outside the us over the next few years as the number of rating agencies increases 

the increased regulatory focus on credit risk presents both opportunities and challenges for moody’s global demand for credit ratings and risk management services may rise but regulatory actions may result in a greater number of rating agencies andor additional regulation of moody’s and its competitors alternatively banking or securities market regulators could seek to reduce the use of ratings in regulations thereby reducing certain elements of demand for ratings or otherwise seek to control the analysis or business of rating agencies 

credit rating agencies such as mis also compete with other means of managing credit risk such as credit insurance competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk also may pose a competitive threat to moody’s 

ma competes broadly in the financial information space against diversified competitors such as thomsonreuters bloomberg riskmetrics sp fitch dun  bradstreet and markit group among others ma’ main competitors within credit risk management include fitch algorithmics sungard sas iflex and riskmetrics group as well as a host of smaller vendors and inhouse solutions in economic analysis data and modeling services ma faces competition from ihs global insight oxford economics haver analytics and a number of smaller firms around the world within credit services moody’s competes with mercer oliver wyman for certain credit risk consulting with omega performance dc gardner and a host of boutique providers for financial training and creditsights gimme credit and other smaller providers for independent credit research in securities analytics and valuation moody’s competes against interactive data corporation thomsonreuters sp fitch markit group cme intex and many other smaller providers 

moody’s strategy 

moody’s continues to follow growth strategies that adapt to market conditions and capitalize on emerging opportunities 

given recent market turmoil moody’s immediate focus is on making effective business decisions to adjust for the expected reduction in revenue while positioning the company to benefit from an eventual recovery in global credit market activity 

in a world of renewed attention to risk analysis and risk management moody’s is committed to further encouraging the informed use of credit ratings research and related analytics products 

  

   

moody’s seeks to differentiate itself from incumbent and potential competitors with uniquely thoughtful forwardlooking and accurate opinions about credit and the credit industry 

adapting to market change is a key factor in maintaining market relevance moody’s continuously monitors opportunities to selectively diversify its revenue base through organic growth and acquisitions in order to replace lost revenue and position moody’s for new sources of business 

in support of those goals moody’s intends to continue its focus in the following areas 

expansion in financial centers 

moody’s serves its customers through its global network of offices and business affiliations moody’s currently maintains comprehensive rating and marketing operations in financial centers including dubai frankfurt hong kong london madrid milan moscow new york paris singapore sydney and tokyo moody’s expects that its global network will position it to benefit from the expansion of worldwide capital markets and thereby increase revenue moody’s also expects that the growth of its mis business as a consequence of financial market integration in europe will return additionally moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures this will allow moody’s to extend its credit opinion franchise to local and regional obligors through domestic currency ratings and national scale ratings 

new rating products 

moody’s continues to respond to investor demand for new products and enhancements in the recent market turmoil attention to core strengths has been crucial and enhancements have and continue to be focused on quality and transparency given the particular disruption in the structured finance markets mis has been developing enhanced structured finance offerings to meet investor demands for more information content leveraging the diversity of its research data and analytics moody’s has introduced crosssector analysis to better illustrate the broader impacts of recent market events this is further enhanced by the incorporation of macroeconomics to frame conditions and assumptions mis continues to capitalize on market developments and enhance ratings surveillance efficiency focusing on new ratings products such as hedge fund operations quality ratings and to identify design develop and maintain valueadded research analytics and data products serving the capital markets 

internetenhanced products and services 

moody’s is expanding its use of the internet and other electronic media to enhance client service moody’s website provides the public with instant access to ratings and provides the public and subscribers with credit research internet delivery also enables moody’s to provide services to more individuals within a client organization than were available with paperbased products and to offer highervalue services because of more timely delivery moody’s expects that access to these applications will increase client use of moody’s services moody’s expects to continue to invest in electronic media to capitalize on these and other opportunities 

expansion of credit research products and investment analytic tools 

moody’s plans to expand its research and analytic services through internal development and through acquisitions most new product initiatives tend to be more analytical and dataintensive than traditional narrative research offerings such services address investor interest in replicating the monitoring activities conducted by for example moody’s securitization analysts and provide the means for customers to gain access to raw data and adjusted financial statistics and ratios used by moody’s analysts in the rating process for municipalities companies and financial institutions these products represent important sources of growth for the research business ma is developing products in the fixedincome valuations and pricing arena that facilitate price transparency in global fixed income markets especially for complex structured securities and derivative instruments moreover moody’s continues to explore opportunities to extend its research relevance in new domestic or regional markets eg china as well as new functional markets eg hedge funds 

new quantitative credit risk assessment services 

moody’s will continue to provide banks and other institutions with quantitative credit risk assessment services moody’s believes that there will be increased demand for such services because they assist customers trading or holding creditsensitive assets to better manage risk and deliver better performance also international bank regulatory authorities are assessing the 

  

   

adequacy of banks’ internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining regulatory capital the acquisition of fermat accelerates moody’s developments in this area such regulatory initiatives create demand for and encourage adoption of related services by banks from thirdparty providers 

regulation 

in the us since 1975 mis has been designated as an nrsro by the sec the sec first applied the nrsro designation in that year to companies whose credit ratings could be used by brokerdealers for purposes of determining their net capital requirements since that time congress the sec and other governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of nrsros to distinguish between among other things “investmentgrade” and “noninvestmentgrade” securities 

in september 2006 the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 was passed which created a voluntary registration process for rating agencies wishing to be designated as nrsros the reform act provides the sec with authority to oversee nrsros while prohibiting the sec from regulating the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any nrsro determines credit ratings in june 2007 the sec published its first set of rules under the reform act these rules address the nrsro application and registration process as well as oversight rules related to recordkeeping financial reporting prevention of misuse of material nonpublic information conflicts of interest and prohibited acts and practices in june 2007 mis filed its application for registration as an nrsro with the sec in september 2007 the sec registered mis as an nrsro under the securities exchange act of 1934 and as of that time mis has been subject to the sec’s oversight rules described above as required by the rules mis has made its form nrsro initial application its annual certification of form nrsro and any associated updates publicly available by posting it on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

in july 2008 the sec released a report on its examination of cras the sec began its review of the ratings processes and procedures of the three leading rating agencies — mis sp and fitch — in august 2007 focusing on subprime rmbs and cdos while the commission’s staff noted that most of the period under review predated the implementation of sec rules for the industry the report identified areas that were either of concern to the sec or that the sec believed could be enhanced goingforward the concerns identified by the commission’s staff generally fall into three categories policies addressing potential conflicts of interest resources and resource allocation documentation around policies and procedures and enhancing transparency the sec also summarized the various steps that are already being put in place by the rating agencies as well as those that are under consideration in the sec’s current rulemaking process 

in february 2009 the sec published a second set of final rules applicable to nrsros as well as additional proposed rules these final rules and rule proposals were approved by the commission in early december 2008 the majority of the final rules address managing conflicts of interest enhancing record keeping requirements and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies the deadline for market comment on the new proposed rules is march 26 2009 mis will submit comments to the sec by this deadline 

finally both chambers of the congress are reviewing the broader us regulatory infrastructure and as part of this review the role and function of cras will continue to be studied for example as part of a series of hearings focusing on the existing market turmoil on october 22 2008 the house committee on oversight and government reform held a hearing on the role of credit rating agencies mis has participated in this and other hearings and the written testimonies can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

internationally several regulatory developments have occurred 

the group of 7 and the group of 20 — the g7 finance ministers and central bank governors formally asked the fsf to analyze the underlying causes of the recent financial market turbulence one area for analysis was the role and use of credit rating in the structured finance market to encourage the adoption of a unified regulatory approach the fsf has coordinated the work of other international organizations on these subjects the fsf’s recommendations on the cra industry are as follows improve the quality of the rating process and management of conflicts of interest in rating structured finance securities differentiate ratings on structured finance products from those on corporate and government bonds and expand the initial and ongoing information provided on the risk characteristics of structured products and enhance their review of the quality of the data input and due diligence performed on underlying assets by originators arrangers and issuers 

in november 2008 the heads of state of the g20 reached agreement on a wideranging set of proposals to better regulate financial systems among other things the g20 committed to implement oversight of the cras consistent with the strength 

  

   

ened international code of conduct see below and agreed that in the medium term the countries should implement a registration system for cras the g20 also committed to formulate their regulations and other measures in a consistent manner and recommended that the international organization of securities regulators should review cras’ adoption of the standards and mechanisms for monitoring compliance 

iosco — in december 2004 the technical committee of iosco published its code of conduct fundamentals for credit rating agencies in march 2008 iosco published for public consultation a report on the role of cras in structured finance as well as a proposal to amend the iosco code of conduct fundamentals for cras working with four other globally active cras mis submitted a joint response to iosco’s consultation report this joint response can be found on the regulatory affairs webpage of the company’s website in may 2008 iosco finalized its report and published the revised iosco code at its annual meeting in may 2008 the changes made to the iosco code broadly address greater transparency of methodologies and processes by cras on july 2008 iosco also announced that it will monitor the cras implementation of the iosco code changes and it will explore the means by which iosco members might work together to verify the proper and complete disclosure by cras of information required by the iosco code finally in september iosco announced that it would discuss at its next technical committee meeting held in january 2009 measures that would aim to bring about more globally consistent oversight of cras 

mis initially published its code of professional conduct pursuant to the iosco code in june 2005 and published an updated version in october 2007 in november 2008 mis revised its code to reflect the changes made to the iosco code beginning in 2006 mis has annually published a report that describes its implementation of the code the mis code and the three annual reports that have been published thus far can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

eu — the european commission presently is reexamining the regulatory framework for rating agencies in europe on july 31 2008 the commission published a consultation document seeking comments on proposals with respect to regulating rating agencies that operate in the eu specifically the commission sought comments on the authorization supervision and enforcement rules for rating agencies that operate within the eu over 90 respondents provided the commission with their views on the suggested framework mis’s comments on the proposal are posted on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

in november 2008 the commission introduced proposed regulation for the oversight of cras “proposed regulation” the document is primarily based on the iosco code but with important differences particularly the commission has introduced additional conduct and governance regulation the proposed regulation is now being considered by eu member states — under the leadership of the presidency of the council of the eu — and by the european parliament both bodies have the ability to introduce significant modifications to the commission’s original proposed text 

it is as yet too early to assess the form and content of this reevaluation process 

the basel committee — in june 2004 the basel committee on banking supervision published a new bank capital adequacy framework called basel ii to replace its initial 1988 framework under basel ii ratings assigned by recognized cras or ecais can be used by banks in determining credit risk weights for many of their institutional credit exposures recognized ecais could be subject to a broader range of oversight national authorities have begun the ecai recognition process mis has been recognized as an ecai in several jurisdictions and the recognition process is ongoing in many others mis does not currently believe that basel ii will materially affect its financial position or results of operations as a result of the recent regulatory activity the banking authorities of the basel committee are reconsidering the overall basel ii framework it is as yet too early to assess the form and content of this reevaluation 

other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future in addition in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which mis operates the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of mis cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

approximately 49 of mis’ revenue for 2008 was transactionbased compared to 68 of mis’ revenue in 2007 revenue from rating transactions in turn is dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets accordingly any conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings 

a significant disruption in world financial markets particularly in the credit markets that began in mid2007 worsened materially in the second half of 2008 particularly in the latter portion of the year when many credit markets experienced a severe lack of liquidity these credit market disruptions together with the current economic slowdown have negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings consequently the company has experienced a substantial reduction in the demand for rating newly issued debt securities resulting in a 32 decrease in mis revenue for 2008 compared to 2007 the timing and nature of any recovery in the credit and other financial markets remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the future or that financial results will not continue to be adversely affected a sustained period of market decline or weakness especially if it relates to credit sensitive securities for which there is typically a high level of demand for ratings could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business and financial results initiatives that the company has undertaken to reduce costs may not be sufficient to offset the results of a prolonged or more severe downturn and further cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the near term due in part to rent technology and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further the costreduction initiatives undertaken to date could result in strains in the company’s operations if the credit markets and demand for ratings return to levels that prevailed prior to mid2007 or otherwise unexpectedly surge 

other factors that could further reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities include increases in interest rates or credit spreads continued volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment significant regulatory political or economic events the use of alternative sources of credit including financial institutions and government sources defaults of significant issuers and other unfavorable market and economic conditions 

regulation as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization and potential for new domestic and overseas legislation and regulations 

credit rating agencies are regulated in both the us and in other countries including by state and local authorities currently moody’s is designated as an nrsro pursuant to sec regulation enacted in response to the adoption of the reform act one of the central promises of the reform act was to encourage competition among rating agencies given its adoption moody’s is unable to assess the future impact of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec’s regulations or the impact on moody’s competitive position or its current practices possible consequences of these new regulations include issues that may affect all entities engaged in the rating agency business such as expected increased costs or issues that may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner any of these changes could negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or the markets for its products and services in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict 

in addition over the past year both the g7 and the g20 finance ministers and central bank governors have sought to analyze and arrive at a consistent approach for addressing the various areas of the financial market and have made a variety of recommendations as to regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings finance ministers have also agreed to register rating agencies in their home jurisdiction as a result of the internationally coordinated activity individual countries likely will begin implementing registration regimes for the oversight of cras in the coming years in particular the european commission presently is reexamining the regulatory framework for rating agencies in europe in november 2008 the 

  

   

commission published a draft regulation for the oversight of regulating rating agencies that operate in the eu it is as yet too early to assess the form and content of this reevaluation as with the recent regulatory initiatives in the us these initiatives may affect all entities engaged in the rating agency business or may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner and could negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or the markets for its products and services in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict 

in addition to the foregoing many legislative and regulatory agencies both in the us and in other countries have been studying or pursuing new laws and regulations addressing cras and the use of credit ratings it is possible that such initiatives could lead to additional laws or regulations affecting moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or the markets for its products and services this could include adopting regulations that require debt securities to be rated establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings which could negatively affect competition among rating agencies the level of demand for ratings or the company’s ability to provide objective assessments of creditworthiness additional regulations could potentially increase the costs associated with the operation of a cra alter the rating agencies’ communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings change the regulatory framework to which cras are subject and affect the competitive environment in which cras operate 

as existing laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and new laws or regulations are adopted the costs of compliance may increase and moody’s may not be able to pass these costs through the pricing of its products in addition increased regulatory uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of laws and regulations may increase costs decrease demand or affect the manner in which moody’s or its customers or users of credit ratings operate or alter the economics of the credit ratings business by restricting or mandating the business models under which an nrsro is permitted to operate 

a description of several of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the us and other countries is described above under the section entitled “regulation” in item 1 “business” of this form 10k 

legal economic and regulatory risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions 

moody’s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant and increasing portion of its revenue from sources outside the us in addition to the regulatory risks discussed above operations in different countries expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into us dollars and currency fluctuations us laws affecting overseas operations including regulations applicable under the office of foreign asset control and the foreign corrupt practices act domestic and foreign export and import restrictions tariffs and other trade barriers political and economic instability the possibility of nationalization expropriation price controls and other restrictive governmental actions longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables and potentially adverse tax consequences 

in addition to competition from other rating agencies that operate in a number of international jurisdictions and specialized companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company inc with respect to the insurance industry in many foreign countries moody’s will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence and greater familiarity or a longer operating history in those markets these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions that moody’s does not receive putting moody’s at a competitive disadvantage 

uncertain impact of government actions to stabilize financial institutions and markets 

the us government announced several programs in 2008 including the emergency economic stabilization act the october 14 2008 joint statement by the us treasury federal reserve and fdic announcing the troubled asset relief program through which the government is authorized to purchase up to 700 billion in whole loans and mortgagerelated securities as well as to invest directly in financial institutions the treasury department’s money market mutual fund guaranty program the federal reserve’s commercial paper funding facility and payment of interest on reserve balances the fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program and the february 10 2009 statement by the us treasury additionally the governments of many nations and international organizations such as the international monetary fund have announced similar measures for institutions and countries around the world there is no assurance that these programs individually or collectively will have beneficial effects in the credit markets will address credit or liquidity issues of companies that participate in the programs will reduce volatility or uncertainty in the financial markets or will reverse or moderate the slowdown and downturn of world economies the failure of these programs to have their intended effects could have a material adverse effect on the financial markets which in turn could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations in addition these and 

  

   

similar initiatives could reduce the demand for ratings of credit securities or other financial products could result in increased government regulation of such markets and could have other unanticipated adverse effects on the markets for and demand for debt securities andor for ratings of such instruments 

increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service at the same time bankruptcies and consolidation of customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of customers while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and service if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors moody’s may lose market share 

introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies 

the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are highly competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and to utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by the company customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and the company’s growth prospects in addition moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by limitations of its information technologies that fail to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors 

exposure to litigation related to moody’s rating opinions 

currently moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities as part of ongoing investigations and is cooperating with those inquiries in addition moody’s faces litigation from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions as well as other related actions in these difficult economic times when the value of creditdependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased the number of investigations and legal proceedings moody’s is facing has increased these proceedings impose additional expenses on the company which may increase over time as these matters progress procedurally require the attention of senior management to an extent that may reduce their ability to devote significant time addressing other business issues and may result in fines or damages if we are deemed to have violated any laws or regulations as moody’s international business expands these types of claims may increase or become more costly because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as provided by the first amendment and may pose criminal rather than civil penalties for noncompliance these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and we may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover them and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time 

exposure to reputational and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation is one of the key bases on which the company competes to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or that moody’s relative to its competitors suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be adversely affected factors that could affect credibility include potentially the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities by a particular rating agency the timing and nature of changes in ratings adverse publicity as to the ratings process and the appearance of a conflict of interest 

possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures 

moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by offering higher compensation than moody’s or providing more favorable working conditions moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis moody’s may also lose key employees due to other factors such as catastrophes that could lead to disruption of business operations moody’s ability to compete effectively will continue to depend among other things on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees 

  

   

moody’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located this may include a disruption involving electrical communications or other services used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business whether due to human error natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage computer viruses intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism or war or otherwise moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of major operating systems may not be successful the company does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations its ability to service and interact with moody’s clients and customers may suffer 

the company’s operations also rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks although moody’s takes protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant its computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses or other malicious events that could have a security impact if one or more of such events occur this could jeopardize moody’s or its clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through its computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s its clients’ its counterparties’ or third parties’ operations moody’s may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures and the company may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by moody’s

two purported class action complaints have been filed by purported purchasers of the company’s securities against the company and certain of its senior officers asserting claims under the federal securities laws the first was filed by raphael nach in the us district court for the northern district of illinois on july 19 2007 the second was filed by teamsters local 282 pension trust fund in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on september 26 2007 both actions have been consolidated into a single proceeding entitled in re moody’s corporation securities litigation in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on june 27 2008 a consolidated amended complaint was filed purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the company’s securities during the period february 3 2006 through october 24 2007 plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false andor misleading statements concerning the company’s business conduct business prospects business conditions and financial results relating primarily to mis’s ratings of structured finance products including rmbs cdo and constantproportion debt obligations the plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case the company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in september 2008 on february 23 2009 the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims sustaining others and granting plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint by march 18 2009 

for claims litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate in other instances because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of fin 48 implemented as of january 1 2007 which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

based on its review of the latest information available and subject to the contingencies described in item 7 “mda – contingencies” the ultimate monetary liability of the company for the pending matters referred to above other than legacy tax matters that are discussed in part ii item 7 “mda – contingencies “ is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition although it is possible that the effect could be material to the company’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period this opinion is subject to the contingencies described in part ii item 7 “mda — contingencies”

the following graph compares the total cumulative shareholder return of the company to the performance of standard  poor’s stock 500 index an index of performance peer group companies the “performance peer group” and the russell 3000 financial services index 

the company is electing to use the russell 3000 financial services index which is accessible to our shareholders in newspapers the internet and other readily available sources for purposes of the following graph the company previously utilized the performance peer group which is a custom composite index of peer issuers that were selected in good faith at december 31 2008 this performance peer group consisted of the mcgrawhill companies pearson plc thomsonreuters corporation and wolters kluwer nv late in 2007 dow jones  company inc was acquired by news corporation and in 2008 reuters group plc was acquired by thomson corporation as a result of these changes and because of the limited number of companies contained in the performance peer group index the company believes that the index previously utilized is not as representative for comparison purposes as the russell 3000 financial services index 

the comparison assumes that 10000 was invested in the company’s common stock and in each of the foregoing indices on december 31 2003 the comparison also assumes the reinvestment of dividends if any the total return for the common stock was 31 during the performance period as compared with a total return during the same period of 10 for the sp 500 48 for the russell 3000 financial services index and 19 for the performance peer group

the mis segment publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide including various corporate and governmental obligations structured finance securities and commercial paper programs revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis’s ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to investors mis provides ratings in more than 110 countries ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media including the internet and realtime information systems widely used by securities traders and investors as of december 31 2008 mis had ratings relationships with approximately 13000 corporate issuers and approximately 26000 public finance issuers additionally the company has rated and currently monitors ratings on approximately 109000 structured finance obligations

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly in terms of outstanding principal amount and types of securities or other obligations despite the recent market disruption and significant declines in issuance activity for many classes of securities in the us and internationally moody’s believes that the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued secular growth of fixedincome markets worldwide however moody’s expects that in the nearterm growth drivers such as financial innovation and disintermediation will slow as capital market participants adjust to the recent poor performance of some structured finance asset classes such as us rmbs and credit derivatives restoring investor confidence in structured products may require further enhancements to mis’s rating processes and may be facilitated by greater transparency from issuers of 

  

   

structured or securitized debt mis has developed updated rating methodologies volatility measures and pricing and valuation services to aid the return of investor trust moody’s expects that these initiatives will support continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions 

growth in global fixedincome markets is attributable to a number of forces and trends advances in information technology such as the internet make information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world this technology facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets issuers and investors are also more readily able to obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell many of which may be unfamiliar to them this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and development of worldwide financial markets and a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk as a result existing capital markets have expanded and a number of new capital markets have emerged in addition more issuers and investors are accessing developed capital markets 

another trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets recent credit market disruptions have slowed the trend of disintermediation globally but moody’s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems thus disintermediation is expected to expand in the longerterm 

the strong growth trend seen in the issuance of structured finance securities reversed dramatically in 2008 due to the market turmoil the market disruptions that escalated in 2008 are expected to continue in the immediate term and moody’s expects to see a continued decline in revenue from this market in 2009 however although the extent and scale are unclear moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global credit markets and provide opportunities for longer term growth moody’s will continue to monitor and support the progress of this market and adapt to meet the changing needs 

rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of mis therefore a substantial portion of mis’s revenue is dependent upon the volume and number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets that it rates moody’s is therefore affected by for example the performance and the prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request mis ratings to aid investors in their investment decision process however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings subscriptionbased research and other areas are less dependent on or independent of the volume or number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets 

moody’s operations are also subject to various risks inherent in carrying on business internationally such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources however the formation of for example a new governmentsponsored regional or global rating agency would pose a risk to moody’s growth prospects management believes that this risk compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry is relatively low because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required with uncertainty about the likelihood of financial success 

legislative bodies and regulators in both the us europe and selective other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of cras which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of mis or increased costs of doing business for moody’s therefore in order to broaden the potential for expansion of nonratings services moody’s reorganized in january 2008 into two distinct businesses mis consisting solely of the ratings business and ma moody’s analytics conducts all nonratings activities and includes the mkmv and fermat businesses the sale of credit research produced by mis and the production and sale of other credit related products and services the reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by ma into activities which were previously restricted due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities see “regulation” below 

  

   

ma expects to benefit from the growing demand among credit market participants for information that enables them to make sound investment and risk management decisions these customers require advanced qualitative and quantitative tools to support their management of increasingly complex capital market instruments such complexity creates analytical challenges for market participants including financial intermediaries asset managers and other investors in recent years reliable thirdparty ratings and research served to supplement or substitute for traditional inhouse research as the scale geographic scope and complexity of financial markets grew recent disruptions in credit markets threaten to slow this trend but moody’s expects to sustain reliance on its offerings as enhancements to credit rating methodologies and other changes in securities origination processes restore investor confidence and more orderly market operations 

growth in ma is also expected as financial institutions adopt active credit portfolio management practices and implement internal credit assessment tools for compliance with basel ii regulations ma offers products that respond to these needs this growth will be realized by for example the development of new private firm default probability models for specific countries and by expanding analysis capabilities of new asset classes 

competition 

the mis business competes with other credit rating agencies and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research many of moody’s customers also have inhouse credit research capabilities moody’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp’s in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp moody’s competitors include fitch a subsidiary of fimalac sa dominion bond rating service ltd of canada “dbrs” am best company inc japan credit rating agency ltd rating and investment information inc of japan ri and eganjones ratings company in 2008 two more firms were granted the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations status lace financial corp in february and realpoint llc in june one or more additional rating agencies may emerge in the us as the sec continues to expand the number of nrsros competition may also increase in developed or developing markets outside the us over the next few years as the number of rating agencies increases 

the increased regulatory focus on credit risk presents both opportunities and challenges for moody’s global demand for credit ratings and risk management services may rise but regulatory actions may result in a greater number of rating agencies andor additional regulation of moody’s and its competitors alternatively banking or securities market regulators could seek to reduce the use of ratings in regulations thereby reducing certain elements of demand for ratings or otherwise seek to control the analysis or business of rating agencies 

credit rating agencies such as mis also compete with other means of managing credit risk such as credit insurance competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk also may pose a competitive threat to moody’s 

ma competes broadly in the financial information space against diversified competitors such as thomsonreuters bloomberg riskmetrics sp fitch dun  bradstreet and markit group among others ma’ main competitors within credit risk management include fitch algorithmics sungard sas iflex and riskmetrics group as well as a host of smaller vendors and inhouse solutions in economic analysis data and modeling services ma faces competition from ihs global insight oxford economics haver analytics and a number of smaller firms around the world within credit services moody’s competes with mercer oliver wyman for certain credit risk consulting with omega performance dc gardner and a host of boutique providers for financial training and creditsights gimme credit and other smaller providers for independent credit research in securities analytics and valuation moody’s competes against interactive data corporation thomsonreuters sp fitch markit group cme intex and many other smaller providers 

moody’s strategy 

moody’s continues to follow growth strategies that adapt to market conditions and capitalize on emerging opportunities 

given recent market turmoil moody’s immediate focus is on making effective business decisions to adjust for the expected reduction in revenue while positioning the company to benefit from an eventual recovery in global credit market activity 

in a world of renewed attention to risk analysis and risk management moody’s is committed to further encouraging the informed use of credit ratings research and related analytics products 

  

   

moody’s seeks to differentiate itself from incumbent and potential competitors with uniquely thoughtful forwardlooking and accurate opinions about credit and the credit industry 

adapting to market change is a key factor in maintaining market relevance moody’s continuously monitors opportunities to selectively diversify its revenue base through organic growth and acquisitions in order to replace lost revenue and position moody’s for new sources of business 

in support of those goals moody’s intends to continue its focus in the following areas 

expansion in financial centers 

moody’s serves its customers through its global network of offices and business affiliations moody’s currently maintains comprehensive rating and marketing operations in financial centers including dubai frankfurt hong kong london madrid milan moscow new york paris singapore sydney and tokyo moody’s expects that its global network will position it to benefit from the expansion of worldwide capital markets and thereby increase revenue moody’s also expects that the growth of its mis business as a consequence of financial market integration in europe will return additionally moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures this will allow moody’s to extend its credit opinion franchise to local and regional obligors through domestic currency ratings and national scale ratings 

new rating products 

moody’s continues to respond to investor demand for new products and enhancements in the recent market turmoil attention to core strengths has been crucial and enhancements have and continue to be focused on quality and transparency given the particular disruption in the structured finance markets mis has been developing enhanced structured finance offerings to meet investor demands for more information content leveraging the diversity of its research data and analytics moody’s has introduced crosssector analysis to better illustrate the broader impacts of recent market events this is further enhanced by the incorporation of macroeconomics to frame conditions and assumptions mis continues to capitalize on market developments and enhance ratings surveillance efficiency focusing on new ratings products such as hedge fund operations quality ratings and to identify design develop and maintain valueadded research analytics and data products serving the capital markets 

internetenhanced products and services 

moody’s is expanding its use of the internet and other electronic media to enhance client service moody’s website provides the public with instant access to ratings and provides the public and subscribers with credit research internet delivery also enables moody’s to provide services to more individuals within a client organization than were available with paperbased products and to offer highervalue services because of more timely delivery moody’s expects that access to these applications will increase client use of moody’s services moody’s expects to continue to invest in electronic media to capitalize on these and other opportunities 

expansion of credit research products and investment analytic tools 

moody’s plans to expand its research and analytic services through internal development and through acquisitions most new product initiatives tend to be more analytical and dataintensive than traditional narrative research offerings such services address investor interest in replicating the monitoring activities conducted by for example moody’s securitization analysts and provide the means for customers to gain access to raw data and adjusted financial statistics and ratios used by moody’s analysts in the rating process for municipalities companies and financial institutions these products represent important sources of growth for the research business ma is developing products in the fixedincome valuations and pricing arena that facilitate price transparency in global fixed income markets especially for complex structured securities and derivative instruments moreover moody’s continues to explore opportunities to extend its research relevance in new domestic or regional markets eg china as well as new functional markets eg hedge funds 

new quantitative credit risk assessment services 

moody’s will continue to provide banks and other institutions with quantitative credit risk assessment services moody’s believes that there will be increased demand for such services because they assist customers trading or holding creditsensitive assets to better manage risk and deliver better performance also international bank regulatory authorities are assessing the 

  

   

adequacy of banks’ internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining regulatory capital the acquisition of fermat accelerates moody’s developments in this area such regulatory initiatives create demand for and encourage adoption of related services by banks from thirdparty providers 

regulation 

in the us since 1975 mis has been designated as an nrsro by the sec the sec first applied the nrsro designation in that year to companies whose credit ratings could be used by brokerdealers for purposes of determining their net capital requirements since that time congress the sec and other governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of nrsros to distinguish between among other things “investmentgrade” and “noninvestmentgrade” securities 

in september 2006 the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 was passed which created a voluntary registration process for rating agencies wishing to be designated as nrsros the reform act provides the sec with authority to oversee nrsros while prohibiting the sec from regulating the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any nrsro determines credit ratings in june 2007 the sec published its first set of rules under the reform act these rules address the nrsro application and registration process as well as oversight rules related to recordkeeping financial reporting prevention of misuse of material nonpublic information conflicts of interest and prohibited acts and practices in june 2007 mis filed its application for registration as an nrsro with the sec in september 2007 the sec registered mis as an nrsro under the securities exchange act of 1934 and as of that time mis has been subject to the sec’s oversight rules described above as required by the rules mis has made its form nrsro initial application its annual certification of form nrsro and any associated updates publicly available by posting it on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

in july 2008 the sec released a report on its examination of cras the sec began its review of the ratings processes and procedures of the three leading rating agencies — mis sp and fitch — in august 2007 focusing on subprime rmbs and cdos while the commission’s staff noted that most of the period under review predated the implementation of sec rules for the industry the report identified areas that were either of concern to the sec or that the sec believed could be enhanced goingforward the concerns identified by the commission’s staff generally fall into three categories policies addressing potential conflicts of interest resources and resource allocation documentation around policies and procedures and enhancing transparency the sec also summarized the various steps that are already being put in place by the rating agencies as well as those that are under consideration in the sec’s current rulemaking process 

in february 2009 the sec published a second set of final rules applicable to nrsros as well as additional proposed rules these final rules and rule proposals were approved by the commission in early december 2008 the majority of the final rules address managing conflicts of interest enhancing record keeping requirements and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies the deadline for market comment on the new proposed rules is march 26 2009 mis will submit comments to the sec by this deadline 

finally both chambers of the congress are reviewing the broader us regulatory infrastructure and as part of this review the role and function of cras will continue to be studied for example as part of a series of hearings focusing on the existing market turmoil on october 22 2008 the house committee on oversight and government reform held a hearing on the role of credit rating agencies mis has participated in this and other hearings and the written testimonies can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

internationally several regulatory developments have occurred 

the group of 7 and the group of 20 — the g7 finance ministers and central bank governors formally asked the fsf to analyze the underlying causes of the recent financial market turbulence one area for analysis was the role and use of credit rating in the structured finance market to encourage the adoption of a unified regulatory approach the fsf has coordinated the work of other international organizations on these subjects the fsf’s recommendations on the cra industry are as follows improve the quality of the rating process and management of conflicts of interest in rating structured finance securities differentiate ratings on structured finance products from those on corporate and government bonds and expand the initial and ongoing information provided on the risk characteristics of structured products and enhance their review of the quality of the data input and due diligence performed on underlying assets by originators arrangers and issuers 

in november 2008 the heads of state of the g20 reached agreement on a wideranging set of proposals to better regulate financial systems among other things the g20 committed to implement oversight of the cras consistent with the strength 

  

   

ened international code of conduct see below and agreed that in the medium term the countries should implement a registration system for cras the g20 also committed to formulate their regulations and other measures in a consistent manner and recommended that the international organization of securities regulators should review cras’ adoption of the standards and mechanisms for monitoring compliance 

iosco — in december 2004 the technical committee of iosco published its code of conduct fundamentals for credit rating agencies in march 2008 iosco published for public consultation a report on the role of cras in structured finance as well as a proposal to amend the iosco code of conduct fundamentals for cras working with four other globally active cras mis submitted a joint response to iosco’s consultation report this joint response can be found on the regulatory affairs webpage of the company’s website in may 2008 iosco finalized its report and published the revised iosco code at its annual meeting in may 2008 the changes made to the iosco code broadly address greater transparency of methodologies and processes by cras on july 2008 iosco also announced that it will monitor the cras implementation of the iosco code changes and it will explore the means by which iosco members might work together to verify the proper and complete disclosure by cras of information required by the iosco code finally in september iosco announced that it would discuss at its next technical committee meeting held in january 2009 measures that would aim to bring about more globally consistent oversight of cras 

mis initially published its code of professional conduct pursuant to the iosco code in june 2005 and published an updated version in october 2007 in november 2008 mis revised its code to reflect the changes made to the iosco code beginning in 2006 mis has annually published a report that describes its implementation of the code the mis code and the three annual reports that have been published thus far can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

eu — the european commission presently is reexamining the regulatory framework for rating agencies in europe on july 31 2008 the commission published a consultation document seeking comments on proposals with respect to regulating rating agencies that operate in the eu specifically the commission sought comments on the authorization supervision and enforcement rules for rating agencies that operate within the eu over 90 respondents provided the commission with their views on the suggested framework mis’s comments on the proposal are posted on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

in november 2008 the commission introduced proposed regulation for the oversight of cras “proposed regulation” the document is primarily based on the iosco code but with important differences particularly the commission has introduced additional conduct and governance regulation the proposed regulation is now being considered by eu member states — under the leadership of the presidency of the council of the eu — and by the european parliament both bodies have the ability to introduce significant modifications to the commission’s original proposed text 

it is as yet too early to assess the form and content of this reevaluation process 

the basel committee — in june 2004 the basel committee on banking supervision published a new bank capital adequacy framework called basel ii to replace its initial 1988 framework under basel ii ratings assigned by recognized cras or ecais can be used by banks in determining credit risk weights for many of their institutional credit exposures recognized ecais could be subject to a broader range of oversight national authorities have begun the ecai recognition process mis has been recognized as an ecai in several jurisdictions and the recognition process is ongoing in many others mis does not currently believe that basel ii will materially affect its financial position or results of operations as a result of the recent regulatory activity the banking authorities of the basel committee are reconsidering the overall basel ii framework it is as yet too early to assess the form and content of this reevaluation 

other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future in addition in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which mis operates the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of mis cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

 the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occur moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets 

approximately 49 of mis’ revenue for 2008 was transactionbased compared to 68 of mis’ revenue in 2007 revenue from rating transactions in turn is dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets accordingly any conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings 

a significant disruption in world financial markets particularly in the credit markets that began in mid2007 worsened materially in the second half of 2008 particularly in the latter portion of the year when many credit markets experienced a severe lack of liquidity these credit market disruptions together with the current economic slowdown have negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings consequently the company has experienced a substantial reduction in the demand for rating newly issued debt securities resulting in a 32 decrease in mis revenue for 2008 compared to 2007 the timing and nature of any recovery in the credit and other financial markets remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the future or that financial results will not continue to be adversely affected a sustained period of market decline or weakness especially if it relates to credit sensitive securities for which there is typically a high level of demand for ratings could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business and financial results initiatives that the company has undertaken to reduce costs may not be sufficient to offset the results of a prolonged or more severe downturn and further cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the near term due in part to rent technology and other fixed costs associated with some of the company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings further the costreduction initiatives undertaken to date could result in strains in the company’s operations if the credit markets and demand for ratings return to levels that prevailed prior to mid2007 or otherwise unexpectedly surge 

other factors that could further reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities include increases in interest rates or credit spreads continued volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment significant regulatory political or economic events the use of alternative sources of credit including financial institutions and government sources defaults of significant issuers and other unfavorable market and economic conditions 

regulation as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization and potential for new domestic and overseas legislation and regulations 

credit rating agencies are regulated in both the us and in other countries including by state and local authorities currently moody’s is designated as an nrsro pursuant to sec regulation enacted in response to the adoption of the reform act one of the central promises of the reform act was to encourage competition among rating agencies given its adoption moody’s is unable to assess the future impact of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec’s regulations or the impact on moody’s competitive position or its current practices possible consequences of these new regulations include issues that may affect all entities engaged in the rating agency business such as expected increased costs or issues that may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner any of these changes could negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or the markets for its products and services in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict 

in addition over the past year both the g7 and the g20 finance ministers and central bank governors have sought to analyze and arrive at a consistent approach for addressing the various areas of the financial market and have made a variety of recommendations as to regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings finance ministers have also agreed to register rating agencies in their home jurisdiction as a result of the internationally coordinated activity individual countries likely will begin implementing registration regimes for the oversight of cras in the coming years in particular the european commission presently is reexamining the regulatory framework for rating agencies in europe in november 2008 the 

  

   

commission published a draft regulation for the oversight of regulating rating agencies that operate in the eu it is as yet too early to assess the form and content of this reevaluation as with the recent regulatory initiatives in the us these initiatives may affect all entities engaged in the rating agency business or may affect moody’s in a disproportionate manner and could negatively impact moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or the markets for its products and services in ways that moody’s presently is unable to predict 

in addition to the foregoing many legislative and regulatory agencies both in the us and in other countries have been studying or pursuing new laws and regulations addressing cras and the use of credit ratings it is possible that such initiatives could lead to additional laws or regulations affecting moody’s operations or profitability the company’s ability to compete or the markets for its products and services this could include adopting regulations that require debt securities to be rated establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings which could negatively affect competition among rating agencies the level of demand for ratings or the company’s ability to provide objective assessments of creditworthiness additional regulations could potentially increase the costs associated with the operation of a cra alter the rating agencies’ communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings change the regulatory framework to which cras are subject and affect the competitive environment in which cras operate 

as existing laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and new laws or regulations are adopted the costs of compliance may increase and moody’s may not be able to pass these costs through the pricing of its products in addition increased regulatory uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of laws and regulations may increase costs decrease demand or affect the manner in which moody’s or its customers or users of credit ratings operate or alter the economics of the credit ratings business by restricting or mandating the business models under which an nrsro is permitted to operate 

a description of several of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the us and other countries is described above under the section entitled “regulation” in item 1 “business” of this form 10k 

legal economic and regulatory risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions 

moody’s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant and increasing portion of its revenue from sources outside the us in addition to the regulatory risks discussed above operations in different countries expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into us dollars and currency fluctuations us laws affecting overseas operations including regulations applicable under the office of foreign asset control and the foreign corrupt practices act domestic and foreign export and import restrictions tariffs and other trade barriers political and economic instability the possibility of nationalization expropriation price controls and other restrictive governmental actions longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables and potentially adverse tax consequences 

in addition to competition from other rating agencies that operate in a number of international jurisdictions and specialized companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company inc with respect to the insurance industry in many foreign countries moody’s will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence and greater familiarity or a longer operating history in those markets these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions that moody’s does not receive putting moody’s at a competitive disadvantage 

uncertain impact of government actions to stabilize financial institutions and markets 

the us government announced several programs in 2008 including the emergency economic stabilization act the october 14 2008 joint statement by the us treasury federal reserve and fdic announcing the troubled asset relief program through which the government is authorized to purchase up to 700 billion in whole loans and mortgagerelated securities as well as to invest directly in financial institutions the treasury department’s money market mutual fund guaranty program the federal reserve’s commercial paper funding facility and payment of interest on reserve balances the fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program and the february 10 2009 statement by the us treasury additionally the governments of many nations and international organizations such as the international monetary fund have announced similar measures for institutions and countries around the world there is no assurance that these programs individually or collectively will have beneficial effects in the credit markets will address credit or liquidity issues of companies that participate in the programs will reduce volatility or uncertainty in the financial markets or will reverse or moderate the slowdown and downturn of world economies the failure of these programs to have their intended effects could have a material adverse effect on the financial markets which in turn could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations in addition these and 

  

   

similar initiatives could reduce the demand for ratings of credit securities or other financial products could result in increased government regulation of such markets and could have other unanticipated adverse effects on the markets for and demand for debt securities andor for ratings of such instruments 

increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service at the same time bankruptcies and consolidation of customers particularly those involved in structured finance products and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of customers while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and service if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors moody’s may lose market share 

introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies 

the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are highly competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and to utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s or may price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by the company customers or others may develop alternative proprietary systems for assessing credit risk such developments could affect demand for moody’s products and the company’s growth prospects in addition moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by limitations of its information technologies that fail to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors 

exposure to litigation related to moody’s rating opinions 

currently moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities as part of ongoing investigations and is cooperating with those inquiries in addition moody’s faces litigation from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions as well as other related actions in these difficult economic times when the value of creditdependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased the number of investigations and legal proceedings moody’s is facing has increased these proceedings impose additional expenses on the company which may increase over time as these matters progress procedurally require the attention of senior management to an extent that may reduce their ability to devote significant time addressing other business issues and may result in fines or damages if we are deemed to have violated any laws or regulations as moody’s international business expands these types of claims may increase or become more costly because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as provided by the first amendment and may pose criminal rather than civil penalties for noncompliance these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and we may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover them and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time 

exposure to reputational and credibility concerns 

moody’s reputation is one of the key bases on which the company competes to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or that moody’s relative to its competitors suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be adversely affected factors that could affect credibility include potentially the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities by a particular rating agency the timing and nature of changes in ratings adverse publicity as to the ratings process and the appearance of a conflict of interest 

possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures 

moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries investment banks investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by offering higher compensation than moody’s or providing more favorable working conditions moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis moody’s may also lose key employees due to other factors such as catastrophes that could lead to disruption of business operations moody’s ability to compete effectively will continue to depend among other things on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees 

  

   

moody’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

moody’s ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody’s is located this may include a disruption involving electrical communications or other services used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody’s conducts business whether due to human error natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage computer viruses intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism or war or otherwise moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of major operating systems may not be successful the company does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations its ability to service and interact with moody’s clients and customers may suffer 

the company’s operations also rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks although moody’s takes protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant its computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses or other malicious events that could have a security impact if one or more of such events occur this could jeopardize moody’s or its clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through its computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s its clients’ its counterparties’ or third parties’ operations moody’s may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures and the company may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by moody’s

for claims litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate in other instances because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of fin 48 implemented as of january 1 2007 which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

based on its review of the latest information available and subject to the contingencies described in item 7 “mda – contingencies” the ultimate monetary liability of the company for the pending matters referred to above other than legacy tax matters that are discussed in part ii item 7 “mda – contingencies “ is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition although it is possible that the effect could be material to the company’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period this opinion is subject to the contingencies described in part ii item 7 “mda — contingencies”

performance graph 

the following graph compares the total cumulative shareholder return of the company to the performance of standard  poor’s stock 500 index an index of performance peer group companies the “performance peer group” and the russell 3000 financial services index 

the company is electing to use the russell 3000 financial services index which is accessible to our shareholders in newspapers the internet and other readily available sources for purposes of the following graph the company previously utilized the performance peer group which is a custom composite index of peer issuers that were selected in good faith at december 31 2008 this performance peer group consisted of the mcgrawhill companies pearson plc thomsonreuters corporation and wolters kluwer nv late in 2007 dow jones  company inc was acquired by news corporation and in 2008 reuters group plc was acquired by thomson corporation as a result of these changes and because of the limited number of companies contained in the performance peer group index the company believes that the index previously utilized is not as representative for comparison purposes as the russell 3000 financial services index 

the comparison assumes that 10000 was invested in the company’s common stock and in each of the foregoing indices on december 31 2003 the comparison also assumes the reinvestment of dividends if any the total return for the common stock was 31 during the performance period as compared with a total return during the same period of 10 for the sp 500 48 for the russell 3000 financial services index and 19 for the performance peer group

the company 

moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings and related research data and analytical tools ii quantitative credit risk measures risk scoring software and credit portfolio management solutions and iii software for fixed income pricing data and valuation models moody’s operates in two reportable segments mis and ma 

mis the credit rating agency publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors 

the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets these offerings include quantitative credit risk scores credit processing software economic research analytical models financial data securities pricing and valuation services and specialized consulting services ma also distributes investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its rating process including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies and commentary on topical credit related events 

beginning in january 2008 moody’s segments were changed to reflect the reorganization announced in august 2007 as a result of the reorganization the rating agency is reported in the mis segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned all of moody’s other nonrating commercial activities including mkmv and sales of research produced by mis analysts and the production and sales of other products and services are represented in the ma segment 

as part of the reorganization there were several realignments within the mis lobs sovereign and subsovereign ratings which were previously part of financial institutions infrastructureutilities ratings which were previously part of corporate finance and project finance which was previously part of structured finance were combined with the public finance business to form a new lob called public project and infrastructure finance in addition real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business furthermore in august 2008 the global managed investments ratings group previously part of the structured finance business was combined with the financial institutions business 

within ma various aspects of the legacy mis research business and mkmv business were combined to form the subscriptions software and consulting businesses the subscriptions business includes credit and economic research data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis the software business includes license and maintenance fees for credit risk securities pricing and valuation software products and the consulting business includes professional services and credit training associated with risk modeling credit scorecard development and other specialized analytical projects as well as credit education services that are typically sold on a perengagement basis subscription services are typically sold for an initial 12month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods 

the following is a discussion of the results of operations of these segments excluding the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content data and products developed by mis additionally overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company are allocated to each segment based on a revenuesplit methodology overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy information technology and support staff such as finance human resource information technology and legal 

in addition to its reported results moody’s has included in this mda certain adjusted results that the sec defines as “nongaap financial measures” management believes that such nongaap financial measures when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the company’s performance these nongaap financial measures relate to legacy tax matters and adjustments made to the company’s 2007 restructuring plan further described in note 17 and note 10 respectively to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

   

certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets pension and other postretirement benefits and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

revenue recognition 

in recognizing revenue related to ratings mis uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between the initial assignment of ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where mis does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods in such cases mis defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods 

the portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers the monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities currently the estimated monitoring periods range from one to ten years at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 deferred revenue included approximately 48 million 54 million and 47 million respectively related to such monitoring fees 

additionally in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities derivatives international residential mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods ranging from three to 51 years which are based on the expected lives of the rated securities at december 31 2008 at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately 82 million 86 million and 72 million respectively 

mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 accounts receivable included approximately 34 million 38 million and 34 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 

revenue earned within the ma segment relating to the three lines of business are recognized as follows subscriptionbased revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period which is typically for an initial 12month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods beginning upon delivery of the initial product software revenue is recognized at time of delivery which is considered to have occurred upon transfer of the product master or first copy if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs consulting revenue is generally recognized at the time services are performed 

certain revenue arrangements within the ma segment include multiple elements such as software licenses maintenance subscription fees and professional services in these types of arrangements the fee is allocated to the various products or services based on objective measurements of fair value that is generally the price charged when sold separately — or vendorspecific objective evidence 

  

   

accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue based on historical experience and current conditions such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance billing adjustments and uncollectible account writeoffs are recorded against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in amounts that are greater or less than estimates in each of 2008 2007 and 2006 the company revised its provision rates for billing adjustments and uncollectible accounts to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate accounts receivable allowance 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in the “contingencies” section of this “mda” commencing on page 51 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities based on its review of the latest information available and subject to the contingencies described in item 7 “mda — contingencies” the ultimate monetary liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on moody’s future reported results and financial position 

for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the provision for income taxes reflected credits of 87 million 273 million and 24 million respectively due to changes in the company’s liabilities for legacy tax exposures that were assumed by moody’s in connection with its separation from old db in october 2000 these tax matters are more fully described under the caption “legacy tax matters” within item 7 “mda” 

goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment annually as of november 30 th or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” these impairment indicators could include significant events or circumstances that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit as of the 2008 impairment test the reporting units were determined to be mis ma and fermat to test goodwill for impairment the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill and if the fair value exceeds its carrying value then goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill if the implied fair value exceeds the carrying value then goodwill is not impaired otherwise an impairment loss will be recorded by the amount the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value the company allocates corporate items to the carrying value of the reporting unit based on the same methodology as corporate and overhead expenses are allocated the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values discount rates determination of moody’s weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit and an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which charge could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations moody’s allocates goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis 

  

   

in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

restructuring 

the company has engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs contract termination costs and asset impairments if the actual amounts differ from these estimates the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted for a full description of moody’s restructuring actions refer to the “results of operations” section below and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the expenses assets and liabilities that moody’s reports for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

 the discount rate selected to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligations as of december 31 2008 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares the plans’ projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows are then discounted back to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s postretirement plans 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise to the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants for moody’s postretirement plans the total losses as of december 31 2008 that have not been recognized in annual expense are 271 million and moody’s expects to recognize in net periodic pension expense 08 million for the amortization of actuarial losses 

for moody’s funded pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under sfas no 87 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the marketrelated value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2008 the company has an unrecognized asset loss of 326 million of which 76 million will be recognized in the marketrelated value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2010 expense 

  

   

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2009 operating income these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2009 expenses assets and liabilities related to moody’s postretirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  

 a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2009 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to postretirement plans will be 152 million in 2009 compared with 142 million in 2008 excluding the costs of curtailment and special termination benefits of 38 million in 2008 the expected expense increase in 2009 reflects the effects of lower discount rates higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher loss on plan assets 

stockbased compensation 

the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payments” under this pronouncement companies are required to record compensation expense for all sharebased payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans stock options restricted stock and stock appreciation rights the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company which is limited the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 

an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2008 dollars in millions 

 

 income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 109 therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

moody’s is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of its fin 48 tax liabilities on january 1 2007 upon the implementation of fin 48 the company implemented the accounting policy to classify interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and to classify associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses prior to the implementation of fin 48 the company had classified interest related to income taxes and associated penalties as components of income tax expense in accordance with fin 48 prior period financial statements have not been reclassified for this change 

  

   

fin 48 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority upon the initial implementation of fin 48 the company recorded a reduction of its january 1 2007 retained earnings of 433 million which is comprised of 329 million of tax and accrued interest of 173 million 104 million net of tax as the determination of fin 48 liabilities and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial condition 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated dividend distributions from nonus subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s 

operating segments 

beginning in january 2008 moody’s segments were changed to reflect the reorganization announced in august 2007 as a result of the reorganization the rating agency is reported in the mis segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned all of moody’s other nonrating commercial activities including mkmv and sales of research produced by mis analysts and the production and sales of other products and services are represented in the ma segment 

as part of the reorganization there were several realignments within the mis lobs sovereign and subsovereign ratings which were previously part of financial institutions infrastructureutilities ratings which were previously part of corporate finance and project finance which was previously part of structured finance were combined with the public finance business to form a new lob called public project and infrastructure finance in addition real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business furthermore in august 2008 the global managed investments ratings group previously part of the structured finance business was combined with the financial institutions business 

within ma various aspects of the legacy mis research business and mkmv business were combined to form the subscriptions software and consulting businesses the subscriptions business includes credit and economic research data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis the software business includes license and maintenance fees for credit risk securities pricing and valuation software products and the consulting business includes professional services and credit training associated with risk modeling credit scorecard development and other specialized analytical projects as well as credit education services that are typically sold on a perengagement basis subscription services are typically sold for an initial 12month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods 

the following is a discussion of the results of operations of the new segments excluding the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content data and products developed by mis additionally overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company all of which were previously included in the former mis segment are allocated to each new segment based on a revenuesplit methodology overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy information technology and support staff such as finance human resource information technology and legal

market risk 

moody’s maintains operations in 30 countries outside the us in 2008 approximately 42 and 47 of the company’s revenue billed and expenses incurred respectively were in currencies other than the us dollar principally in the gbp and the euro as such the company is exposed to market risk from changes in fx rates 

as of december 31 2008 approximately 34 of moody’s assets were located outside the united states moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents of 2459 million at december 31 2008 consisted of approximately 152 million which was located outside the us making the company susceptible to fluctuations in fx rates additionally all of moody’s aggregate shortterm investments of 71 million were located outside the united states the effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar on assets and liabilities of nonus operations with nonus functional currencies are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment account in the statement of shareholders’ equity deficit 

moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in highquality investmentgrade securities within and outside the us with maturities of three months or less when purchased the company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of highgrade commercial paper shortterm investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit and high quality investmentgrade corporate bonds in korea the company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and shortterm investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer 

  

   

a portion of the company’s future billings and related revenue is exposed to market risk associated with changes in fx rates primarily related to the euro and gbp under the company’s current fx hedging program the company hedges a portion of fx currency risk for the purpose of reducing volatility in the company’s cash flows related to future euro and gbp billings and related revenue fx options and forwards are currently utilized to hedge these exposures and have maturities between one and 14 months as of december 2008 all fx derivative contracts were set to expire at various times through february 2010 and were deemed to be highly effective under sfas no 133 and related accounting pronouncements no credit losses are anticipated as the counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions the fair value of the company’s outstanding fx derivative contracts was recorded within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and consisted of the following notional amounts 

 

 unrealized gains or losses are recorded in aoci and once realized the gains or losses will be recognized as an adjustment to revenue when the billings are recognized in revenue 

a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the exposure to fluctuations in the fx rates on moody’s fx options a hypothetical 10 favorable change in the overall option currency portfolio would result in a gain of approximately 35 million as of december 31 2008 the maximum loss related to an adverse change in the option currency portfolio would be 31 million 

as a result of the 2008 term loan completed on may 7 2008 the company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 1500 million to protect against fluctuations in the liborbased variable interest rate these swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded into aoci while net interest payments are recorded in the statement of operations at december 31 2008 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was 107 million and is recorded in other liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet the objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing this objective 

a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the exposure to fluctuations in the shortterm libor on moody’s interest expense relating to the 2008 term loan assuming the interest rate swap was not in place a hypothetical change of onepercent in the libor would result in an impact on annual interest expense of approximately 15 million

as a result of recent events in the us subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly various legislative regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are investigating or evaluating the role of rating agencies in the us subprime mortgagebacked securitization market and structured finance markets more generally moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other governmental authorities and is cooperating with such investigations and inquiries moody’s is also cooperating with a review by the sec relating to errors in the model used by mis to rate certain constantproportion debt obligations in addition the company is facing market participant litigation relating to the performance of mis rated securities although moody’s in the normal course experiences such litigation the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased in the current economic environment 

on june 27 2008 the brockton contributory retirement system a purported shareholder of the company’s securities filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the company against its directors and certain senior officers and the company as nominal defendant in the supreme court of the state of new york county of new york the plaintiff asserts various causes of action relating to the named defendants’ oversight of mis’s ratings of rmbs and constantproportion debt obligations and their participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading information about mis’s ratings practices andor a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing the plaintiff seeks compensatory damages restitution disgorgement of profits and other equitable relief on july 2 2008 thomas r flynn a purported shareholder of the company’s securities filed a similar purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the company against its directors and certain senior officers and the company as nominal defendant in the supreme court of the state of new york county of new york asserting similar claims and seeking the same relief the cases have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in november 2008 the company removed the consolidated action to the united states district court for the southern district of new york in december 2008 in january 2009 the plaintiffs moved to remand the case to the supreme court of the state of new york the company will oppose remand and expects to move to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint upon resolution of the remand motion on october 30 2008 the louisiana municipal police employees retirement system a purported shareholder of the company’s securities also filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the company against its directors and certain officers and the company as a nominal defendant in the us district court for the southern district of new york this complaint too asserts various causes of action relating to the company’s ratings of rmbs cdo and constantproportion debt obligations and named defendants’ participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading information about mis’s ratings practices andor a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing on december 9 2008 rena nadoff a purported shareholder of the company filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the company against its directors and its ceo and the company as a nominal defendant in the supreme court of the state of new york the complaint asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with alleged overrating of assetbacked securities and underrating of municipal securities 

two purported class action complaints have been filed by purported purchasers of the company’s securities against the company and certain of its senior officers asserting claims under the federal securities laws the first was filed by raphael nach in the us district court for the northern district of illinois on july 19 2007 the second was filed by teamsters local 282 pension trust fund in the us district court for the southern district of new york on september 26 2007 both actions have been consolidated 

  

   

into a single proceeding entitled in re moody’s corporation securities litigation in the us district court for the southern district of new york on june 27 2008 a consolidated amended complaint was filed purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the company’s securities during the period february 3 2006 through october 24 2007 plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false andor misleading statements concerning the company’s business conduct business prospects business conditions and financial results relating primarily to mis’s ratings of structured finance products including rmbs cdo and constantproportion debt obligations the plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case the company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in september 2008 on february 23 2009 the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims sustaining others and granting plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint by march 18 2009 

for claims litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate in other instances because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of fin 48 implemented as of january 1 2007 which requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

the company cannot predict the ultimate impact that any of the legislative regulatory enforcement or litigation matters may have on how its business is conducted and thus its competitive position financial position or results of operations based on its review of the latest information available in the opinion of management the ultimate monetary liability of the company for the pending matters referred to above other than the legacy tax matters that are discussed below is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position although it is possible that the effect could be material to the company’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period 

legacy tax matters 

moody’s continues to have exposure to certain legacy tax matters the following description of the relationships among moody’s new db and their predecessor entities is important in understanding the legacy tax matters 

in november 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation separated into three separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation acnielsen corporation and cognizant corporation in june 1998 the dun  bradstreet corporation separated into two separate public companies old db and rh donnelley corporation during 1998 cognizant separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated and nielsen media research inc in september 2000 old db separated into two separate public companies new db and moody’s as further described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

old db and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities old db and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable irs determinations on certain tax matters and certain other potential tax liabilities all as described in such agreements further in connection with the 2000 distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement new db and moody’s have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to legacy tax matters 

settlement agreements were executed with the irs in 2005 regarding legacy tax matters for the years 19891990 and 19931996 as of december 31 2008 the company continues to carry a liability of 18 million with respect to these matters with respect to these settlement agreements moody’s and new db believe that ims health and nmr did not pay their full share of the liability to the irs pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements among the parties moody’s and new db paid these amounts to the irs on their behalf and attempted to resolve this dispute with ims health and nmr as a result moody’s and new db commenced arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr in connection with the 19891990 matter this matter was resolved during the third quarter of 2008 in favor of moody’s and new db resulting in ims health and nmr having paid a total of 67 million to moody’s moody’s and new db may also commence an arbitration proceeding to collect amounts owed by ims health and nmr with respect to the 19931996 matter moody’s cannot predict the outcome of this matter with any certainty 

  

   

amortization expense deductions 

this legacy tax matter which was affected by developments in june 2007 and 2008 as further described below involves a partnership transaction which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of old db since 1997 irs audits of old db’s and new db’s tax returns for the years 1997 through 2002 concluded in june 2007 without any disallowance of the amortization expense deductions or any other adjustments to income related to this partnership transaction these audits resulted in the irs issuing the notices for other tax issues for the 19972000 years aggregating 95 million in tax and penalties plus statutory interest of approximately 6 million which should be apportioned among moody’s new db ims health and nmr pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements moody’s share of this assessment was 66 million including interest net of tax in november 2007 the irs assessed the tax and penalties and used a portion of the deposit discussed below to satisfy the assessment together with interest the company believes it has meritorious grounds to challenge the irs’s actions and is evaluating its alternatives to recover these amounts the absence of any tax deficiencies in the notices for the amortization expense deductions for the years 1997 through 2002 combined with the expiration of the statute of limitations for 1997 through 2002 for issues not assessed resulted in moody’s recording an earnings benefit of 523 million in the second quarter of 2007 this is comprised of two components as follows i a reversal of a tax liability of 273 million related to the period from 1997 through the distribution date reducing the provision for income taxes and ii a reduction of accrued interest expense of 175 million 106 million net of tax and an increase in other nonoperating income of 144 million relating to amounts due to new db in june 2008 the statute of limitations for new db relating to the 2003 tax year expired as a result in the second quarter of 2008 moody’s recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of 23 million 14 million net of tax and an increase in other nonoperating income of 64 million relating to amounts due to new db 

on the distribution date new db paid moody’s 550 million for 50 of certain anticipated future tax benefits of new db through 2012 it is possible that irs audits of new db for tax years after 2003 could result in income adjustments with respect to the amortization expense deductions of this partnership transaction in the event these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by new db or there is an audit adjustment moody’s would be required pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement to repay to new db an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits and its share of any tax liability that new db incurs as of december 31 2008 moody’s liability with respect to this matter totaled 487 million 

in march 2006 new db and moody’s each deposited 398 million with the irs in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years in july 2007 new db and moody’s commenced procedures to recover approximately 57 million of these deposits 246 million for new db and 319 million for moody’s which represents the excess of the original deposits over the total of the deficiencies asserted in the notices as noted above in november 2007 the irs used 79 million of moody’s portion of the deposit to satisfy an assessment and related interest additionally in the first quarter of 2008 the irs returned to moody’s 331 million in connection with this matter which includes 30 million of interest in july 2008 the irs paid moody’s the remaining 18 million balance of the original deposit and in september 2008 the irs paid moody’s 02 million of interest on that balance 

at december 31 2008 moody’s has recorded liabilities for legacy tax matters totaling 515 million this includes liabilities and accrued interest due to new db arising from the 2000 distribution agreement it is possible that the ultimate liability for legacy tax matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the company which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody’s future reported results financial position and cash flows

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global fixedincome markets have grown significantly in terms of outstanding principal amount and types of securities or other obligations despite the recent market disruption and decline in issuance activity for some important classes of securities in the us and internationally moody’s believes that the overall longterm outlook remains favorable for continued secular growth of fixedincome markets worldwide however moody’s expects that in the nearterm growth drivers such as financial innovation and disintermediation will slow as capital market participants adjust to the 

  

recent poor performance of some structured finance asset classes such as us residential mortgagebacked securities and credit derivatives restoring investor confidence in structured products will require enhancements to moody’s rating processes and probably greater transparency from issuers of structured or securitized debt moody’s is developing updated rating methodologies volatility measures and pricing and valuation services to aid the return of investor trust and though it is likely to be a measured process moody’s expects that these initiatives will support continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions 

growth in global fixedincome markets is attributable to a number of forces and trends advances in information technology such as the internet make information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world this technology facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets issuers and investors are also more readily able to obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell many of which may be unfamiliar to them this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and development of worldwide financial markets and a greater need for credible globally comparable opinions about credit risk as a result existing capital markets have expanded and a number of new capital markets have emerged in addition more issuers and investors are accessing developed capital markets 

another trend that is driving growth in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets recent credit market disruptions have slowed the trend of disintermediation in important markets such as the us and europe but moody’s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems thus disintermediation is expected to expand in the longerterm 

growth in issuance of structured finance securities has generally been stronger than growth in straight corporate and financial institutions debt issuance though with recent market turmoil this trend is expected to change at least over the near term and possibly longer with investors preferring simpler more standardized and more transparent securities to more complex financial instruments compared with 2007 moody’s expects a decline in structured finance revenue at least through 2008 and possibly into 2009 and beyond 

rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of moody’s investors service therefore a substantial portion of moody’s revenue is dependent upon the volume and number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets that moody’s rates moody’s is therefore affected by for example the performance and the prospects for growth of the major world economies the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request moody’s ratings to aid investors in their investment decision process however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings subscriptionbased research and other areas are less dependent on or independent of the volume or number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets 

moody’s operations are also subject to various risks inherent in carrying on business internationally such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources however the formation of for example a new governmentsponsored regional or global rating agency would pose a risk to moody’s growth prospects management believes that this risk compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry is relatively low because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required with uncertainty about the likelihood of financial success 

legislative bodies and regulators in both the united states europe and selective other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of credit rating agencies which may result in for example an increased number of competitors changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of moody’s investors service or increased costs of doing business for moody’s therefore in order to broaden the potential for expansion of nonratings services beginning in january 2008 moody’s has reorganized into two distinct businesses moody’s investors service consisting solely of the ratings business and moody’s analytics moody’s analytics now conducts all nonratings activities and includes the mkmv business the sale of credit research produced by moody’s investors service and the production and sale of other credit related products and services the reorganization is expected to broaden the opportunities for expansion by moody’s analytics into activities which were previously restricted due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities see “regulation” below 

moody’s analytics expects to benefit from the growing demand among credit market participants for information that enables them to make sound investment and risk management decisions these customers require advanced qualitative and 

  

quantitative tools to support their management of increasingly complex capital market instruments such complexity creates analytical challenges for market participants including financial intermediaries asset managers and other investors in recent years reliable thirdparty ratings and research served to supplement or substitute for traditional inhouse research as the scale geographic scope and complexity of financial markets grew recent disruptions in credit markets threaten to slow this trend but moody’s expects to sustain reliance on its offerings as enhancements to credit rating methodologies and other changes in securities origination processes restore investor confidence and more orderly market operations 

growth in moody’s analytics is also expected as financial institutions adopt active credit portfolio management practices and implement internal credit assessment tools for compliance with basel ii regulations moody’s analytics offers products that respond to these needs this growth will be realized by for example the development of new private firm default probability models for specific countries and by expanding analysis capabilities of new asset classes 

competition 

the moody’s investors service business competes with other credit rating agencies and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research many of our customers also have inhouse credit research capabilities moody’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp’s in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp moody’s competitors include fitch a subsidiary of fimalac sa dominion bond rating service ltd of canada “dbrs” and am best company inc in 2007 japan credit rating agency ltd rating and investment information inc ri and eganjones also were designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations “nrsro” and in february 2008 lace financial corp also was registered as an nrsro one or more additional rating agencies may emerge in the united states as the securities and exchange commission “sec” continues to expand the number of nrsros competition may also increase in developed or developing markets outside the united states over the next few years as the number of rating agencies increases 

financial regulators are reviewing their approach to supervision and have sought or are seeking comments on changes to the global regulatory framework that could affect moody’s bank regulators under the oversight of the basel committee on banking supervision have proposed using refined risk assessments as the basis for minimum capital requirements the proposed standardized approach relies on rating agency opinions while the proposed internal ratings based approach relies on systems and processes maintained by the regulated bank the increased regulatory focus on credit risk presents both opportunities and challenges for moody’s global demand for credit ratings and risk management services may rise but regulatory actions may result in a greater number of rating agencies andor additional regulation of moody’s and its competitors alternatively banking or securities market regulators could seek to reduce the use of ratings in regulations thereby reducing certain elements of demand for ratings or otherwise seek to control the analysis or business of rating agencies 

credit rating agencies such as moody’s also compete with other means of managing credit risk such as credit insurance competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk also may pose a competitive threat to moody’s 

moody’s analytics’ main competitors for quantitative measures of default risk include the riskmetrics group sp creditsights ri’s financial technology institute fitch algorithmics dun and bradstreet and other smaller vendors as well as models developed internally by customers other firms may compete in the future baker hill acquired by experian and bureau van dijk electronic publishing are moody’s analytics’ main competitors in the market for analytical software supporting commercial lending activities mercer oliver wyman competes with the professional services group at moody’s analytics for certain credit risk consulting services business in economic analysis data and modeling services moody’s analytics faces competition from global insight haver analytics and a number of smaller firms around the world 

moody’s strategy 

moody’s intends to focus on the following opportunities 

expansion in financial centers 

moody’s serves its customers through its global network of offices and business affiliations moody’s currently maintains comprehensive rating and marketing operations in financial centers including frankfurt hong kong london madrid milan moscow new york paris singapore sydney and tokyo moody’s expects that its global network will position it to benefit from the expansion of worldwide capital markets and thereby increase revenue moody’s also expects that the growth of its moody’s investors service business as a consequence of financial market integration in europe will continue additionally moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures this will allow moody’s to extend its credit opinion franchise to local and regional obligors through domestic currency ratings and national scale ratings 

  

new rating products 

moody’s is pursuing numerous initiatives to expand credit ratings including from public fixedincome securities markets to other sectors with credit risk exposures within established capital markets moody’s continues to expand its rating coverage of bank loans and project finance loans and securities in global and local counterparty markets moody’s offers distinct sets of rating products to address the creditworthiness of financial firms including bank financial strength and deposit ratings and insurance financial strength ratings moody’s has also introduced issuer ratings for corporations not active in the debt markets in response to growing investor demand for expanded credit opinion in the high yield market moody’s has introduced a number of new products including joint default analysis corporate financial metrics and both lossgivendefault and probabilityofdefault ratings the recent disruptions in the structured finance markets may provide opportunities to enhance structured finance offerings to meet investor demands for more information content in order to capitalize on market developments and to enhance ratings surveillance efficiency moody’s has created a new products group within moody’s investors service to focus on new ratings products such as hedge fund operations quality ratings and to identify design develop and maintain valueadded research analytics and data products serving the capital markets 

internetenhanced products and services 

moody’s is expanding its use of the internet and other electronic media to enhance client service moody’s website provides the public with instant access to ratings and provides the public and subscribers with credit research internet delivery also enables moody’s to provide services to more individuals within a client organization than were available with paperbased products and to offer highervalue services because of more timely delivery moody’s expects that access to these applications will increase client use of moody’s services moody’s expects to continue to invest in electronic media to capitalize on these and other opportunities 

expansion of credit research products and investment analytic tools 

moody’s plans to expand its research and analytic services through internal development and through acquisitions most new product initiatives tend to be more analytical and dataintensive than traditional narrative research offerings such services address investor interest in replicating the monitoring activities conducted by for example moody’s securitization analysts and provide the means for customers to gain access to raw data and adjusted financial statistics and ratios used by moody’s analysts in the rating process for municipalities companies and financial institutions these products represent important sources of growth for the research business moody’s analytics is developing products in the fixedincome valuations and pricing arena that facilitate price transparency in global fixed income markets especially for complex structured securities and derivative instruments moreover moody’s continues to explore opportunities to extend its research relevance in new domestic or regional markets eg china as well as new functional markets eg hedge funds 

new quantitative credit risk assessment services 

moody’s will continue to provide banks and other institutions with quantitative credit risk assessment services moody’s believes that there will be increased demand for such services because they assist customers trading or holding creditsensitive assets to better manage risk and deliver better performance also international bank regulatory authorities are assessing the adequacy of banks’ internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining regulatory capital such regulatory initiatives create demand for and encourages adoption of related services by banks from thirdparty providers 

regulation 

in the united states since 1975 moody’s investors service “mis” has been designated as an nrsro by the sec the sec first applied the nrsro designation in that year to companies whose credit ratings could be used by brokerdealers for purposes of determining their net capital requirements since that time congress the sec and other governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of nrsros to distinguish between among other things “investment grade” and “noninvestment grade” securities 

in september 2006 the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 “reform act” was passed which created a voluntary registration process for rating agencies wishing to be designated as nrsros the reform act provides the sec with authority to oversee nrsros while prohibiting the sec from regulating the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any nrsro determines credit ratings in june 2007 the sec published final rules to implement 

  

the reform act which address the nrsro application and registration process as well as oversight rules related to recordkeeping financial reporting prevention of misuse of material nonpublic information conflicts of interest and prohibited acts and practices in june 2007 mis submitted to the sec its application for registration as an nrsro and in september 2007 the sec registered mis as an nrsro under the securities exchange act of 1934 consequently mis is now subject to the sec’s oversight rules described above and as required by the rules has made its form nrsro initial application publicly available by posting it on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

internationally several regulatory developments have occurred 

the group of 7 finance minister and central bank authorities g7 —after their october 2007 meeting the g7 published a jointstatement outlining their intended approach to the recent financial turbulence in this statement the finance ministers formally asked the financial stability forum fsf to analyze the underlying causes of the turbulence and to provide an update at the g7’s meetings in late spring 2008 the g7 identified the following four areas on which it would like the fsf to offer proposals liquidity and risk management accounting and valuation of financial derivatives role methodologies and use of credit rating agencies in structured finance and basic supervisory principles of prudential oversight including the treatment of offbalance sheet vehicles the fsf has been working on this request and is expected to provide its recommendations at the g7’s spring 2008 meeting 

iosco — in april 2007 the technical committee of the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” announced that it would reconstitute the task force on rating agencies to undertake a new mandate on the role of credit rating agencies in relation to the development of structured finance products this work is to be carried out in close cooperation with the committee on the global financial system cgfs in november 2007 iosco announced the creation of a new and dedicated task force to review the issues facing securities regulators following the recent events in the global credit markets the topics which will be covered by this task force include risk management  prudential supervision transparency  due diligence valuation of assets  accounting issues and credit rating agencies it is anticipated that the task force will present its final report to the technical committee in may 2008 during iosco’s annual conference in paris 

in december 2004 the technical committee of iosco published its code of conduct fundamentals for credit rating agencies “iosco code” mis initially published its code of professional conduct “mis code” pursuant to the iosco code in june 2005 and published an updated moody’s code in october 2007 in december 2007 mis published its second annual report on the implementation of the moody’s code the two annual reports and the mis code can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

european union —the european commission “commission” stated in january 2006 and again in january 2007 that recent european union “eu” financial services legislative measures that are relevant to credit rating agencies combined with a selfregulatory framework for rating agencies based on the iosco code provided a suitable framework for the oversight of rating agencies and that no legislative actions were required at the time the committee of european securities regulators “cesr” has been charged with monitoring rating agencies’ compliance with the iosco code and reporting back to the commission regularly cesr conducted its first annual review to assess such compliance during 2006 and published its report in january 2007 cesr concluded that four internationally active rating agencies operating in the eu including moody’s are largely compliant with the iosco code and it identified a few areas where it believed rating agencies could improve their processes and disclosures and where the iosco code could be improved cesr began its second annual review in 2007 and is evaluating the areas identified in its 2006 report the impact of the reform act on the ratings business in the european union and the role of rating agencies in the structured finance process including securitizations backed by subprime residential mortgages as part of cesr’s review process cesr has on two occasions requested comments from rating agencies and other market participants the written responses mis submitted to the cesr questionnaires can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website cesr plans to publish its second annual report in mid2008 

the basel committee —in june 2004 the basel committee on banking supervision published a new bank capital adequacy framework “basel ii” to replace its initial 1988 framework under basel ii ratings assigned by recognized credit rating agencies called external credit assessment institutions or “ecais” can be used by banks in determining credit risk weights for many of their institutional credit exposures recognized ecais could be subject to a broader range of oversight national authorities have begun the ecai recognition process moody’s has been recognized as an ecai in several jurisdictions and the recognition process is ongoing in many others moody’s does not currently believe that basel ii will materially affect its financial position or results of operations 

in addition as a result of the recent events in the us subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly various national and global regulatory and other authorities have initiated or indicated that they are considering reviews of the role of rating agencies in the us subprime mortgagebacked securitization market and structured finance more generally moody’s is the subject of a number of such reviews and cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such current or potential future reviews or their ultimate impact on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s 

  

other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services has been considered from time to time by local national and multinational bodies and is likely to be considered in the future in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies in addition governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which moody’s operates in addition the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of moody’s cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occurs moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets 

approximately 79 of moody’s revenue in 2007 was derived from ratings revenues from ratings in turn are dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets accordingly any conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which moody’s provides ratings services and thereby have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings 

factors that could reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities include unfavorable financial or economic conditions in addition increases in interest rates or credit spreads volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment significant regulatory political or economic events defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively affect the general level of debt issuance andor the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers beginning in july 2007 there has been a significant disruption in world financial markets particularly in the credit markets a sustained period of market decline or weakness especially if it relates to credit sensitive securities for which there is typically a high level of demand for ratings could have a material adverse effect on moody’s business and financial results the company has recently noted a substantial reduction in the volume of debt securities issued and related revenues as a result of the uncertainties presently being experienced in the market for collateralized debt and other structured finance obligations revenue earned from ratings in 2007 was approximately 9 higher as compared to 2006 however ratings revenue in the second half of 2007 compared to the second half of 2006 decreased approximately 11 due to the reduced number of creditsensitive securities issued in the latter half of 2007 as a result of the credit turmoil beginning early in the third quarter of 2007 there can be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the near future or that results will not continue to be adversely affected 

to the extent that any concerns affecting credibility are perceived in the marketplace moody’s market share andor revenue could be affected 

moody’s reputation is one key factor on the basis of which it competes moody’s is constantly taking steps to help maintain the absolute trustworthiness of its reputation as well as its credibility in the marketplace accordingly to the extent that rating agency business as a whole or moody’s relative to its competitors suffers a loss in credibility moody’s business could be adversely affected factors that could affect ones credibility include potentially the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities by a particular rating agency as well as the ability to recognize potential changes in ratings on a timely basis 

increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and service if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors moody’s may lose market share 

introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies 

the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are highly competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and to utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s moody’s growth prospects could also be adversely affected by limitations of its information technologies that fail to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors 

  

regulation as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization and potential for new us state and local legislation and regulations 

when governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected governmentmandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness in these circumstances debt issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating which may negatively affect the company 

in the united states and other countries the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and are presently subject to review by a number of legislative or regulatory bodies including the sec in the united states and state and local oversight it is possible that such reviews could lead to greater oversight or regulation concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies such additional regulations could potentially increase the costs associated with the operation of a credit rating agency alter the rating agencies’ communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings change the regulatory framework to which credit rating agencies are subject andor affect the competitive environment in which credit rating agencies operate 

currently moody’s is designated as an nrsro pursuant to sec regulation enacted in response to the adoption of the reform act one of the central promises of the reform act was to encourage competition among rating agencies given its recent adoption moody’s is unable to assess the future impact of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec’s regulations or the impact on moody’s competitive position or its current practices although moody’s would expect the reform act to increase costs of all entities engaged in the rating agency business similarly at present moody’s is unable to predict the regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by any of the various regulatory bodies or the effect that any such changes may have on its business a description of several of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the united states and other countries is described above under the section entitled “regulation” in item 1 “business” of this form 10k 

potential for increased competition and regulation in foreign jurisdictions 

moody’s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant and increasing portion of its revenue from sources outside the us operations in different countries expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into us dollars and currency fluctuations export and import restrictions tariffs and other trade barriers political and economic instability as well as nationalization expropriation price controls and other restrictive governmental actions longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables and potentially adverse tax consequences 

moody’s faces competition from among others sp fitch dbrs local rating agencies in a number of international jurisdictions and specialized companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company inc with respect to the insurance industry since moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the us it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions that moody’s does not receive putting moody’s at a competitive disadvantage 

because moody’s operates globally and plans to expand its international scope it must also react to regulatory changes abroad cesr has monitored rating agencies’ compliance with the iosco code although the cesr recently concluded in a report that the four internationally active rating agencies that operate in the european union including moody’s are largely compliant with the iosco code it did identify a few areas where it believed the rating agencies could improve their processes and disclosures and where the iosco code could be improved cesr indicated that it will look into these areas in particular as well as the impact of the reform act and the sec’s implementing rules on the rating business in the european union moody’s is unable to assess the potential impact of any regulatory changes that may result from the cesr’s review including whether any additional regulation would restrict or otherwise inhibit moody’s expansion into foreign markets see the discussion under the section entitled “regulation” in item 1 “business” of this form 10k for additional information regarding the iosco code and the cesr 

  

exposure to litigation related to moody’s rating opinions 

currently moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities as part of ongoing investigations and is cooperating with those inquiries the outcome of such investigations is presently unknown in addition moody’s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions as well as other related actions as moody’s international business expands these types of claims may increase or become more costly because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the first amendment and criminal rather than civil penalties these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time 

possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures 

moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than moody’s or subject employees to less individual scrutiny moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis moody’s may lose key employees due to other factors such as catastrophes that could lead to disruption of business operations moody’s ability to compete effectively will continue to depend among other things on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees 

our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located this may include a disruption involving electrical communications or other services used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business whether due to human error natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage computer viruses intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism or war or otherwise we do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of these locations and our personnel in those locations are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations our ability to service and interact with our clients and customers from these locations may suffer

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets pension and other postretirement benefits and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

revenue recognition 

in recognizing revenue related to ratings moody’s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods in such cases the company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods 

the portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers the monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities currently the estimated monitoring periods range from one to ten years at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 deferred revenue included approximately 54 million 47 million and 36 million respectively related to such monitoring fees 

additionally in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities derivatives international residential mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods ranging from nine to 46 years which are based on the expected lives of the rated securities at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately 86 million 72 million and 57 million respectively 

moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 accounts receivable included approximately 38 million 34 million and 31 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically the company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 

accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance adjustments to and writeoffs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its reviews moody’s establishes or adjusts allowances as considered appropriate in the circumstance this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in revenue adjustments that are greater or less than moody’s estimates in each of 2007 2006 and 2005 the company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in the “contingencies” section of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” commencing on page 38 is highly subjective 

  

and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate  the company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities based on its review of the latest information available and subject to the contingencies described in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – contingencies” the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on moody’s future reported results and financial position 

for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 the provision for income taxes reflected credits of 273 million 24 million and 88 million respectively due to changes in the company’s liabilities for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by moody’s in connection with its separation from old db in october 2000 these tax matters are more fully described under the caption “legacy contingencies” within item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates in estimating future operating results and cash flows moody’s considers internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates and the effects of external factors and market conditions if actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the company’s judgments or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which charge could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

restructuring charge 

the company has engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs contract termination costs and asset impairments if the actual amounts differ from these estimates the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted for a full description of moody’s restructuring actions refer to the “results of operations” section below and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the expenses assets liabilities and obligations that moody’s reports for pension and other postretirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

 the discount rate selected to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligations as of december 31 2007 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares the plans’ projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows are then discounted back to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s pension and other postretirement benefits 

  

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise to the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” “sfas no 87” the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants for moody’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans the total losses as of december 31 2007 which have not been recognized in annual expense are 190 million and in 2008 moody’s expects amortization of actuarial losses to be immaterial 

for moody’s funded pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under sfas no 87 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets which is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2007 the company has an unrecognized asset gain of 41 million of which 17 million will be recognized in the market related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2009 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2008 operating income dollars in millions these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2008 assets liabilities obligations and expenses related to pension and other postretirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2008 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to pension and postretirement plans will be approximately 13 million in 2008 compared with 162 million in 2007 excluding the costs of curtailment and special termination benefits of 108 million in 2007 the expected expense decrease in 2008 reflects the effects of higher discount rates lower amortization of actuarial losses and reduction in workforce due to restructuring which are partially offset by lower plan asset gains 

stockbased compensation 

on january 1 2006 the company implemented under the modified prospective application method the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” under this pronouncement companies are required to record compensation expense for all sharebased payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans stock options restricted stock and stock appreciation rights previously on january 1 2003 the company implemented on a prospective basis the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company which is limited the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 

an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2007 dollars in millions 

 

   

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” therefore income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 

moody’s is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy and other tax matters the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of its fin no 48 tax liabilities on january 1 2007 upon the implementation of fin no 48 the company implemented the accounting policy to classify interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements and to classify associated penalties if any as part of other nonoperating expenses prior to the implementation of fin no 48 the company had classified interest related to income taxes and associated penalties as components of income tax expense in accordance with fin no 48 prior period financial statements have not been reclassified for this change 

fin no 48 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority upon the initial implementation of fin no 48 the company recorded a reduction of its january 1 2007 retained earnings of 433 million which is comprised of 329 million of tax and accrued interest of 173 million 104 million net of tax as the determination of fin no 48 liabilities and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s net income or financial condition 

other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated dividend distributions from nonus subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody’s 

operating segments

the mkmv business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services including credit processing software and analytical tools for credit portfolio management

  2008 outlook 

beginning in january 2008 moody’s segments were changed to reflect the business reorganization announced in august 2007 as a result of the reorganization the rating agency remains in the moody’s investors service “mis” operating company and several ratings business lines have been realigned all of moody’s other commercial activities including moody’s kmv and sales of mis research are now combined under a new operating company known as moody’s analytics moody’s new initiatives in fixed income pricing and valuations will also be captured within moody’s analytics 

moody’s outlook for 2008 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates corporate profitability and business investment spending merger and acquisition activity consumer spending residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity securitization levels and capital markets issuance there is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions moody’s results for the year may differ from our current outlook 

for moody’s overall fullyear 2008 revenue is expected to decline in the low doubledigit percent range this decline assumes foreign currency translation in 2008 at current exchange rates the company anticipates a weak first half of 2008 with improvement in market liquidity and issuance conditions later in the year under this scenario moody’s first half 2008 performance is likely to reflect unusually weak market conditions as well as challenging yearonyear comparisons against the first half of 2007 when the company delivered record performance the company expects the fullyear 2008 operating margin to decline to the mid to highforties percent range due primarily to lower ratings revenue fullyear expenses are expected to decrease approximately 5 primarily due to the 2007 restructuring charge of 500 million as well as expense savings from the restructuring actions partially offset by investments in the growth areas of our business earnings per share for 2008 are projected in a range from 217 to 225 which reflects the estimated impact of share buybacks under the company’s share repurchase program 

for the global moody’s investors service business the company expects revenue for the full year 2008 to decline in the midto highteens percent range within the us the company projects moody’s investors service revenue to decrease in the midtwenties percent range for the full year 2008 

in the us structured finance business moody’s expects revenue for the year to decline in the low to midforties percent range reflecting doubledigit percent declines in most asset classes led by residential mortgagebacked securities and credit derivatives ratings 

in the us corporate finance business the company expects revenue to decrease in the lowteens percent range for the year driven by declines across all asset classes 

in both the us financial institutions and public project and infrastructure finance sectors moody’s projects revenue in 2008 to grow in the low singledigit percent range 

outside the us the company expects moody’s investors service revenue to decrease in the low singledigit percent range good growth from rating financial institutions public project and infrastructure finance and corporate securities is expected to be more than offset by a decline in structured finance ratings revenue primarily in europe 

for moody’s analytics the company expects revenue growth in the midteens percent range in the us growth is projected to be in the lowteens percent range while outside the us revenue is expected to increase in the highteens percent range growth in the subscription businesses is expected in the midteens range reflecting continued demand for credit and economic research structured finance analytics and the impact of our newly formed pricing and valuation business in the consulting business moody’s anticipates very strong growth reflecting a robust pipeline of professional services engagements and credit training projects there is considerable demand for moody’s expertise in credit education risk modeling and scorecard development as customers implement more sophisticated risk management processes and comply with regulatory requirements in the software business the company expects revenue to be flat versus 2007 as customers begin to migrate to new generation software platforms

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations “sfas no141r” sfas no 141r extends its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses and establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired sfas 141r also expands disclosure requirements to improve the statement users’ abilities to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations sfas no 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and is required to be implemented by the company as of january 1 2009 the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of implementing sfas no 141r will have on its consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows

contingencies 

from time to time moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation that are incidental to the company’s business including claims based on ratings assigned by moody’s moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business management periodically assesses the company’s liabilities and contingencies based upon the latest information available 

  

moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings other than routine litigation incidental to moody’s business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate for matters except those related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate when sufficient uncertainties exist related to the outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly for income tax matters the company employs the prescribed methodology of fin no 48 implemented as of january 1 2007 fin no 48 requires a company to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 

moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities and is cooperating with those inquiries 

based on its review of the latest information available and subject to the contingencies described below in the opinion of management the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows although it is possible that the effect could be material to the company’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period 

legacy contingencies 

moody’s continues to have exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 distribution “legacy contingencies” the following description of the relationships among moody’s new db and their predecessor entities is important in understanding the legacy contingencies that relate to tax matters “legacy tax matters” 

in november 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation separated into three separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation acnielsen corporation and cognizant corporation “cognizant” in june 1998 the dun  bradstreet corporation separated into two separate public companies old db and rh donnelley corporation during 1998 cognizant separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated “ims health” and nielsen media research inc “nmr” in september 2000 old db separated into two separate public companies new db and moody’s as further described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

old db and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business including through taxfree restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities old db and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable irs rulings on certain tax matters and certain other potential tax liabilities all as described in such agreements further in connection with the 2000 distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement new db and moody’s have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to legacy tax matters 

settlement agreements were executed with the irs in 2005 regarding legacy tax matters for the years 19891990 and 19931996 as of december 31 2007 the company continues to carry a liability of 18 million with respect to these matters with respect to these settlement agreements moody’s and new db believe that ims health and nmr did not pay their full share of the liability to the irs pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements among the parties moody’s and new db paid these amounts to the irs on their behalf and have been unable to resolve this dispute with ims health and nmr as a result moody’s and new db have commenced arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr to collect a total of approximately 11 million owed by ims health and nmr with respect to the 19891990 matter moody’s and new db may also commence an arbitration proceeding to collect a total of 145 million owed by ims health and nmr with respect to the 19931996 matter moody’s cannot predict the outcome of these matters with any certainty 

amortization expense deductions and 19972002 irs deficiency notices the “notices” 

this legacy tax matter which was affected by developments in june 2007 as further described below involves a partnership transaction which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of old db since 1997 irs audits of old db’s and new db’s tax returns for the years 1997 through 2002 concluded in june 2007 without any disallowance of the amortization expense deductions or any other adjustments to income related to this partnership 

  

transaction these audits did result in the irs issuing the notices for other tax issues for the 19972000 years aggregating 95 million in tax and penalties plus statutory interest of approximately 7 million which will be apportioned among moody’s new db ims health and nmr pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements moody’s share of this assessment is anticipated to be 72 million including interest net of tax in november 2007 the irs assessed the tax and penalties and used a portion of the deposit discussed below to satisfy the assessment together with interest the company believes it has meritorious grounds to challenge the irs’s actions and is evaluating its alternatives for further actions to recover these amounts the absence of any tax deficiencies in the notices for the amortization expense deductions for the years 1997 through 2000 and in companion notices of deficiency issued to new db for 2001 and 2002 combined with the expiration of the statute of limitations for 1997 through 2002 for issues not assessed resulted in moody’s recording an earnings benefit of 523 million in its second quarter this is comprised of two components as follows i a reversal of a tax liability of 273 million related to the period from 1997 through the distribution date reducing the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2007 and ii a reduction of accrued interest expense of 175 million 106 million net of tax and an increase in other nonoperating income of 144 million relating to amounts due to new db for the year ended december 31 2007 

on the distribution date in 2000 new db paid moody’s 550 million for 50 of certain anticipated future tax benefits of new db through 2012 it is possible that irs audits of new db for tax years after 2002 could result in income adjustments with respect to the amortization expense deductions of this partnership transaction in the event these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by new db or there is an audit adjustment moody’s would be required pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement to repay to new db an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits and its share of any tax liability that new db incurs  as of december 31 2007 moody’s liability with respect to this matter totaled 528 million 

in march 2006 new db and moody’s each deposited 398 million with the irs in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years in july 2007 new db and moody’s commenced procedures to recover approximately 56 million of these deposits 244 million for new db and 316 million for moody’s which represents the excess of the original deposits over the total of the deficiencies asserted in the notices and in companion statutory notices of deficiency issued to new db for 2001 and 2002 as noted above in november 2007 the irs used 79 million of moody’s portion of the deposit to satisfy an assessment and related interest additionally in january 2008 the irs paid moody’s 85 million in connection with this matter 

at december 31 2007 moody’s has recorded liabilities for legacy tax matters totaling 567 million this includes liabilities and accrued interest due to new db arising from the 2000 distribution agreement it is possible that the ultimate liability for legacy tax matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the company which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody’s future reported results financial position and cash flows

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global public and private fixedincome markets have grown significantly in terms of outstanding principal amount and types of securities while there is potential for periodic cyclical disruption in these developments moody’s believes that the overall trend and outlook remain favorable for continued secular growth in capital market activity worldwide in addition the securities being issued in the global fixedincome markets are becoming more complex moody’s expects that these trends will provide continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions these phenomena are especially apparent internationally where economic expansion and integration are driving increased use of public fixedincome markets for corporate financing activities and factors such as enabling regulation and increased acceptance of new financial technologies by debt issuers and investors have driven growth in structured finance issuance 

communication technology such as the internet makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world this technology facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets issuers and investors are also more readily able to obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell many of which may be unfamiliar to them this availability of information promotes worldwide financial markets and a greater need for credible and globally comparable opinions about credit risk as a result a number of new capital markets have emerged in addition more issuers and investors are accessing developed capital markets 

another trend that is increasing the size of the world’s capital markets is the ongoing disintermediation of financial systems issuers are increasingly financing in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries are selling assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets structured finance securities markets for many types of assets have developed in many countries and are contributing to these trends 

the complexity of capital market instruments is also growing consequently assessing the credit risk of such instruments becomes more of a challenge for financial intermediaries and asset managers in the credit markets reliable thirdparty ratings and research increasingly supplement or substitute for traditional inhouse research as the scale geographic scope and complexity of financial markets grow 

growth in issuance of structured finance securities has generally been stronger than growth in straight corporate and financial institutions debt issuance and moody’s expects that trend to continue growth in structured finance has reflected increased acceptance of structured finance as a financing and refinancing mechanism regulatory changes that facilitate the use of structured finance and increases in the scope of asset types including for example consumer debt that form the underlying asset pools for structured finance securities 

rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of moody’s investors service therefore a substantial portion of moody’s revenue is dependent upon the volume and number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets that moody’s rates moody’s is therefore affected by the performance of and the prospects for the major world economies 

  

and by the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings subscriptionbased research and other areas are less dependent on or independent of the volume or number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets 

moody’s operations are also subject to various risks inherent in carrying on business internationally such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources however the formation of for example a new governmentsponsored regional or global rating agency would pose a risk to moody’s growth prospects management believes that this risk compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry is relatively low because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required with uncertainty about the likelihood of financial success 

legislative bodies and regulators in both the united states and europe continue to conduct regulatory reviews of credit rating agencies which may result in an increased number of competitors restrictions on certain business expansion activities by moody’s investors service or increased costs of doing business for moody’s at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities see “regulation” below 

growth in moody’s kmv is expected from increased awareness and adoption by financial institutions of active credit portfolio management and the estimation of economic capital for which mkmv provides products and services in addition moody’s kmv will continue to see revenue growth from the implementation of internal rating tools for basel ii compliance and credit analysis best practices this growth will be realized by for example the development of new private firm default probability models for specific countries and by expanding analysis capabilities of new asset classes 

competition 

the moody’s investors service business competes with other credit rating agencies and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research institutional investors also have inhouse credit research capabilities moody’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp’s in other markets the reverse is true 

in addition to sp moody’s competitors include fitch a subsidiary of fimalac sa dominion bond rating service ltd of canada “dbrs” and am best company inc one or more significant rating agencies may emerge in the united states as the securities and exchange commission “sec” may expand the number of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations “nrsro” competition may also emerge in developed or developing markets outside the united states over the next few years as the number of rating agencies increase 

financial regulators are reviewing their approach to supervision and have sought or are seeking comments on changes to the global regulatory framework that could affect moody’s bank regulators under the oversight of the basel committee on banking supervision have proposed using refined risk assessments as the basis for minimum capital requirements the proposed standardized approach relies on rating agency opinions while the proposed internal ratings based approach relies on systems and processes maintained by the regulated bank the increased regulatory focus on credit risk presents both opportunities and challenges for moody’s global demand for credit ratings and risk management services may rise but regulatory actions may result in a greater number of rating agencies andor additional regulation of moody’s and its competitors alternatively banking or securities market regulators could seek to reduce the use of ratings in regulations thereby reducing certain elements of demand for ratings or otherwise seek to control the analysis or business of rating agencies 

credit rating agencies such as moody’s also compete with other means of managing credit risk such as credit insurance competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk also may pose a competitive threat to moody’s 

moody’s kmv’s main competitors for quantitative measures of default risk include the riskmetrics group sp creditsights ri’s financial technology institute in japan fitch algorithmics dun and bradstreet models developed internally by customers and other smaller vendors other firms may compete in the future baker hill acquired by experian and bureau van dijk electronic publishing are moody’s kmv’s main competitors in the software market to assist banks in their commercial lending activities mercer oliver wyman competes with the professional services group at moody’s kmv for certain credit risk consulting services business 

  

moody’s strategy 

moody’s intends to focus on the following opportunities 

expansion in financial centers 

moody’s serves its customers through its global network of offices and business affiliations moody’s currently maintains comprehensive rating and marketing operations in financial centers including frankfurt hong kong london madrid milan new york paris singapore sydney and tokyo moody’s expects that its global network will position it to benefit from the expansion of worldwide capital markets and thereby increase revenue moody’s also expects that the growth of its moody’s investors service business as a consequence of financial market integration in europe will continue additionally moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures this will allow moody’s to extend its credit opinion franchise to local and regional obligors through domestic currency ratings and national scale ratings these developing market efforts have been supported in 2006 by the acquisition of 100 of cra rating agency in the czech republic to form moody’s central europe and the acquisition of a 49 stake in china cheng xin international credit rating co ltd in china and in january 2007 by the acquisition of 99 of pt kasnic credit rating in indonesia to form moody’s indonesia moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures 

new rating products 

moody’s is pursuing numerous initiatives to expand credit ratings including from public fixedincome securities markets to other sectors with credit risk exposures within established capital markets moody’s continues to expand its rating coverage of bank loans and project finance loans and securities in global and local counterparty markets moody’s offers distinct sets of rating products to address the creditworthiness of financial firms including bank financial strength and deposit ratings and insurance financial strength ratings moody’s has also introduced issuer ratings for corporations not active in the debt markets as the structured finance markets continue to grow worldwide and secondary markets continue to develop demand for research data and analysis supporting these markets has heightened in order to capitalize on market developments and to enhance ratings surveillance efficiency moody’s has created a new products group within structured finance to focus on new ratings products such as hedge fund operations quality ratings and to identify design develop and maintain valueadded research analytics and data products serving the structured finance market the acquisition of wall street analytics in december 2006 broadens moody’s capabilities in the analysis and monitoring of complex debt securities and provides a deeper pool of dedicated analytic and product development staff to create new software analytic tools for the structured finance market 

in response to growing investor demand for expanded credit opinion in the high yield market moody’s has introduced a number of new products including joint default analysis corporate financial metrics and both lossgivendefault and probabilityofdefault ratings 

additional opportunities in structured finance 

the repackaging of financial assets has had a profound effect on the fixedincome markets new patterns of securitization are expected to emerge in the next decade although the bulk of assets securitized in the past five years have been consumer assets owned by banks commercial assets — principally commercial mortgages term receivables and corporate obligations — are now increasingly being securitized securitization has evolved into a strategic corporate finance tool in north america europe and japan and is evolving elsewhere internationally ongoing global development of nontraditional financial instruments especially credit derivatives has accelerated in recent years increasingly complex collateralized debt obligations “cdo”s have been introduced which should continue to support growth moody’s has introduced new services enabling investors to monitor the performance of their investments in structured finance covering assetbacked finance commercial mortgage finance residential mortgage finance and credit derivatives 

internetenhanced products and services 

moody’s is expanding its use of the internet and other electronic media to enhance client service moody’s website provides the public with instant access to ratings and provides the public and subscribers with credit research internet delivery also enables moody’s to provide services to more individuals within a client organization than were available with paperbased products and to offer highervalue services because of more timely delivery moody’s expects that access to these applications will increase client use of moody’s services moody’s expects to continue to invest in electronic media to capitalize on these and other opportunities 

  

expansion of credit research products and investment analytic tools 

moody’s plans to expand its research and analytic services through internal development and by acquisition to respond to client demand new product initiatives are generally more analytical and dataintensive than traditional narrative research offerings such services address investor interest in replicating the monitoring activities conducted by for example moody’s securitization analysts and provide the means for customers to gain access to raw data and ratios used by moody’s analysts in the rating process for municipalities companies and financial institutions these products represent important sources of growth for the research business unit moreover moody’s continues to explore opportunities to extend its research relevance in new domestic or regional markets eg china as well as new functional markets eg hedge funds 

new quantitative credit risk assessment services 

moody’s will continue to provide banks and other institutions with quantitative credit risk assessment services moody’s believes that there will be increased demand for such services because they assist customers trading or holding creditsensitive assets to produce better performance also recent proposals by international bank regulatory authorities to recognize banks’ internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining regulatory capital are expected to encourage adoption of such services by banks from thirdparty providers moody’s also expects to provide extensions to existing services and new services such as valuations of creditsensitive assets 

regulation 

in the united states moody’s investors service has been designated as a nrsro by the sec the sec first applied the nrsro designation in 1975 to companies whose credit ratings could be used by brokerdealers for purposes of determining their net capital requirements since that time congress including in certain mortgagerelated legislation the sec including in certain of its regulations under the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and the investment company act of 1940 as amended and other governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of nrsros to distinguish between among other things “investment grade” and “noninvestment grade” securities moody’s investors service has also voluntarily registered with the sec as a nrsro under the investment advisers act of 1940 as amended once sec rules under the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 discussed below are promulgated and become effective approved nrsros will be required to register pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 

over the past several years us regulatory and congressional authorities have reviewed the suitability of continuing to use ratings in federal securities laws and if such use is continued the potential need for altering the regulatory framework under which rating agencies operate this review ultimately resulted in the passage of the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 “reform act” in september 2006 the stated objectives of the reform act are to foster competition transparency and accountability in the credit rating industry it makes changes to the sec’s processes for designating rating agencies as nrsros and formalizes the framework through which the sec oversees them however the legislation provides that the sec shall not regulate the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any nrsro determines credit ratings the reform act requires the sec to issue final implementing rules by june 26 2007 on february 5 2007 the sec published for comment its proposed rules addressing registration recordkeeping financial reporting policies for handling of material nonpublic information and managing conflicts of interest and certain prohibitions against unfair coercive or abusive practices interested parties have until march 12 2007 to submit comments to the sec moody’s is reviewing the proposed rules and intends to submit comments to the sec 

internationally several regulatory developments have occurred 

iosco —in december 2004 the technical committee of the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” published the code of conduct fundamentals for credit rating agencies the “iosco code” the iosco code is the product of approximately two years of collaboration among iosco rating agencies and market participants and incorporates provisions that address three broad areas 

 

  

  

 the iosco code is not binding on credit rating agencies it relies on voluntary compliance and public disclosure of areas of noncompliance by credit rating agencies so that users of credit ratings can better assess rating agency behavior and performance 

  

moody’s investors service endorsed the iosco code and in june 2005 published its code of professional conduct the “moody’s code” pursuant to the iosco code in april 2006 moody’s investors service published its first annual report on the implementation of moody’s code the report discusses policies procedures and processes that implement the moody’s code the report also describes differences between the moody’s code and the iosco code and how moody’s believes that the objectives of the iosco code are otherwise addressed both moody’s code and the report can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

european union —the european commission “commission” issued a communication on rating agencies in january 2006 the commission noted that recent european union “eu” financial services legislative measures that are relevant to credit rating agencies combined with a selfregulatory framework for rating agencies based on the iosco code provided a suitable framework for the oversight of rating agencies and that no legislative actions were required at the time the commission indicated that it would monitor developments related to rating agencies and asked the committee of european securities regulators “cesr” to monitor rating agencies’ compliance with the iosco code and report back regularly 

cesr completed a process to assess such compliance and published a report in january 2007 the cesr process focused on four internationally active rating agencies that operate in the european union including moody’s and involved discussions with the individual rating agencies as well as a survey of market participants cesr concluded that the four rating agencies are largely compliant with the iosco code and identified a few areas where it believed rating agencies could improve their processes and disclosures and where the iosco code could be improved cesr indicated that for its 2007 report it will look into these areas in particular as well as the impact of the reform act and the sec’s implementing rules on the rating business in the european union as a result of the cesr report in january 2007 the commission reiterated its stance that the selfregulatory approach was at present the appropriate regulatory framework for rating agencies in europe 

the basel committee —in june 2004 the basel committee on banking supervision published a new capital adequacy framework “basel ii” to replace its initial 1988 framework under basel ii ratings assigned by recognized credit rating agencies called external credit assessment institutions or “ecais” could be used by banks in determining credit risk weights for many of their institutional credit exposures national authorities will begin implementing these aspects of basel ii during 2007 recognized ecais could be subject to a broader range of oversight 

in the eu basel ii has been adopted through the capital requirements directive “crd” which among other things sets out criteria for recognizing ecais within the eu the commission created the committee of european banking supervisors “cebs” comprised of european banking regulators to advise it on banking policy issues that include implementing the crd in january 2006 cebs published guidelines that provide the basis for a consistent approach by eu member states to the implementation of the crd’s ecai recognition and supervision criteria moody’s completed an application process pursuant to the cebs guidelines and in august 2006 cebs announced a shared view among eu banking authorities that moody’s should be recognized as an ecai however as each member state must formally recognize ecais for use in its jurisdiction the recognition process is ongoing 

bank regulators in other jurisdictions globally have begun the ecai recognition process and moody’s has been recognized in several jurisdictions at this time moody’s cannot predict the longterm impact of basel ii on the manner in which the company conducts its business however moody’s does not currently believe that basel ii will materially affect its financial position or results of operations 

other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services has been considered from time to time by local national and multinational bodies and is likely to be considered in the future in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies in addition governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could significantly change the competitive landscape in which moody’s operates in addition the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of moody’s cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings regulatory or legislative actions or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occur moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets 

approximately 80 of moody’s revenue in 2006 was derived from ratings a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of creditsensitive securities in the global capital markets the company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets therefore the company’s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance 

unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which moody’s provides ratings services in addition increases in interest rates or credit spreads volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment significant regulatory political or economic events defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers andor the types of creditsensitive products being offered a sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse effect on moody’s business and financial results 

possible loss of market share or revenue through competition or regulation 

the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive moody’s competes on the basis of a number of factors including quality of ratings customer service research reputation regulatory qualification price geographic scope range of products and technological innovation for example a large investment grade default could impact the company’s reputation and potentially lead to greater regulatory oversight moody’s faces competition from among others sp fitch dbrs local rating agencies in a number of international jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company inc with respect to the insurance industry since moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the us it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions that moody’s does not receive 

currently moody’s sp fitch dbrs and am best company inc are designated as nrsros by the sec in september 2006 the united states congress passed into law the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 as a direct result the sec is mandated to complete a rulemaking process which implements the legislation see “regulation” above for further information by june 2007 at present moody’s is unable to assess the impact of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec’s rulemaking process 

introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies 

the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and to utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s moody’s growth prospects could also be adversely affected by limitations of its information technologies that fail to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products 

increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and service if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors moody’s may lose market share 

  

possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures 

moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis moody’s may lose key employees due to other factors such as catastrophes that could lead to disruption of business operations moody’s ability to compete effectively will continue to depend among other things on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees 

exposure to litigation related to moody’s rating opinions 

moody’s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions in addition as moody’s international business expands these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the first amendment these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time 

potential emergence of governmentsponsored credit rating agencies 

when governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected governmentmandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness in these circumstances debt issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating which may negatively affect the company 

potential for new us foreign state and local legislation and regulations including those relating to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 

in the united states and other countries the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and are presently subject to review by a number of legislative or regulatory bodies including the sec in the united states and the cesr on behalf of the european union it is possible that such reviews could lead to greater oversight or regulation concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies such additional regulations could potentially increase the costs associated with the operation of a credit rating agency alter the rating agencies’ communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings change the regulatory framework to which credit rating agencies are subject andor affect the competitive environment in which credit rating agencies operate a description of certain of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the united states and other countries is described above under the section entitled “regulation” in item 1 “business” of this form 10k at present moody’s is unable to predict the regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the sec or other regulatory bodies or the effect that any such changes may have on its business 

exposure to increased risk from multinational operations 

moody’s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the us operations in different countries expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations of the company in the future

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets pension and other postretirement benefits and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

revenue recognition 

in recognizing revenue related to ratings moody’s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods in such cases the company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods 

the portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers the estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities currently the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 deferred revenue included approximately 47 million 36 million and 30 million respectively related to such deferred monitoring fees 

  

additionally in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on the lives of the rated securities currently the monitoring periods range from five to 46 years at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 deferred revenue related to commercial mortgagebacked securities was approximately 62 million 50 million and 37 million respectively 

moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 accounts receivable included approximately 34 million 31 million and 29 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically the company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 

accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance adjustments to and writeoffs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its reviews moody’s establishes or adjusts allowances as considered appropriate this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the abovenoted factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in revenue adjustments that are greater or less than moody’s estimates in each of 2006 2005 and 2004 the company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in the “contingencies” section of this “management’s discussion and analysis” commencing on page 28 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate  the company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may in the future adjust the provisions made in respect thereof since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the company has reserved their resolution could have a material adverse effect on moody’s future reported results and financial position in addition potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material 

for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 the provision for income taxes reflected credits of 24 million 88 million and charges of 30 million respectively due to changes in the company’s reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by moody’s in connection with its separation from old db in october 2000 these tax matters are discussed under “legacy tax matters” below 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates in estimating future operating results and cash flows moody’s considers internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates and the effects of external factors and market conditions if actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the company’s judgments or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which charge could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the expenses assets liabilities and obligations that moody’s reports for pension and other postretirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

 the discount rate selected to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligations as of december 31 2006 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares the plans’ projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined 

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s pension and other postretirement benefits 

when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise to the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” “sfas no 87” the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants for moody’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans the total losses as of december 31 2006 which have not been recognized in annual expense are  410 million and moody’s expects to recognize 22 million of actuarial losses in 2007 annual net periodic benefit expense 

for moody’s funded pension plan the differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense as permitted under sfas no 87 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a fiveyear period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets which is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization as of december 31 2006 the company has an unrecognized asset gain of 78 million of which 33 million will be recognized in the market related value of assets which is used to calculate the expected return on assets component in 2008 expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2007 operating income dollars in millions these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2007 assets liabilities obligations and expenses related to pension and other postretirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2007 projected expenses based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to pension and postretirement plans will be approximately 

  

144 million in 2007 compared with 149 million in 2006 the expected expense decrease in 2007 reflects the effects of higher discount rates higher plan asset gains and lower amortization of actuarial losses which are partially offset by normal growth in plan liabilities 

stockbased compensation 

on january 1 2006 the company adopted under the modified prospective application method the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” under this pronouncement companies are required to record compensation expense for all sharebased payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans stock options restricted stock and stock appreciation rights previously on january 1 2003 the company adopted on a prospective basis the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company which is limited the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 

an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2006 dollars in millions 

 

 other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated dividend distributions from nonus subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact moody’s 

operating segments 

moody’s investors service consists of four rating groups — structured finance corporate finance financial institutions and sovereign risk and public finance — that generate revenue principally from the assignment of i credit ratings on issuers and issues of fixedincome obligations in the debt markets and ii research which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investororiented credit information and research principally produced by the rating groups and economic commentary for presentation purposes europe represents europe the middle east and africa and public finance represents us public finance given the dominance of moody’s investors service to moody’s overall results the company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses nor are such expenses allocated between the company’s business segments accordingly all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the moody’s investors service segment and none have been allocated to the moody’s kmv segment 

the moody’s kmv business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks corporations and investors in creditsensitive assets

the company also currently expects to use a significant portion of its cash flow to continue its share repurchase program the company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an sec rule 10b51 program moody’s may also purchase opportunistically when conditions warrant on june 5 2006 the board of directors authorized a 2 billion share repurchase program there is no established expiration date for this authorization during 

  

august 2006 the company had completed its previous 1 billion share repurchase program which had been authorized by the board of directors in october 2005 the company’s intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves moody’s longterm interests as a result moody’s share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter 

the company entered into an operating lease agreement the “lease” commencing on october 20 2006 with 7 world trade center llc for 589945 square feet of an office building located at 7 world trade center at 250 greenwich street new york new york which will serve as moody’s new headquarters the lease has an initial term of approximately 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options the total base rent of the lease over its initial 21year term is approximately 536 million including rent credits from the world trade center rent reduction program promulgated by the empire state development corporation the company will incur approximately 110 million of costs in 2007 to fit out the new headquarters the costs will be paid for using the proceeds from the sale of the company’s current corporate headquarters building

indebtedness 

on september 30 2005 the company entered into a note purchase agreement and issued and sold through a private placement transaction 300 million aggregate principal amount of its series 20051 senior unsecured notes “notes” the notes have a tenyear term and bear interest at an annual rate of 498 payable semiannually on march 30 and september 30 the proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to refinance 300 million aggregate principal amount of the company’s outstanding 761 senior notes “old notes” which matured on september 30 2005 in the event that moody’s pays all or part of the notes in advance of their maturity the “prepaid principal” such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess if any of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments as defined in the agreement over the prepaid principal 

on september 1 2004 moody’s entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured bank revolving credit facility the “facility” in an aggregate principal amount of 160 million that expires in september 2009 this facility replaced the 80 million fiveyear facility that was scheduled to expire in september 2005 and the 80 million 364day facility that expired in september 2004 interest on borrowings under the facility is payable at rates that are based on the london interbank offered rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 475 basis points depending on the company’s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “earnings coverage ratio” as defined in the related agreement at december 31 2006 such premium was 17 basis points the company also pays quarterly facility fees regardless of borrowing activity under the facility the quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the facility amount to 15 basis points depending on the company’s earnings coverage ratio and were 8 basis points at december 31 2006 under the facility the company also pays a utilization fee of 125 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the facility exceeds 50 of the facility 

management may consider pursuing additional longterm financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities which would result in higher financing costs 

the notes and the facility the “agreements” contain covenants that among other things restrict the ability of the company and certain of its subsidiaries without the approval of the lenders to engage in mergers consolidations asset sales transactions with affiliates and saleleaseback transactions or to incur liens as defined in the related agreements the facility also contains financial covenants that among other things require the company to maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and an earnings coverage ratio as defined in the agreement of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter at december 31 2006 the company was in compliance with such covenants upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the agreements all loans outstanding under the agreements including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the agreements may be terminated in addition certain other events of default under the agreements would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated 

in october 2006 moody’s amended its facility by increasing the limit on sale proceeds resulting from a saleleaseback transaction of its corporate headquarters building at 99 church street from 150 million to 250 million additionally the 

  

restriction on liens to secure indebtedness related to the sale of 99 church street was also increased from 150 million to 250 million the company also increased the expansion feature of the credit facility from 80 million to 340 million subject to obtaining commitments for the incremental capacity at the time of draw down from the existing lenders this increase gives the company potential borrowing capacity under the facility of 500 million 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2006 and 2005 moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where moody’s is the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such moody’s is not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents payments due under the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 

 

     2007 outlook 

moody’s outlook for 2007 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates corporate profitability and business investment spending merger and acquisition activity consumer spending residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity securitization levels and capital markets issuance there is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions moody’s results for the year may differ from the current outlook 

for moody’s overall the company projects low doubledigit percent revenue growth for the full year 2007 this growth assumes foreign currency translation in 2007 at current exchange rates which would result in no material full year impact from currency translation excluding the gain on sale of the 99 church street building moody’s expects the operating margin to decline by approximately 150 basis points in 2007 due to investments the company is continuing to make to sustain business growth including international expansion improving analytical processes pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives introducing new products improving technology infrastructure and relocating moody’s headquarters in new york city diluted earnings per share in 2007 are projected to be modestly lower compared to 2006 as a result of the aftertax gain of 941 million on the sale of the 99 church street headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006 

in the us the company projects low doubledigit percent revenue growth for the moody’s investors service ratings and research business for the full year 2007 in the us structured finance business moody’s expects revenue for the year to rise 

  

in the highsingle to doubledigit percent range including strong doubledigit yearoveryear percent growth in revenue from credit derivatives and commercial mortgagebacked securities ratings partially offset by an expected decline in revenue from residential mortgagebacked securities ratings including home equity securitization 

in the us corporate finance business moody’s expects revenue growth in the low doubledigit percent range for the year including good growth from rated bonds bank loans and new products the company anticipates a stronger first half of 2007 followed by a weaker second half in this sector due in part to an expected moderation in the pace of leveraged buyout transactions 

in the us financial institutions sector the company projects revenue in 2007 to grow in the low teens percent range for the year for the us public finance sector moody’s expects revenue for 2007 to grow modestly the company forecasts growth in the us research business to be about 20 

outside the us moody’s expects ratings revenue to grow in the highteens percent range with mid to highteens percent growth in all major business lines led by corporate finance revenue growth in europe and asia financial institutions growth in europe and growth in international structured finance the company also projects about twenty percent growth in international research revenue 

for moody’s kmv globally the company expects growth in sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products credit decision processing software and professional services this should result in low doubledigit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin no 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin no 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on recognition and derecognition of tax benefits resulting from a subsequent change of judgment classification of liabilities interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure in accordance with fin no 48 a company is required to first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date in making this assessment a company must assume that the taxing authority will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority without considering time values fin no 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and accordingly is required to be adopted by the company on january 1 2007 upon adoption of fin no 48 on january 1 2007 the company expects a reduction of retained earnings of between 40 million and 45 million with no impact to the statement of operations and cash flows this is based on a preliminary assessment and could change based on final analysis which will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2007 after the initial adoption of fin no 48 the financial impacts to the statement of operations and cash flows is dependent upon the ultimate resolution of legacy tax matters and other tax matters with the taxing authorities the company is unable to predict the final resolution of these matters see note 16 “contingencies” for further discussion of legacy tax matters 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value whereby fair value is based on an exit price that would result from market participants’ behavior as well as sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fairvalue measurements sfas no 157 is expected to increase the consistency of fair value measurements and applies only to those measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards except for measurements of sharebased payments and measurements that are similar to but not intended to be fair value sfas no 157 imposes no requirements for additional fairvalue measures in financial statements and is effective for fairvalue measures already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and will be adopted by the company as of january 1 2008 the company is currently assessing the impacts that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 

contingencies 

from time to time moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation that are incidental to the company’s business including claims based on ratings assigned by moody’s moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits 

  

in the normal course of business management periodically assesses the company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings other than routine litigation incidental to moody’s business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate for those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate in other instances because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 

based on its review of the latest information available in the opinion of management the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on moody’s financial position results of operations or cash flows subject to the contingencies described below 

legacy contingencies 

moody’s has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 distribution these contingencies are referred to by moody’s as “legacy contingencies” the principal legacy contingencies presently outstanding relate to tax matters 

to understand the company’s exposure to the potential liabilities described below it is important to understand the relationship between moody’s and new db and the relationship among new db and its predecessors and other parties who through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters 

in november 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation through a spinoff separated into three separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation acnielsen corporation “acnielsen” and cognizant corporation “cognizant” in june 1998 the dun  bradstreet corporation through a spinoff separated into two separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation and rh donnelley corporation during 1998 cognizant through a spinoff separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated “ims health” and nielsen media research inc “nmr” in september 2000 old db through a spinoff separated into two separate public companies new db and moody’s as further described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

legacy tax matters 

old db and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business including through taxfree restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 

pursuant to a series of agreements as between themselves ims health and nmr are jointly and severally liable to pay onehalf and new db and moody’s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half of any payments for taxes penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable internal revenue service “irs” rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements excluding the matter described below as “amortization expense deductions” for which new db and moody’s are solely responsible and certain other potential tax liabilities also as described in such agreements 

in connection with the 2000 distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement new db and moody’s have between themselves agreed to be financially responsible for any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations 

without limiting the generality of the foregoing three specific tax matters are discussed below 

royalty expense deductions 

this matter related to the irs’s stated intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old db on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 as well as the irs’s intention to reallocate to old db income and expense items that had been reported in a certain partnership tax return for 1996 these matters were settled with the irs in a closing agreement executed in the third quarter of 2005 and accordingly the company reduced its reserve for this matter by 115 million however ims health and nmr disagreed with new db’s calculation of each party’s share of the liability new db may commence arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr to collect the 73 million that new db and moody’s each were obligated to pay to the irs on their behalf based upon the current understanding of the positions that new db and ims health may take the company believes it is likely that new db will prevail but moody’s cannot predict with certainty the outcome 

  

in the second quarter of 2006 moody’s paid approximately 9 million for the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the october 2005 settlement with the irs and reversed the remaining reserve of 15 million 

additionally the irs reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by old db related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993 in the fourth quarter of 2005 new db filed a protest with the irs appeals office concerning the irs’s denial of the tax refunds in the third quarter of 2006 the irs appeals office rejected new db’s protest new db is determining whether to file suit for the refund moody’s share is estimated at approximately 9 million 

amortization expense deductions 

in april 2004 new db received examination reports the “april examination reports” from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1997 which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of old db since 1997 these deductions could continue through 2012 in the april examination reports the irs stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by old db on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns the irs also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old db on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction in addition the irs stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to old db certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998 new db disagrees with these positions taken by the irs irs audits of old db’s or new db’s tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar examination reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years similar examination reports could result for tax years subsequent to 2002 

should any such payments be made by new db related to either the april examination reports or any potential examination reports for future years including years subsequent to the separation of moody’s from new db then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement moody’s would have to pay to new db its share in addition should new db discontinue claiming the amortization expense deductions on future tax returns moody’s would be required pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement to repay to new db an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits new db had paid the discounted value of 50 of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to moody’s at the distribution date moody’s estimates that the company’s potential exposures including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits could be up to 120 million relating to the disallowance of amortization expense deductions and could increase by approximately 6 million to 10 million per year depending on actions that the irs may take and on whether new db continues claiming the amortization expense deductions on its tax returns additionally there are potential exposures that could be up to 164 million relating to the reallocation of the partnership income and expense to old db moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability 

new db is currently in discussion with the irs on these issues on march 3 2006 new db and moody’s each deposited 398 million with the irs in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies up to or equal to that amount with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years 

moody’s believes that the irs’s proposed assessments of tax against old db and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to old db are inconsistent with each other accordingly while it is possible that the irs could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions moody’s believes that it is unlikely that the irs will prevail on both 

utilization of capital losses 

in december 2004 new db executed a formal settlement agreement for all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by old db during 1989 and 1990 new db received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of 2005 the third and final assessment was received in april 2006 of which moody’s paid 03 million the amounts paid by moody’s for the first two assessments included its share of approximately 4 million that moody’s and new db believe should have been paid by ims health and nmr but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of new db’s calculation of their respective shares of the payments new db was unable to resolve this dispute with ims health and nmr and has commenced arbitration proceedings against them moody’s believes that new db should prevail in its position but the company cannot predict with certainty the outcome in the first quarter of 2005 moody’s had increased its liabilities by 27 million due to this disagreement 

summary of moody’s exposure to legacy tax related matters 

the company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to its legacy tax matters and establishes liabilities that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances in doing so moody’s makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 

  

for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 the company recorded 24 million and 88 million net reversals of reserves and increased reserves by 300 million respectively the company also has recorded 35 million 58 million and 34 million of net interest expense related to its legacy tax matters in the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively moody’s total recorded net legacy tax related liabilities as of december 31 2006 were 93 million and are classified as long term 

it is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the liabilities recorded by the company which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody’s future reported results financial position and cash flows in matters where moody’s believes the irs has taken inconsistent positions moody’s may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments however moody’s believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the irs would retain such duplicative payments 

dividends 

during 2006 the company paid a quarterly dividend of 007 per share in each of the quarters of moody’s common stock resulting in dividends paid per share of 028 during the year during 2005 the company paid a quarterly dividend of 00375 in the first quarter and 0055 in each of the three subsequent quarters per share of moody’s common stock resulting in dividends paid per share of 02025 during the year during 2004 the company paid quarterly dividends of 00375 per share of moody’s common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of 015 

on december 12 2006 the board of directors of the company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of 008 per share of moody’s common stock payable on march 10 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 20 2007 the continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above or at all is subject to the discretion of the board of directors

 item 1 business 

background 

as used in this report except where the context indicates otherwise the terms “moody’s” or “the company” refer to moody’s corporation and its subsidiaries the company’s executive offices are located at 99 church street new york ny 10007 and its telephone number is 212 5530300 

prior to september 30 2000 the company operated as part of the dun  bradstreet corporation “old db” on september 8 2000 the board of directors of old db approved a plan to separate into two publicly traded companies – the company and the new db corporation “new db” on september 30 2000 “the distribution date” old db distributed to its shareholders all of the outstanding shares of new db common stock the “2000 distribution” new db comprised the business of old db’s dun  bradstreet operating company the “db business” the remaining business of old db consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services the “moody’s business” and was renamed “moody’s corporation” 

new db is the accounting successor to old db which was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on april 8 1998 old db began operating as an independent publiclyowned corporation on july 1 1998 as a result of its june 30 1998 spinoff the “1998 distribution” from the corporation now known as “rh donnelley corporation” and previously known as “the dun  bradstreet corporation” “donnelley” old db became the accounting successor to donnelley at the time of the 1998 distribution 

prior to the 1998 distribution donnelley was the parent holding company for subsidiaries then engaged in the businesses currently conducted by new db moody’s and donnelley prior to november 1 1996 it also was the parent holding company of subsidiaries conducting business under the names cognizant corporation “cognizant” and acnielsen corporation “acnielsen” on that date donnelley effected a spinoff of the capital stock of cognizant and acnielsen to its stockholders the “1996 distribution” cognizant subsequently changed its name to nielsen media research inc in connection with its 1998 spinoff of the capital stock of ims health incorporated “ims health” 

for purposes of governing certain ongoing relationships between the company and new db after the 2000 distribution and to provide for an orderly transition the company and new db entered into various agreements including a distribution agreement tax allocation agreement employee benefits agreement shared transaction services agreement insurance and risk management services agreement data services agreement and transition services agreement 

detailed descriptions of the 1996 1998 and 2000 distributions are contained in the company’s 2000 annual report on form 10k filed on march 15 2001 

the company

prospects for growth 

over recent decades global public and private fixedincome markets have grown significantly in terms of outstanding principal amount and types of securities while there is potential for periodic cyclical disruption in these developments moody’s believes that the overall trend and outlook remain favorable for continued secular growth in capital market activity worldwide in addition the securities being issued in the global fixedincome markets are becoming more complex moody’s expects that these trends will provide continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions these phenomena are especially apparent internationally where economic integration is driving increased use of public fixedincome markets for corporate financing activities and factors such as increased adoption and enabling regulation have driven growth in structured finance issuance 

technology such as the internet makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world this technology facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets issuers and investors are also more readily able to obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell many of which may be unfamiliar to them this availability of 

  

information promotes worldwide financial markets and a greater need for credible and globally comparable credit ratings as a result a number of new capital markets have emerged in addition more issuers and investors are accessing developed capital markets 

another trend that is increasing the size of the world capital markets is the ongoing disintermediation of financial systems issuers are increasingly financing in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries are selling assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets structured finance securities markets for many types of assets have developed in many countries and are contributing to these trends 

the complexity of capital market instruments is also growing consequently assessing the credit risk of such instruments becomes more of a challenge for financial intermediaries and asset managers in the credit markets reliable thirdparty ratings and research increasingly supplement or substitute for traditional inhouse research as the scale geographic scope and complexity of financial markets grow 

growth in issuance of structured finance securities has generally been stronger than growth in corporate and financial institutions issuance and moody’s expects that trend to continue growth in structured finance has reflected increased adoption of structured finance as an acceptable financing mechanism regulatory changes that facilitate the use of structured finance and increases in consumer debt that forms collateral for structured securities 

rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of moody’s investors service therefore a substantial portion of moody’s revenue is dependent upon the volume and number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets that moody’s rates moody’s is therefore affected by the performance of and the prospects for the major world economies and by the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings subscriptionbased research and other areas are less dependent on or independent of the volume or number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets 

moody’s operations are also subject to various risks inherent in carrying on business internationally such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources however the formation of for example a new governmentsponsored regional or global rating agency would pose a risk to moody’s growth prospects management believes that this risk compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry is relatively low because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required 

legislative bodies and regulators in both the united states and europe continue to conduct regulatory reviews of credit rating agencies which may result in an increased number of competitors restrictions on certain business expansion activities by moody’s investors service or increased costs of doing business for moody’s at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities see “regulation” below 

growth in moody’s kmv is expected from increased adoption of quantitative credit management techniques and of integrated riskmanagement solutions by financial institutions globally and by corporations managing for example trade receivables increased use of credit models is expected under the forthcoming revised international bank regulatory regime known as “basel ii” that is anticipated to be implemented by national regulatory authorities by january 2007 moody’s kmv also expects to introduce new products 

  

competition 

the moody’s investors service business competes with other credit rating agencies and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research institutional investors also have inhouse credit research capabilities moody’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp’s in other markets the reverse is true 

another rating agency competitor of moody’s is fitch a subsidiary of fimalac sa although moody’s and sp are each larger than fitch competition is expected to increase one or more additional significant rating agencies also may emerge in the united states as the securities and exchange commission “sec” has expanded and may continue to expand the number of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations “nrsro” in february 2003 the sec designated dominion bond rating service ltd of canada “dbrs” a nrsro and in march 2005 the sec designated am best company inc a nrsro competition may also emerge in developed markets outside the united states over the next few years for example in response to the growth in the european capital markets and in developing markets any such rating agencies that may emerge may receive support from local governments or other institutions 

additional rating agencies have been established primarily in emerging markets and as a result of local capital market regulation regulators worldwide have perceived that credit ratings can further regulatory objectives for the development of public fixedincome securities markets the result has been the creation of a number of primarily national rating agencies in various countries certain of these regulatory efforts may have the unintended effect of producing less credible ratings over time attempts to standardize ratings systems or criteria may make all rating systems and agencies appear undifferentiated obscuring variations in the quality of the ratings providers in addition since moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the united states it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets 

financial regulators are reviewing their approach to supervision and are seeking comments on changes to the global regulatory framework bank regulators under the oversight of the basel committee on banking supervision have proposed using refined risk assessments as the basis for minimum capital requirements the proposed standardized approach relies on rating agency opinions while the proposed internal ratings based approach relies on systems and processes maintained by the regulated bank the increased regulatory focus on credit risk presents both opportunities and challenges for moody’s global demand for credit ratings and risk management services may rise but regulatory actions may result in a greater number of rating agencies andor additional regulation of moody’s and its competitors alternatively banking or securities market regulators could seek to reduce the use of ratings in regulations thereby reducing certain elements of demand for ratings or otherwise seek to control the analysis or business of rating agencies 

credit rating agencies such as moody’s also compete with other means of managing credit risk such as credit insurance competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk also may pose a competitive threat to moody’s 

moody’s kmv’s main competitors for quantitative measures of default risk include the riskmetrics group sp creditsights ri’s financial technology institute in japan fitch algorithmics dun and bradstreet models developed internally by customers and other smaller vendors other firms may compete in the future baker hill acquired by experian ecredit and bureau van dijk electronic publishing are moody’s kmv’s main competitors in the software market to assist banks in their commercial lending activities mercer oliver wyman competes with the professional services group at moody’s kmv for certain credit risk consulting services business 

  

moody’s strategy 

moody’s intends to focus on the following opportunities 

expansion in financial centers 

moody’s serves its customers through its global network of offices and business affiliations moody’s currently maintains fullservice rating and marketing operations in financial centers including frankfurt hong kong london madrid milan new york paris singapore and tokyo moody’s expects that its global network will position it to benefit from the expansion of worldwide capital markets and thereby increase revenue moody’s also expects that the growth of its moody’s investors service business as a consequence of financial market integration in europe will continue moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures 

new rating products 

moody’s is pursuing numerous initiatives to expand credit ratings from public fixedincome securities markets to other sectors with credit risk exposures within established capital markets moody’s continues to expand its rating coverage of bank loans and project finance loans and securities in developing markets moody’s seeks to extend its credit opinion franchise to local and regional obligors through domestic currency ratings and national scale ratings in global and local counterparty markets moody’s offers a distinct set of rating products to address the creditworthiness of financial firms through bank financial strength and deposit ratings and through insurance financial strength ratings moody’s has also introduced issuer ratings for corporations not active in the debt markets for company ratings moody’s seeks to continue to add value through the enhanced analysis initiative by providing greater scope and depth of analysis of issues related to company creditworthiness including enhanced liquidity and cash flow analysis and evaluation of accounting corporate governance and risk transference issues moody’s has also introduced mutual fund indices and stylebased analytical tools to assist in evaluating fund portfolio characteristics and their performance finally in response to growing investor demand for expanded credit opinion in the high yield market moody’s has announced its intention to introduce both lossgivendefault and probabilityofdefault ratings 

additional opportunities in securitization 

the repackaging of financial assets has had a profound effect on the fixedincome markets new patterns of securitization are expected to emerge in the next decade although the bulk of assets securitized in the past five years have been consumer assets owned by banks commercial assets — principally commercial mortgages term receivables and corporate obligations — are now increasingly being securitized securitization has evolved into a strategic corporate finance tool in north america europe and japan and is evolving elsewhere internationally ongoing global development of nontraditional financial instruments such as credit derivatives future flow securities hybrids creditlinked bonds and catastrophe bonds should continue to support growth moody’s has introduced new services enabling investors to monitor the performance of their investments in structured finance covering assetbacked finance commercial mortgage finance residential mortgage finance and credit derivatives 

internetenhanced products and services 

moody’s is expanding its use of the internet and other electronic media to enhance client service moody’s website provides the public with instant access to ratings and provides the public and subscribers with credit research internet delivery also enables moody’s to provide services to more individuals within a client organization than were available with paperbased products and to offer highervalue services because of more timely delivery moody’s expects that access to these applications will increase client use of moody’s services moody’s expects to continue to invest in electronic media to capitalize on these and other opportunities 

  

expansion of credit research products and investment analytic tools 

moody’s plans to expand its research and analytic services through internal development and by acquisition to respond to client demand new product initiatives are more analytic and dataintensive than traditional research offerings such services address investor interest in replicating the monitoring activities conducted by for example moody’s securitization analysts and provide the means for customers to gain access to raw data and proprietary ratios used by moody’s analysts in the rating process for municipalities companies and financial institutions these products represent important sources of growth for the research business unit moreover moody’s continues to explore opportunities to extend its relevance in new domestic or regional markets eg china as well as new functional markets eg hedge funds 

new quantitative credit risk assessment services 

moody’s will continue to provide banks and other financial institutions with quantitative credit risk assessment services moody’s believes that there will be increased demand for such services because they enable customers trading or holding creditsensitive assets to produce better performance also recent proposals by international bank regulatory authorities to recognize banks’ internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining regulatory capital are expected to encourage adoption of such services moody’s also expects to provide extensions to existing services and new services such as valuations of creditsensitive assets 

regulation 

in the united states moody’s investors service has been designated as a nrsro by the sec the sec first applied the nrsro designation in 1975 to companies whose credit ratings could be used by brokerdealers for purposes of determining their net capital requirements since that time congress including in certain mortgagerelated legislation the sec including in certain of its regulations under the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and the investment company act of 1940 as amended and other governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of nrsros to distinguish between among other things “investment grade” and “noninvestment grade” securities moody’s investors service also voluntarily registers with the sec as a nrsro under the investment advisers act of 1940 as amended 

over the past several years us regulatory and congressional authorities have questioned the suitability of continuing to use ratings in federal securities laws and if such use is continued the potential need for altering the regulatory framework under which rating agencies operate following is a summary of some recent developments in the us 

in february 2005 moody’s participated in a hearing held by the united states senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs the “banking committee” on examining the role of credit rating agencies in the capital markets primary areas of inquiry by senators on the banking committee included i potential conflicts of interest affecting credit rating agencies and how those conflicts can be avoided or properly managed and ii the degree of competition in the credit ratings industry and how competition might be increased moody’s written statement submitted to the committee can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website at wwwmoodyscom the banking committee has scheduled another hearing for march 7 2006 

in march 2005 the sec disclosed that in considering the oversight of nrsros it may pursue a voluntary compliance and oversight framework for rating agencies that are designated as nrsros or it could seek legislative authority for formal oversight of nrsros moody’s continues to cooperate with the sec in its efforts to develop the voluntary framework with the nrsros 

in april 2005 the sec released for public comment a proposed rule on the “definition of nationally recognized statistical rating organization” the proposed definition of the term nrsro is an entity that i issues publicly available credit ratings that are current assessments of the creditworthiness of obligors with 

  

respect to specific securities or money market instruments ii is generally accepted in the financial markets as an issuer of credible and reliable ratings including ratings for a particular industry or geographic segment by the predominant users of securities ratings and iii uses systematic procedures designed to ensure credible and reliable ratings manage potential conflicts of interest and prevent the misuse of nonpublic information and has sufficient financial resources to ensure compliance with those procedures numerous market participants including moody’s responded to the request for comment moody’s response can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

in addition in june 2005 the sec produced technical assistance pursuant to a congressional request relating to statutory authority that the sec may need if congress determines that it is appropriate to create a comprehensive oversight regime for credit rating agencies congress had also requested that market participants provide their views on the sec’s technical assistance moody’s comments can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

in june 2005 us house representative michael fitzpatrick rpa introduced hr 2990 the “credit rating agency duopoly relief act of 2005” the house of representatives’ financial services subcommittee on capital markets held hearings on hr 2990 in june and november 2005 at which several interested parties testified representative michael oxley roh chair of the house of representatives’ financial services committee has indicated his intention to advance hr 2990 during 2006 the next steps in the process have not yet been announced 

at present moody’s is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory or legislative changes that may result from ongoing reviews in the united states nor the nature and effect of any such regulatory changes 

internationally several regulatory developments have occurred 

iosco — in december 2004 the technical committee of the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” published the code of conduct fundamentals for credit rating agencies the “iosco code” the iosco code is the product of approximately two years of collaboration among iosco rating agencies and market participants and incorporates provisions that address three broad areas 

Ÿ the quality and integrity of the rating process 

• credit rating agency independence and the avoidance of conflicts of interest and 

• credit rating agency responsibilities to the investing public and issuers 

the iosco code is not binding on credit rating agencies it relies on voluntary compliance and public disclosure of areas of noncompliance by credit rating agencies so that users of credit ratings can better assess rating agency behavior and performance moody’s endorsed the iosco code and in june 2005 published its code of professional conduct the “moody’s code” pursuant to the iosco code the moody’s code can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

european commission — in january 2006 the european commission “commission” produced for the european parliament a “communication on credit rating agencies” the “communication” the communication was in response to a february 2004 parliament resolution asking the commission to assess the need for legislative initiatives related to rating agencies in the communication the commission concluded that at present no additional legislation is required the commission noted that recent european union “eu” financial services legislative measures that are relevant to credit rating agencies combined with a selfregulatory framework for rating agencies based on the iosco code can effectively address the major concerns raised by the european parliament in addition the commission indicated that it will ask the committee of european securities regulators “cesr” to monitor rating agencies’ compliance with the iosco code and report back 

  

regularly the commission also stated that it will monitor developments related to rating agencies and that it could in the future reevaluate its approach or take legislative action 

moody’s cannot predict whether the european parliament will agree with the commission’s conclusion or whether regulation or legislation relating to rating agencies will be enacted in the eu 

european union market abuse directive — in 2003 the eu adopted the market abuse directive the “directive” which provides a common european framework for the prohibition of insider dealing and market manipulation and promotes market integrity by ensuring prompt and fair disclosure of information about financial instruments to the public the eu countries are currently adopting legislation that implements the directive while the directive is applicable to all participants in the european capital markets the eu has excluded credit rating agencies from certain of its rules that specifically address the type and amount of information that should be disclosed to the market depending on how each eu country adopts the directive it could among other things alter rating agencies’ communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process and increase moody’s cost of doing business in europe and the legal risk associated with such business 

the basel committee — in june 2004 the basel committee on banking supervision published its new capital adequacy framework “basel ii” to replace its initial 1988 framework under basel ii ratings assigned by recognized credit rating agencies called external credit assessment institutions or “ecais” would be an alternative available to banks to determine credit risk weights for many of their institutional credit exposures recognized ecais could be subject to a broader range of oversight it is anticipated that basel ii will be implemented by national regulatory authorities by january 2007 

in the eu basel ii has been adopted through the capital requirements directive “crd” which among other things set out criteria for recognizing ecais within the eu the commission created the committee of european banking supervisors “cebs” comprised of european banking regulators to advise it on banking policy issues that include implementing the crd in january 2006 cebs published “guidelines for a common approach to the recognition of external credit assessment institutions” the guidelines provide the basis for a consistent approach to the implementation of the crd’s ecai recognition and supervision criteria and cebs expects that national regulators in eu member states will apply the guidelines 

at this time moody’s cannot predict the longterm impact of basel ii on the manner in which the company conducts its business however moody’s does not currently believe that basel ii will materially affect its financial position or results of operations 

finally moody’s is subject to regulation in certain nonus jurisdictions in which it operates some recent regulatory actions outside the united states are noted below 

italy — in implementing the market abuse directive italy passed two laws during 2005 that were relevant to rating agencies — the eu law 2004 and the reform of savings law the eu law 2004 stated that certain provisions of the market abuse directive related to fair disclosure of information about financial instruments to the public were applicable to credit opinions published in the italian market although the european commission had explicitly excluded rating agencies from those provisions the reform of savings law amended the eu law 2004 and excluded rating agencies from the fair disclosure provisions the eu law 2004 had also directed the commissione nazionale per la società e la borsa “consob” to implement an appropriate regulatory framework to supervise rating agency conduct in italy consob adopted regulations in november 2005 that require rating agencies to adopt measures related to disclosure of information about financial instruments and to disclose whether such measures differ from those articulated in the iosco code 

other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services has been considered from time to time by local national and multinational bodies and is likely to be considered in the future in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies in addition governments 

  

may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could significantly change the competitive landscape in which moody’s operates in addition the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of moody’s cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occur moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets 

approximately 80 of moody’s revenue in 2005 was derived from ratings a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of creditsensitive securities in the global capital markets moody’s revenue growth from these sources in 2005 was in line with its compound annual growth rate from 2001 through 2004 as continued strength in global structured finance strong financial institutions issuance and ratings of bank credit facilities was partially offset by the impacts of declines in us high yield issues and in investment grade corporate finance issuance volumes in the us and europe the company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets therefore the company’s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance 

unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which moody’s provides ratings services in addition increases in interest rates or credit spreads volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment significant political or economic events defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers andor the types of creditsensitive products being offered a sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse effect on moody’s business and financial results 

possible loss of market share or revenue through competition or regulation 

the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive moody’s competes on the basis of a number of factors including quality of ratings client service research reputation regulatory qualification price geographic scope range of products and technological innovation for example a large investment grade default could impact the company’s reputation and potentially lead to greater regulatory oversight moody’s faces increasing competition from sp fitch dbrs local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company inc with respect to the insurance industry since moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the us it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions that moody’s does not receive 

currently moody’s sp fitch dbrs and am best company inc are designated as nrsros by the sec in march 2005 the sec disclosed that in considering the oversight of nrsros it may pursue a voluntary compliance and oversight framework for rating agencies that are designated as nrsros or it could seek legislative authority for formal compliance and oversight for nrsros 

in april 2005 the sec released for public comment a proposed rule on the “definition of nationally recognized statistical rating organization” the proposed definition of the term nrsro is an entity that i issues publicly available credit ratings that are current assessments of the creditworthiness of obligors with respect to specific securities or money market instruments ii is generally accepted in the financial markets as an issuer of credible and reliable ratings including ratings for a particular industry or geographic segment by the predominant users of securities ratings and iii uses systematic procedures designed to ensure credible and 

  

reliable ratings manage potential conflicts of interest and prevent the misuse of nonpublic information and has sufficient financial resources to ensure compliance with those procedures numerous market participants including moody’s responded to the request for comment moody’s response can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

in addition in june 2005 the sec produced technical assistance pursuant to a congressional request relating to statutory authority that the sec may need if congress determines that it is appropriate to create a comprehensive oversight regime for credit rating agencies congress had also requested that market participants provide their views on the sec’s technical assistance moody’s comments can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company’s website 

at present moody’s is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec’s ongoing review however the elimination of the nrsro concept retention of the nrsro concept with different regulatory oversight or sec recognition of additional nrsros could result in loss of market share or revenue for moody’s or higher costs of operations 

introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies 

the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and to utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s 

increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers 

in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service while moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and service if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors moody’s may lose market share 

possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures 

moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis moody’s ability to compete effectively will continue to depend among other things on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees 

exposure to litigation related to moody’s rating opinions 

moody’s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions in addition as moody’s international business expands these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the first amendment these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time 

  

potential emergence of governmentsponsored credit rating agencies 

when governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected governmentmandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness in these circumstances debt issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating which may negatively affect the company 

potential for new us foreign state and local legislation and regulations including those relating to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 

in the united states and other countries the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and are presently subject to review by a number of legislative or regulatory bodies including the sec in the united states and the cesr on behalf of the european union it is possible that such reviews could lead to greater oversight or regulation concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies such additional regulations could potentially increase the costs associated with the operation of a credit rating agency alter the rating agencies’ communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings change the regulatory framework to which credit rating agencies are subject andor affect the competitive environment in which credit rating agencies operate a description of certain of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the united states and other countries is described above under the section entitled “regulation” in item 1 “business” of this form 10k at present moody’s is unable to predict the regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the sec or other regulatory bodies or the effect that any such changes may have on its business 

exposure to increased risk from multinational operations 

moody’s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the us operations in different countries expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations of the company in the future

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation that are incidental to the company’s business including claims based on ratings assigned by moody’s moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business management periodically assesses the company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings other than routine litigation incidental to moody’s business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate for those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company has recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate in other instances because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moody’s corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” on page 39 and item 1a “risk factors” commencing on page 13 for a discussion of uncertainties risks and other factors associated with these statements 

the company 

except where otherwise indicated the terms “moody’s” and the “company” refer to moody’s corporation and its subsidiaries moody’s is a provider of i credit ratings research and analysis covering fixed income securities other debt instruments and the entities that issue such instruments in the global capital markets and credit training services and ii quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks corporations and investors in creditsensitive assets moody’s operates in two reportable segments moody’s investors service and moody’s kmv 

moody’s investors service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets including various corporate and governmental obligations structured finance securities and commercial paper programs it also publishes investororiented credit research including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies special comments and credit opinion handbooks 

the moody’s kmv business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks corporations and investors in creditsensitive assets 

the company operated as part of the dun  bradstreet corporation “old db” until september 30 2000 the “distribution date” when old db separated into two publicly traded companies — moody’s corporation and the new db corporation “new db” at that time old db distributed to its shareholders shares of new db stock new db comprised the business of old db’s dun  bradstreet operating company the “db business” the remaining business of old db consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services the “moody’s business” and was renamed “moody’s corporation” the method by which old db distributed to its shareholders its shares of new db stock is hereinafter referred to as the “2000 distribution” 

critical accounting estimates 

moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets pension and other postretirement benefits and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

  

revenue recognition 

in recognizing revenue related to ratings moody’s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods in such cases the company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods 

the portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors including the fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers the estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities currently the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years at december 31 2005 and 2004 deferred revenue included approximately 35 million and 30 million respectively related to such deferred monitoring fees 

additionally in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities currently the estimated monitoring period is 26 years at december 31 2005 and 2004 deferred revenue related to commercial mortgagebacked securities was approximately 50 million and 37 million respectively 

moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2005 and 2004 accounts receivable included approximately 31 million and 29 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically the company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 

accounts receivable allowance 

moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance adjustments to and writeoffs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its reviews moody’s establishes or adjusts allowances as considered appropriate this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the abovenoted factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in allowances that are greater or less than moody’s estimates in each of 2005 and 2004 the company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance 

contingencies 

accounting for contingencies including those matters described in the “contingencies” section of this management’s discussion and analysis is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial 

  

statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate  the company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may in the future adjust the provisions made in respect thereof since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the company has reserved their resolution could have a material adverse effect on moody’s future reported results and financial position in addition potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material 

for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 the provision for income taxes reflected credits of 88 million and charges of 300 million due to changes in the company’s reserves respectively for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by moody’s in connection with its separation from old db in october 2000 these tax matters are discussed under “legacy tax matters” below 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” moody’s also reviewed the mkmv trade secret for impairment which was reclassified as a finitelived asset beginning in december 2005 the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and the mkmv trade secret requires that the company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates in estimating future operating results and cash flows moody’s considers internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates and the effects of external factors and market conditions if actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the company’s judgments or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and the mkmv trade secret which charge could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the expenses assets liabilities and obligations that moody’s reports for pension and other postretirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these assumptions include the following 

 

  

  

  

 the discount rate selected to measure the present value of the company’s benefit obligations as of december 31 2005 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares the plans’ projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve the cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined 

  

moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in determining these assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s pension and other postretirement benefits when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used actuarial gains or losses arise which are amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants total unrecognized actuarial losses for pension plans as of december 31 2005 were 528 million and the company expects to recognize approximately 33 million of such losses in the company’s 2006 net periodic pension expense 

differences between the expected longterm rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense the company recognizes these differences over five years as of december 31 2005 the company has unrecognized plan asset gains of 04 million and the recognition of such gains is not expected to have a material impact on future net periodic pension expense 

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentagepoint decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2006 operating income dollars in millions these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2006 assets liabilities obligations and expenses related to pension and other postretirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available 

 

  discount rates of 560 and 545 are used for pension plans and other postretirement plans respectively 

a one percentagepoint increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have affected 2006 operating income based on current projections the company estimates that expenses related to pension and postretirement plans will be approximately 147 million in 2006 compared with 123 million excluding a 32 million settlement loss in 2005 the expected expense increase in 2006 reflects the effects of lower discount rates normal growth in plan liabilities the amendment to the company’s healthcare plan to increase moody’s share of future costs higher compensation for the supplemental executive benefit plan participants as well as amortization of actuarial losses 

stockbased compensation 

on january 1 2003 the company adopted on a prospective basis the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure — an amendment of fasb statement no 123” therefore employee stock options granted on and after january 1 2003 are being expensed by the company over the current fouryear option vesting period or sooner if employees are at or near retirement eligibility based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant the estimated fair value is calculated based on a blackscholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company which is limited the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 

  

an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2005 dollars in millions 

 

 other estimates 

in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated dividend distributions from nonus subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition

in addition the company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses products services and technologies the company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to new db its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under “contingencies” these potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements and they could cause the company to pursue additional financing there can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company if at all 

indebtedness 

on september 30 2005 the company entered into a note purchase agreement and issued and sold through a private placement transaction 300 million aggregate principal amount of its series 20051 senior unsecured notes “notes” the notes have a tenyear term and bear interest at an annual rate of 498 payable semiannually on march 30 and september 30 the proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to refinance 300 million aggregate principal amount of the company’s outstanding 761 senior notes “old notes” which matured on september 30 2005 in the event that moody’s pays all or part of the notes in advance of their maturity the “prepaid principal” such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess if any of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments as defined in the agreement over the prepaid principal 

on september 1 2004 moody’s entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured bank revolving credit facility the “facility” in an aggregate principal amount of 160 million that expires in september 2009 this facility replaced the 80 million fiveyear facility that was scheduled to expire in september 2005 and the 80 million 364day facility that expired in september 2004 interest on borrowings under the facility is payable at rates that are based on the london interbank offered rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 475 basis points depending on the company’s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “earnings coverage ratio” as defined in the related agreement at december 31 2005 such premium was 17 basis points the company also pays quarterly facility fees regardless of borrowing activity under the facility the quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the facility amount to 15 basis points depending on the company’s earnings coverage ratio and were 8 basis points at december 31 2005 under the facility the company also pays a utilization fee of 125 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the facility exceeds 50 of the facility 

management may consider pursuing additional longterm financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities which would result in higher financing costs 

the notes and the facility the “agreements” contain covenants that among other things restrict the ability of the company and certain of its subsidiaries without the approval of the lenders to engage in mergers consolidations asset sales transactions with affiliates and saleleaseback transactions or to incur liens as defined in the related agreements the facility also contains financial covenants that among other things require the company to maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and an earnings coverage ratio as defined in the agreement of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter at december 31 2005 the company was in compliance with 

  

such covenants upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the agreements all loans outstanding under the agreements including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the agreements may be terminated in addition certain other events of default under the agreements would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2005 and 2004 moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where moody’s is the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such moody’s is not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents payments due under the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 

 

   

 2006 outlook 

moody’s outlook for 2006 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates corporate profitability and business investment spending merger and acquisition activity consumer spending residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity securitization levels and capital markets issuance there is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions moody’s results for the year may differ from the current outlook 

for moody’s overall the company projects revenue growth in the high singledigit to doubledigit percent range for the full year 2006 including a small negative impact from foreign currency translation moody’s expects the operating margin after the impact of expensing stockbased compensation to decline by up to 150 basis points in 2006 compared with 2005 this reflects investments the company is continuing to make to expand internationally improve analytical processes pursue ratings transparency and compliance initiatives introduce new products and improve technology infrastructure 

for 2006 moody’s projects yearoveryear growth in gaap diluted earnings per share in the high singledigit to doubledigit percent range this expected growth includes the impact of reserve adjustments related to legacy tax matters in 2005 and the expensing of stockbased compensation in both 2005 and 2006 2006 represents the final 

  

year of “phasing” for stockbased compensation which began in 2003 the impact of expensing stockbased compensation is expected to be in the range of 012  014 per diluted share in 2006 compared to 010 per diluted share in 2005 

in the us the company is forecasting midsingledigit percent revenue growth for the moody’s investors service ratings and research business unit for the full year 2006 in the us structured finance business moody’s expects revenue for the year to rise modestly from the record level of 2005 the company is projecting a highteens percent decline from 2005 to 2006 in revenue from residential mortgagebacked securities including home equity securitization and notes a divergence in market views about the 2006 outlook for this business offsetting this expected decline moody’s looks for doubledigit yearoveryear growth in assetbacked securities credit derivatives and commercial mortgagebacked securities 

in the us corporate finance business the company believes that modest growth in investment grade issuance gains in rated share of the syndicated bank loan market and incremental revenue from the enhanced analysis initiative and new products will more than offset expected flat issuance in the speculative grade bond sector overall moody’s expects revenue in the us corporate finance business to grow in the low doubledigit percent range for the year 

in the us financial institutions sector the company projects issuance by banks to increase slightly in 2006 compared with 2005 and issuance by insurers and other financial institutions to be flat or down however fee increases partly related to the enhanced analysis initiative as well as expected new ratings mandates should produce revenue growth for the year in the low doubledigit percent range 

for the us public finance sector moody’s believes that rising interest rates will slow refinancing activity and result in lower issuance in 2006 than 2005 the company forecasts revenue for 2006 declining in the midsingledigit percent range from the prior year moody’s forecasts strong growth in the us research business unit at about twenty percent 

outside the us the company expects ratings revenue to grow in the lowteens percent range with high singledigit to midteens percent growth in all major business lines this forecast assumes that foreign currency translation rates will have a modest negative impact on revenue growth for the year in addition the outlook assumes low and midteens percentage growth in corporate revenue in europe and asia respectively for the financial institutions business moody’s expects to see high singledigit revenue growth in europe after a year of very strong issuance in 2005 and low doubledigit percent growth in asia the company looks for low teens percentage growth in international structured finance and about twenty percent growth in international research revenue 

for moody’s kmv globally the company expects moderate growth in net sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products credit decision processing software and professional services this should result in mid to highsingledigit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability 

contingencies 

from time to time moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation that are incidental to the company’s business including claims based on ratings assigned by moody’s moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business management periodically assesses the company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings other than routine litigation incidental to moody’s business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate for those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company has recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate in other instances because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 

  

based on its review of the latest information available in the opinion of management the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on moody’s financial position results of operations or cash flows subject to the contingencies described below 

legacy contingencies 

moody’s has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 distribution these contingencies are referred to by moody’s as “legacy contingencies” 

information resources inc 

an antitrust lawsuit was filed in 1996 by information resources inc “iri” a detailed description of this lawsuit was contained in reports previously filed by the company with the sec as previously disclosed vnu nv a publicly traded dutch company and its us subsidiaries vnu inc acnielsen corporation ac nielsen us inc and nielsen media research inc “nmr” collectively the “vnu parties” had assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit under the terms of the july 30 2004 amended indemnity and joint defense agreement as a result of the indemnity obligation moody’s did not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the vnu parties defaulted on their obligations however in the event of such a default contractual commitments undertaken by moody’s in connection with various corporate reorganizations since 1996 would have required the company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the vnu parties 

on february 16 2006 the parties to this action signed a settlement agreement pursuant to which the action will be dismissed with prejudice and releases from liability will be exchanged among the parties such releases will also include the company although not a defendant in the litigation as a releasee any amounts payable to the plaintiffs in connection with the settlement will be paid by the vnu parties and the company will not be required to contribute any amounts to the settlement payment the dismissal of the lawsuit is subject to court approval and the releases are being held in escrow pending such approval 

legacy tax matters 

old db and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business including through taxfree restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 

pursuant to a series of agreements as between themselves ims health and nmr are jointly and severally liable to pay onehalf and new db and moody’s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half of any payments for taxes penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable internal revenue service “irs” rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements excluding the matter described below as “amortization expense deductions” for which new db and moody’s are solely responsible and certain other potential tax liabilities also as described in such agreements after new db andor moody’s pays the first 137 million which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as “utilization of capital losses” 

in connection with the 2000 distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement new db and moody’s have between themselves agreed to each be financially responsible for 50 of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations 

without limiting the generality of the foregoing three specific tax matters are discussed below 

royalty expense deductions 

during the second quarter of 2003 new db received an examination report from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993 in this examination report the irs stated its intention to disallow 

  

certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old db on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 the “royalty report” in the first quarter of 2004 new db received a similar examination report the “second royalty report” relating to the first quarter of 1997 

during the second quarter of 2003 new db also received an examination report that had been issued by the irs to the partnership stating the irs’ intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction and to reallocate to old db income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 the “reallocation report” new db also received a similar examination report the “second reallocation report” issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of 1997 

in june 2004 new db and the irs conducted a mediation of these issues at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the royalty report for 1995 and 1996 the reallocation report and certain tax refund claims made by old db related to 1995 and 1996 the irs reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by old db related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993 the settlement was withdrawn by the irs in november 2004 as a result of these events the company increased its reserves for this matter by 30 million in 2004 

in 2005 new db moody’s ims health and nmr executed a closing agreement with the irs reflecting terms originally agreed to in june 2004 

after executing the closing agreement ims health and nmr disagreed with new db’s calculation of each party’s share of the tax liability set forth in the agreement as a result new db and moody’s each increased its share of the assessment by 73 million to 355 million and moody’s paid approximately 34 million of this amount in october of 2005 these events resulted in a net reduction of tax expense of 115 million new db anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr to collect the incremental amounts new db and moody’s were obligated to pay to the irs on their behalf based upon the current understanding of the positions which new db and ims health may take the company believes it is likely that new db should prevail but moody’s cannot predict with certainty the outcome 

in addition the second royalty report and the second reallocation report which were not part of the closing agreement with the irs have not been resolved moody’s estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the irs for this matter is 01 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits in the fourth quarter of 2005 new db filed a protest with the irs appeals office concerning the irs’ denial of certain tax refunds owing old db for 1993 and 1994 

moody’s estimates that its remaining share of the potential liability for the royalty expense deductions matter could be up to 16 million after payment pursuant to the closing agreement which takes into consideration 1 the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the federal closing agreement and 2 the potential writeoff of receivables for which the company’s exposure could be up to 9 million as discussed above 

amortization expense deductions 

in april 2004 new db received examination reports the “april examination reports” from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction this transaction was entered into in 1997 and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of old db since 1997 these deductions could continue through 2012 in the april examination reports the irs stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by old db on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns new db disagrees with the position taken by the irs and can either 1 accept and pay the irs assessment 2 challenge the assessment in us tax court or 3 challenge the assessment in us district court or the us court of federal claims where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge irs audits of old db’s or new db’s tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar 

  

examination reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years described below in which case new db has the aforementioned three courses of action similar examination reports could result for tax years subsequent to 2002 

should any such payments be made by new db related to either the april examination reports or any potential examination reports for future years including years subsequent to the separation of moody’s from new db then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement moody’s would have to pay to new db its 50 share in addition should new db discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns moody’s would be required to repay to new db an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50 share of the related future tax benefits new db had paid the discounted value of 50 of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to moody’s at the distribution date moody’s estimates that the company’s current potential exposure could be up to 101 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits this exposure could increase by approximately 3 million to 6 million per year depending on actions that the irs may take and on whether new db continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns 

in the april examination reports the irs also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old db on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction in addition the irs stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to old db certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998 new db disagrees with the positions taken by the irs and can take any of the three courses of action described in the first paragraph of this “amortization expense deductions” section irs audits of old db’s or new db’s tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar examination reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years described below similar examination reports could result for years subsequent to 2002 should any such payments be made by new db related to either the april examination reports or any potential examination reports for future years then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement moody’s would have to pay to new db its 50 share of new db’s payments to the irs for the period from 1997 through the distribution date moody’s estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the irs for the potential disallowance of royalty expense deductions could be up to 135 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability 

new db had filed protests with the irs appeals office regarding the april examination reports in september 2004 the irs appeals office remanded the case to the irs examination office for further development of the issues new db has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office 

on may 6 2005 new db received a notice of proposed adjustment “notice” from the irs for the 19992002 tax years which 1 disallows amortization expense deductions allocated from the partnership to old db on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and to new db on its 2000 2001 and 2002 tax returns and 2 disallows certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old db on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and by new db on its 2000 2001 and 2002 tax returns on august 4 2005 new db received an examination report the “august examination report” from the irs disallowing certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old db on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and by new db on its 2000 2001 and 2002 tax returns consistent with the notice and in addition assessing a twenty percent penalty new db has filed a protest with the irs appeals office regarding the august examination report currently the company does not expect that the notice or the examination report will have a material impact on the legacy tax reserves and the potential future outlays related to legacy tax matters that are discussed below in “summary of moody’s exposure to three legacy tax matters” 

moody’s believes that the irs’ proposed assessments of tax against old db and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to old db are inconsistent with each other accordingly while it is possible that the irs could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions moody’s believes that it is unlikely that the irs will prevail on both 

  

utilization of capital losses 

in july 2004 new db and the irs reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by old db during 1989 and 1990 in december 2004 new db executed a formal settlement agreement new db received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of 2005 and is awaiting receipt of the third and final assessment moody’s paid its allocated share of the first two assessments consisting of cash payments of 128 million 81 million net of expected tax benefits and the utilization of a tax receivable of approximately 9 million moody’s remaining liability at december 31 2005 was approximately 03 million the amounts paid by moody’s included its share of approximately 4 million that moody’s and new db believe should have been paid by ims health and nmr but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of new db’s calculation of their respective shares of the payments if new db fails to resolve this dispute with ims health and nmr moody’s understands that new db anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against them moody’s believes that new db should prevail in its position but the company cannot predict with certainty the outcome in the first quarter of 2005 moody’s had increased its reserves by 27 million due to this disagreement 

summary of moody’s exposure to three legacy tax matters 

the company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances in doing so moody’s makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 

for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded an 88 million net reversal of reserves of which 27 million related to an increase for the utilization of capital losses matter and 115 million related to the reversal for the royalty expense deductions described above the company has recorded 58 million of interest expense related to its legacy tax reserves moody’s total net legacy tax reserves were 97 million consisting of 106 million of tax liabilities partially offset by the expected utilization of 9 million of tax receivables the 97 million of expected cash payments consists of 8 million of current liabilities reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the royalty expense deductions and utilization of capital losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months and 89 million of noncurrent liabilities 

it is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the company which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody’s future reported results financial position and cash flows although moody’s does not believe it is likely that the company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the irs potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as 252 million and could increase with time as described above in matters where moody’s believes the irs has taken inconsistent positions moody’s may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments however moody’s believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the irs would retain such duplicative payments 

dividends 

during 2005 the company paid a quarterly dividend of 00375 in the first quarter and 0055 in each of the three subsequent quarters per share of moody’s common stock resulting in dividends paid per share of 02025 during the year during 2004 and 2003 the company paid quarterly dividends of 00375 and 00225 per share respectively of moody’s common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of 015 and 009 respectively 

on december 13 2005 the board of directors of the company approved a quarterly dividend of 007 per share of moody’s common stock payable on march 10 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 20 2006 the continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above or at all is subject to the discretion of the board of directors

moody’s investors service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and their obligations issued in domestic and international markets including various corporate and governmental obligations structured finance securities and commercial paper programs it also publishes investororiented credit research including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies special comments and credit opinion handbooks moody’s credit ratings and research help investors analyze the credit risks associated with fixedincome securities such independent credit ratings and research also contribute to efficiencies in markets for other obligations such as insurance policies and derivative transactions by providing credible and independent assessments of credit risk moody’s provides ratings and credit research on governmental and commercial entities in approximately 100 countries moody’s global and increasingly diverse services are designed to increase market efficiency and may reduce transaction costs at the end of 2004 moody’s had provided credit ratings and analysis on more than 35 trillion in debt outstanding covering nearly 170000 securities including those of industrial corporations financial institutions governmental entities and structured finance issuers with more than 10000 corporate relationships globally and over 100000 public finance obligations issued in the us market  ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media including the internet and realtime information systems widely used by securities traders and investors beyond credit rating services for issuers moody’s provides research services data and analytic tools that are utilized by institutional investors and other credit and capital markets professionals moody’s services cover various segments of the debt capital markets and are sold to more than 2600 institutions worldwide within these institutions over 16500 users accessed moody’s research website wwwmoodyscom during calendar year 2004 in addition to these clients more than 135000 other individuals visited moody’s website to retrieve current ratings and other information made freely available to the public the moody’s kmv business consists of the combined businesses of kmv llc and kmv corporation “kmv” acquired in april 2002 and moody’s risk management services moody’s kmv is a provider of credit risk processing and credit risk management products for banks and investors in creditsensitive assets and serves over 1600 clients operating in over 80 countries including most of the world’s largest financial institutions moody’s kmv’s quantitative credit analysis tools include models that estimate the probability of default for over 26000 publicly traded firms globally updated daily in addition moody’s kmv’s riskcalc tm models extend the availability of these probabilities to privately held firms in many of the world’s economies moody’s kmv also offers services to value and improve the performance of creditsensitive portfolios other services include training in using credit risk analysis products and software products to assist financial institutions in commercial lending activities prospects for growth over recent decades global public and private fixedincome markets have grown significantly in terms of outstanding principal amount and types of securities while there is potential for periodic cyclical disruption in these developments moody’s believes that the overall trend and outlook remain favorable for continued secular growth in capital market activity worldwide in addition the securities being issued in the global fixedincome markets are becoming more complex moody’s expects that these trends will provide continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions these phenomena are especially apparent in europe where economic integration is driving increased use of public fixedincome markets for corporate financing activities and factors such as increased adoption and enabling regulation have driven growth in structured finance issuance technology such as the internet makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world this technology facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets issuers and investors are also more readily able to obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell many of which may be unfamiliar to them this availability of information promotes worldwide financial markets and a greater need for credible and globally comparable credit ratings as a result a number of new capital markets have emerged in addition more issuers and investors are accessing traditional capital markets 3 

another trend that is increasing the size of the world capital markets is the ongoing disintermediation of financial systems issuers are increasingly financing in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries are selling assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets structured finance securities markets for many types of assets have developed in many countries and are contributing to these trends the complexity of capital market instruments is also growing consequently assessing the credit risk of such instruments becomes more of a challenge for financial intermediaries and asset managers in the credit markets reliable thirdparty ratings and research increasingly supplement or substitute for traditional inhouse research as the scale geographic scope and complexity of financial markets grow growth in issuance of structured finance securities has generally been stronger than growth in corporate and financial institutions issuance and moody’s expects that trend to continue growth in structured finance has reflected increased adoption of structured finance as an acceptable financing mechanism regulatory changes that facilitate the use of structured finance and increases in consumer debt that forms collateral for structured securities rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of moody’s investors service therefore a substantial portion of moody’s revenue is dependent upon the volume and number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets that moody’s rates moody’s is therefore affected by the performance of and the prospects for the major world economies and by the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings subscriptionbased research and other areas are less dependent on or independent of the volume or number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets moody’s operations are also subject to various risks inherent in carrying on business internationally such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources however the formation of a new governmentsponsored regional or global rating agency would pose a risk to moody’s growth prospects management believes that the risk compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry is relatively low because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required legislative bodies and regulators in both the united states and europe continue to conduct regulatory reviews of credit rating agencies which may result in an increased number of competitors restrictions on certain business expansion activities by moody’s investors service or increased costs of doing business for moody’s at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities see “regulation” below growth in moody’s kmv is expected from increased adoption of quantitative credit management techniques and of integrated riskmanagement solutions by financial institutions globally and by corporations managing trade receivables increased use of credit models is expected under the forthcoming revised international bank regulatory regime known as “basel ii” that is anticipated to be implemented by national regulatory authorities by january 2007 moody’s kmv also expects to introduce new products 4 

competition the moody’s investors service business competes with other credit rating agencies and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research institutional investors also have inhouse credit research capabilities moody’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp’s in other markets the reverse is true another rating agency competitor of moody’s is fitch a subsidiary of fimalac sa although moody’s and sp are each larger than fitch competition is expected to increase one or more additional significant rating agencies also may emerge in the united states if the securities and exchange commission “sec” expands the number of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations “nrsro” in february 2003 the sec designated dominion bond rating service ltd of canada “dbrs” a nrsro and in march 2005 the sec designated am best company inc a nrsro competition may also emerge in developed markets outside the united states over the next few years for example in response to the growth in the european capital markets and in developing markets any such rating agencies that may emerge may receive support from local governments or other institutions over the last decade additional rating agencies have been established primarily in emerging markets and as a result of local capital market regulation regulators worldwide have perceived that credit ratings can further regulatory objectives for the development of public fixedincome securities markets the result of such regulatory activity has been the creation of a number of primarily national rating agencies in various countries certain of these regulatory efforts may have the unintended effect of producing less credible ratings over time attempts to standardize ratings systems or criteria may make all rating systems and agencies appear undifferentiated obscuring variations in the quality of the ratings providers in addition since moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the united states it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets financial regulators are reviewing their approach to supervision and are seeking comments on changes to the global regulatory framework bank regulators under the oversight of the basel committee on banking supervision have proposed using refined risk assessments as the basis for minimum capital requirements the proposed standardized approach relies on rating agency opinions while the proposed internal ratings based approach relies on systems and processes maintained by the regulated bank the increased regulatory focus on credit risk presents both opportunities and challenges for moody’s global demand for credit ratings and risk management services may rise but regulatory actions may result in a greater number of rating agencies andor additional regulation of moody’s and its competitors alternatively banking or securities market regulators could seek to reduce the use of ratings in regulations thereby reducing certain elements of demand for ratings or otherwise seek to control the analysis or business of rating agencies credit rating agencies such as moody’s also compete with other means of managing credit risk such as credit insurance competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk also may pose a competitive threat to moody’s moody’s kmv’s main competitors for quantitative measures of default risk include the riskmetrics group sp creditsights ri’s financial technology institute in japan and other smaller vendors other firms may compete in the future baker hill a privately held company is moody’s kmv’s main competitor in the software market to assist banks in their commercial lending activities moody’s kmv’s training products have two main competitors omega performance a privately held firm and risk management association formerly robert morris associates a trade association serving the financial services industry 5 

moody’s strategy moody’s intends to focus on the following opportunities expansion in financial centers moody’s serves its customers through its global network of offices and business affiliations moody’s currently maintains fullservice rating and marketing operations in financial centers including frankfurt hong kong london madrid milan new york paris singapore and tokyo moody’s expects that its global network will position it to benefit from the expansion of worldwide capital markets and thereby increase revenue moody’s also expects that the growth of its moody’s investors service business as a consequence of financial market integration in europe will continue moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures new rating products moody’s is pursuing numerous initiatives to expand credit ratings from public fixedincome securities markets to other sectors with credit risk exposures as the loan and capital markets converge moody’s expects to continue to expand its rating coverage of bank loans and project finance loans and securities moody’s has a committed effort to extend its credit opinion franchise to the global bank counterparty universe through ratings of emerging market banks including bank financial strength ratings and global local currency ratings insurance financial strength ratings in the property and casualty reinsurance and life insurance markets represent additional growth opportunities moody’s has also introduced issuer ratings for corporations not active in the debt markets for company ratings moody’s seeks to continue to add value by providing greater scope and depth of analysis of issues related to company creditworthiness including enhanced liquidity and cash flow analysis and evaluation of accounting corporate governance and risk transference issues moody’s has also introduced mutual fund indices and stylebased analytical tools to assist in evaluating fund portfolio characteristics and their performance additional opportunities in securitization the repackaging of financial assets has had a profound effect on the fixedincome markets new patterns of securitization are expected to emerge in the next decade although the bulk of assets securitized in the past five years have been consumer assets owned by banks commercial assets — principally commercial mortgages term receivables and corporate obligations — are now increasingly being securitized securitization has evolved into a strategic corporate finance tool in north america europe and japan and is evolving elsewhere internationally ongoing global development of nontraditional financial instruments such as derivatives future flow securities hybrids creditlinked bonds and catastrophe bonds should continue to support growth moody’s has introduced new services enabling investors to monitor the performance of their investments in structured finance covering assetbacked finance commercial mortgage finance residential mortgage finance and credit derivatives internetenhanced products and services moody’s is expanding its use of the internet and other electronic media to enhance client service moody’s website provides the public with instant access to ratings and provides subscribers with credit research internet delivery also enables moody’s to provide services to more individuals within a client organization than paperbased products and to offer highervalue services because of more timely delivery moody’s expects that access to these applications will increase client use of moody’s services moody’s expects to continue to invest in electronic media to capitalize on these and other opportunities expansion of credit research products and investment analytic tools moody’s plans to continue to expand its research and analytic services by offering additional tools through internal development and by acquisition recent initiatives that have been wellreceived by clients include new services providing analysis of default rates and default probabilities online facilities for retrieving current rating information on demand the company’s marketimplied ratings service which compares ratings with other measures for assessing credit risk and risk analytics and performance data in structured finance moody’s may develop services for other financial markets such as credit default swaps in 2005 the company plans to launch a new product which provides investor clients with access to financial ratios and peer group statistics for the united states banking sector finally the company is improving its capability to deliver its research to new customer segments by creating more targeted and customized research offerings and by licensing moody’s credit analysis and research for redistribution by third party providers 6 

new quantitative credit assessment services moody’s will continue to provide banks and other financial institutions with quantitative credit assessment services moody’s believes that there will be increased demand for such services because they enable customers trading or holding creditsensitive assets to produce better performance also recent proposals by international bank regulatory authorities to recognize banks’ internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining regulatory capital will encourage adoption of such services moody’s also expects to provide extensions to existing services and new services such as valuations of creditsensitive assets regulation in the united states moody’s investors service voluntarily registers as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of 1940 as amended moody’s has also been designated as a nrsro by the sec the sec first applied the nrsro designation in 1975 to agencies whose credit ratings could be used by brokerdealers for purposes of determining their net capital requirements since that time congress in certain mortgagerelated legislation the sec in certain of its regulations under the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and the investment company act of 1940 as amended and other governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of nrsros to distinguish between among other things “investment grade” and “noninvestment grade” securities over the past several years us regulatory and congressional authorities have questioned the suitability of continuing to employ ratings in federal securities laws and if so the potential need for altering the regulatory framework under which rating agencies operate pursuant to a mandate by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and to reports issued by the congress and the sec on the rating agency industry on june 4 2003 the sec published a concept release requesting comment on the following three broad questions    numerous market participants including moody’s responded to the request for comment moody’s response can be found on the company’s website at wwwmoodyscom in march 2005 the sec disclosed that it will seek public comment on proposed recognition criteria for rating agencies seeking designation as nrsros in addition the sec may pursue a voluntary compliance and oversight framework for rating agencies that are designated as nrsros or it could seek legislative authority for formal compliance and oversight for nrsros also on february 8 2005 moody’s participated in a hearing on examining the role of credit rating agencies in the capital markets held by the united states senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs the “banking committee” primary areas of inquiry by senators on the banking committee included i potential conflicts of interest affecting credit rating agencies and how those conflicts can be avoided or properly managed and ii the degree of competition in the credit ratings industry and how competition might be increased moody’s written statement submitted to the committee can also be found on the company’s website at present moody’s is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory or legislative changes that may result from the ongoing reviews nor the nature and effect of any such regulatory changes internationally several regulatory developments occurred in 2004 first on december 23 2004 the technical committee of the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” published the code of conduct fundamentals for credit rating agencies “iosco code” the iosco code is the product of approximately two years of deliberations and market consultation by iosco and incorporates numerous provisions which address three broad areas 7 

   the iosco code is not binding on the credit rating agencies it relies on voluntary compliance and public disclosure of areas of noncompliance by credit rating agencies so that users of credit ratings can better assess rating agency behavior and performance moody’s is not yet in a position to assess the impact of the iosco code however moody’s intends to modify its internal code of conduct to more closely reflect the provisions in the iosco code and thereafter to disclose on a periodic basis its adherence to the iosco code’s provisions second in july 2004 the european commission as requested by the european parliament mandated the committee of european securities regulators “cesr” to conduct a review of the credit rating agency industry and provide the commission with advice by april 1 2005 on the following four general areas     pursuant to its mandate on november 30 2004 the cesr published for public comment a consultation document about the credit ratings industry subjects addressed by the consultation paper included the competitive structure of the industry and competition issues registration of credit rating agencies potential barriers to entry and potential rules of conduct for the industry the consultation paper concluded with a discussion of six illustrative regulatory options concerning registration and rules of conduct for rating agencies the regulatory options posed by the consultation paper range from registration and monitoring of credit rating agencies by regulatory authorities to relying on market mechanisms to control rating agencies the cesr held an open hearing on january 14 2005 in which moody’s participated market participants were invited to offer their views on the need for regulation in the european market the deadline for written responses to cesr’s consultation paper was february 1 2005 moody’s written comments can be found on the company’s website third implementation guidelines proposed by the cesr under the european commission’s market abuse directive are applicable to all participants in the european capital markets credit rating agencies are excluded from control under the guidelines however depending on the form in which the implementation guidelines are ultimately adopted by national regulators or lawmakers such guidelines could include controls over credit rating agencies in some european union “eu” countries if so the guidelines could among other things alter rating agencies’ communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process and increase moody’s cost of doing business in europe and the legal risk associated with such business fourth the basel committee on banking supervision has completed its work on a new capital adequacy framework “basel ii” to replace its initial 1988 framework under basel ii ratings assigned by a credit rating agency would be an alternative available to banks to determine the risk weights for many of their credit exposures the basel committee’s new capital adequacy framework would allow ratings of certain credit rating agencies to be used as one alternative in the credit measurement processes of internationally active financial institutions and would subject rating agencies whose ratings are used for such purpose to a broader range of oversight it is anticipated that basel ii will be implemented by national regulatory authorities by january 2007 the european commission has created the committee of european banking supervisors “cebs” comprised of european banking regulators to advise it on the implementation of basel ii in europe at this time moody’s cannot predict the longterm impact of basel ii on the manner in which moody’s conducts its business however moody’s does not believe that basel ii will materially affect moody’s investors service’s financial position or results of operations either positively or negatively 8 

finally moody’s is subject to regulation in certain nonus jurisdictions in which it operates some regulatory actions outside the united states are noted below france as a consequence of the 2003 french securities law loi de sécurité financiére the “lsf” rating agencies operating in france are subject to a document retention obligation moreover the newly formed french regulatory authority l’autorité des marchés financiers “amf” is required to publish an annual report on the role of rating agencies their business ethics the transparency of their methods and the impact of their activity on issuers and the financial markets moody’s has submitted responses to a series of questions posed by the amf in accordance with its mandate the amf released its first report on the rating agency industry on january 26 2005 it concluded that while there was no evidence of wrongdoing or inappropriate behavior in the industry some sort of regulatory framework at the european level may be suitable for that the amf deferred to the cesr process italy in march 2005 the italian parliament is expected to pass the eu law 2004 which will implement the eu market abuse directive in italy the draft legislation makes the market abuse directive applicable to rating agencies in the italian market it requires 1 the italian securities regulator commissione nazionale per la società e la borsa “consob” to recognize and register rating agencies in the italian market 2 recognized rating agencies to adopt and implement the iosco code and 3 issuers of bonds in the italian market to attain ratings from recognized rating agencies if approved the draft legislation would require that consob provide the appropriate regulatory framework the italian senate however has attached to the draft legislation a resolution recommending that the italian government   at present moody’s is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory or legislative changes that may result in italy nor the nature and effect of any such regulatory changes other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services has been considered from time to time by local national and multinational bodies and is likely to be considered in the future in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies in addition governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could significantly change the competitive landscape in which moody’s operates in addition the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of moody’s cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s intellectual property moody’s and its affiliates own and control a variety of trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names copyrights patents databases and other intellectual property rights that in the aggregate are of material importance to moody’s business management of moody’s believes that each of the “moody’s” “moody’s kmv” and the “m circle logo” and related names marks and logos are of material importance to moody’s moody’s is licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others and similarly other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by moody’s moody’s considers its trademarks service marks databases software and other intellectual property to be proprietary and moody’s relies on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret patent nondisclosure and contractual safeguards for protection 9 

in 2002 moody’s formed two subsidiaries that hold some of its intellectual property the first mis quality management corp was formed to own manage protect enforce and license the trademarks of moody’s and its affiliates the second moody’s assurance company inc is a new york state “captive” insurance company that selfinsures moody’s against certain risks and owns moody’s ratings databases methodologies and related software and processes in addition to other assets in support of its insurance program the names of moody’s products and services referred to herein are trademarks service marks or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or licensed to moody’s or one or more of its subsidiaries employees as of december 31 2004 the number of fulltime equivalent employees of moody’s was approximately 2500 available information moody’s investor relations internet website is httpirmoodyscom under the “sec filings” tab at this website the company makes available free of charge its annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the sec executive officers of the registrant

revenue recognition in recognizing revenue related to ratings moody’s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods in such cases the company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods the portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer the estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities currently the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years at december 31 2004 and 2003 deferred revenue included approximately 30 million and 26 million respectively related to such deferred monitoring fees moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2004 and 2003 accounts receivable included approximately 29 million and 26 million respectively related to accrued commercial paper revenue historically the company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings accounts receivable allowance moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance adjustments to and writeoffs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its reviews moody’s establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole as considered appropriate this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the abovenoted factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in allowances that are greater or less than moody’s estimates in each of 2004 and 2003 the company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance contingencies accounting for contingencies including those matters described in the “contingencies” section of this management’s discussion and analysis is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate  the company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may in the future adjust the provisions made in respect thereof since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the company has reserved their resolution could have a material adverse effect on moody’s future reported results and financial position in addition potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material 16 

for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 the provision for income taxes reflected charges of 300 million and 162 million respectively to increase the company’s reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by moody’s in connection with its separation from the dun  bradstreet corporation in october 2000 these tax matters are discussed under “legacy tax matters” below goodwill moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” moody’s goodwill balance is material 1317 million at december 31 2004 and the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates in estimating future operating results and cash flows moody’s considers internal budgets and strategic plans expected longterm growth rates and the effects of external factors and market conditions if actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the company’s judgments or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which charge could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations pension and other postretirement benefits the expenses assets liabilities and obligations that moody’s reports for pension and other postretirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these assumptions include the following • future compensation increases based on the company’s longterm actual experience and future outlook • discount rates based on current yields on high grade corporate longterm bonds • longterm return on pension plan assets based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixedincome investments in determining such assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from the company’s assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s pension and other postretirement benefits the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody’s 2005 operating income dollars in millions these effects have been calculated using the company’s current projections of 2005 assets liabilities obligations and expenses related to pension and other postretirement plans which could change as updated data becomes available  

based on our current projections the company estimates that expenses related to pension and postretirement plans will be approximately 13 million in 2005 compared with 8 million in 2004 the expected expense increase in 2005 reflects the effects of normal growth in plan liabilities as well as amortization of actuarial losses due to differences between past actuarial assumptions and actual plan experience and assumption changes adopted as of december 31 2004 stockbased compensation on january 1 2003 the company adopted on a prospective basis the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure — an amendment of fasb statement no 123” therefore employee stock options granted on and after january 1 2003 are being expensed by the company over the option vesting period based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant the estimated fair value is calculated based on a blackscholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company which is limited the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2004 dollars in millions  

other estimates in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated distributions from nonus subsidiaries realizability of longlived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact moody’s operating segments prior to 2002 the company operated in one reportable business segment – ratings which accounted for approximately 90 of the company’s total revenue with the april 2002 acquisition of kmv and its combination with moody’s risk management services to form moody’s kmv moody’s now operates in two reportable business segments moody’s investors service and moody’s kmv accordingly in the second quarter of 2002 the 18

moody’s effective tax rate was 446 in 2003 compared to 442 in 2002 the 2003 effective tax rate included the impact of a 162 million increase in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by moody’s in connection with its separation from the dun  bradstreet corporation in october 2000 see contingencies – legacy tax matters below this charge accounted for a 250 basis point increase in the effective rate in 2003 this increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of continued operating growth in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than new york and tax benefits from the establishment of a new york captive insurance company during 2002 net income was 3639 million in 2003 an increase of 750 million or 260 from 2889 million in 2002 earnings per share were 244 basic and 239 diluted in 2003 compared with 188 basic and 183 diluted in 2002 segment results moody’s investors service revenue at moody’s investors service for 2003 was 11347 million up 1929 million or 205 from 9418 million in 2002 good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 22 million of reported revenue growth price increases also contributed to yeartoyear growth in reported revenue structured finance revenue was 4606 million for 2003 an increase of 763 million or 199 from 3843 million in 2002 approximately 48 million of this increase was in united states revenue which grew in the midteens percent range and 28 million was in international which grew in the low twenty percent range in the united states the residential mortgage and home equity loan sector contributed 15 million of revenue growth as low interest rates drove strong refinancing activity good growth was also achieved in revenue from ratings of asset backed securities reflecting yeartoyear growth of about 10 in issuance volumes particularly student loans and higher average prices due to more complex transactions revenue from ratings of credit derivatives also grew yeartoyear outside the united states european structured finance was the main growth driver contributing 24 million of yeartoyear revenue growth this principally reflected growth in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities foreign currency translation and price increases also contributed to yeartoyear growth in global structured finance revenue corporate finance revenue was 2788 million in 2003 up 511 million or 224 from 2277 million in 2002 revenue grew by 27 million in the united states where the number of speculative grade issues rose significantly yeartoyear due to refinancings and new issuers in addition the number of investment grade issuance transactions increased nearly 10 yeartoyear although dollar issuance declined us revenue growth was also derived from areas not related to public debt issuance such as syndicated bank loan ratings and relationshipbased fees in europe revenue grew by 19 million yeartoyear the dollar volume of issuance was up nearly 40 primarily due to refinancing activity as spreads tightened and new issuers accessing the market price increases also contributed to yeartoyear growth in global corporate finance revenue revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was 1812 million for 2003 an increase of 262 million or 169 from 1550 million for 2002 the yeartoyear growth was almost wholly due to europe where revenue growth exceeded 40 this reflected a substantial yeartoyear increase in issuance and the addition of new issuers in the us revenue was flat versus strong prior year comparisons price increases also contributed to global financial institutions revenue growth over the prior year public finance revenue of 872 million for 2003 was up 60 million or 74 from 812 million in 2002 dollar issuance in the municipal bond market grew 5 versus 2002 but issuance of shortterm notes declined yeartoyear refinancings represented approximately 34 of total dollar issuance in 2003 versus 33 in 2002 research revenue increased 333 million or 356 to 1269 million for 2003 compared with 936 million for 2002 revenue grew by 18 million in the us and 13 million in europe the strong performance was driven by 24 

growth in licensing of moody’s information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution sales of new products to existing clients and new clients foreign currency translation also contributed to yeartoyear growth in reported revenue moody’s investors service operating selling general and administrative expenses including corporate expenses were 4622 million in 2003 an increase of 765 million or 198 from 3857 million in 2002 compensation and benefits expense accounted for 52 million of the total expense growth this reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in europe and the global structured finance business as well as the specialist teams that support moody’s enhanced analysis initiative despite the increase in staffing incentive compensation decreased slightly yeartoyear due to lower growth in the company’s operating results in 2003 compared with 2002 other yeartoyear expense increases included 96 million related to the company’s change in accounting for stockbased compensation mainly related to stock options granted in february 2003 7 million for increased professional fees mainly for legal fees and technology consulting costs and 4 million related to rent occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion foreign currency translation also contributed to yeartoyear growth in reported expenses depreciation and amortization expense was 154 million in 2003 versus 127 million in 2002 the yeartoyear increase of 27 million principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003 moody’s investors service operating income of 6571 million in 2003 was up 1137 million or 209 from 5434 million in 2002 moody’s kmv the following table shows moody’s kmv reported results for 2003 compared with the reported results for 2002 the “reported comparisons” and compared with 2002 on a pro forma basis presented as if moody’s had acquired kmv on january 1 2002 the “pro forma comparisons” in a manner consistent with sfas no 141 and as further described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements the discussion of mkmv results of operations that follows is based on the pro forma comparisons  

mkmv’s pro forma yeartoyear revenue increase in 2003 principally reflected 12 million of growth in subscription revenue from credit risk assessment products including credit edge tm  riskcalc tm  and portfolio manager tm  revenue from license fees and maintenance related to credit processing software grew 2 million yeartoyear operating selling general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased slightly compared to pro forma 2002 expenses compensation and benefits expense was flat yeartoyear the impacts of compensation increases and higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business were offset by lower expenses for incentive compensation due to below target operating performance in 2003 whereas performance was above target in 2002 commission expense for third party distributors declined due to lower sales from this source in 2003 expenses in 2003 included 12 million related to the company’s change in accounting for stockbased compensation mainly for options granted in february 2003 pro forma depreciation and amortization expense reflected 88 million of amortization of acquired kmv software and intangible assets in each period the pro forma yeartoyear increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs 25

 2005 outlook moody’s outlook for the full year 2005 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates corporate profitability and business investment spending merger and acquisition activity consumer spending residential mortgage refinancing activity securitization levels and capital markets issuance there is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions moody’s results for the year may differ from the outlook presented below in the us the company expects midsingledigit percent revenue growth for the ratings and research business for the full year 2005 in the us structured finance market moody’s expects that revenue from rating residential mortgage and home equity securities will decline by approximately twenty percent or more in 2005 from the record level of 2004 the company expects good yearoveryear growth in several other sectors of us structured finance including assetbacked securities and credit derivatives  and flat to modest growth in assetbacked commercial paper and commercial mortgagebacked securities accordingly for the full year moody’s expects a modest decline in us structured finance revenue in the us corporate finance business the company expects that modest growth in investmentgrade issuance and bank loan ratings and revenue from our enhanced analysis initiative will offset relative weakness in speculativegrade bond activity resulting in high singledigit percent growth in revenue flat issuance volume in the financial institutions sector in the us is expected to be offset by revenue from the enhanced analysis initiative and new rating relationships allowing low doubledigit percent growth in this business in the us in 2005 moody’s expects a second consecutive year of modest yeartoyear revenue decline in us public finance the company is also forecasting continued strong growth in the us research business outside the us moody’s expects growth in ratings and research revenue in the range of 20 with doubledigit percent growth in all major business lines in almost all regions assisted by favorable foreign currency impacts the company’s projection assumes improved corporate issuance in europe after a relatively weak 2004 modest 29 

issuance growth in the financial institutions sector and growth in several sectors of structured finance in europe and japan in addition moody’s expects continued strong growth in international research revenue finally the company continues to expect global revenue to rise in the midteens percent range at moody’s kmv reflecting good growth in both credit risk assessment subscription products and credit processing software products for moody’s overall the company expects high singledigit percent revenue growth for the full year 2005 including the positive impact of currency translation moody’s expects the operating margin including the impact of expensing stockbased compensation to be down approximately 200 basis points in 2005 compared with 2004 this reflects slower revenue growth in 2005 than in 2004 and continued investments in expanding geographically improving analytic processes and pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives in the moody’s investors service business introducing new products and improving technology for 2005 the company expects that yearoveryear growth in diluted earnings per share will be in the midteens percent range this expected growth includes the impacts of the legacy tax provisions in 2004 and the expensing of stockbased compensation in 2004 and 2005 the impact of expensing stockbased compensation is expected to be in the range of 018 — 020 per diluted share in 2005 compared to 011 per diluted share in 2004 the estimated 2005 impact excludes any effects of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” which will be effective as of july 1 2005 and is more fully discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements additional factors that may affect future results the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occur moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets approximately 80 of moody’s revenue in 2004 was derived from ratings a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of creditsensitive securities in the global capital markets moody’s revenue growth from these sources in 2004 was lower than its growth in 2001 through 2003 as strong growth in global structured finance and financial institutions issuance and ratings of us highyield issues and bank credit facilities was partially offset by the impacts of declines in investment grade corporate finance issuance volumes in the us and europe the company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets therefore the company’s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which moody’s provides ratings services in addition increases in interest rates or credit spreads volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment significant political or economic events defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers andor the types of creditsensitive products being offered a sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse effect on moody’s business and financial results possible loss of market share or revenue through competition or regulation the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive moody’s competes on the basis of a number of factors including quality of ratings client service research reputation price 30 

geographic scope range of products and technological innovation moody’s faces increasing competition from sp fitch dbrs local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company in the insurance industry since moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the us it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions currently moody’s sp fitch dbrs and am best company inc are designated as nrsros by the sec on june 4 2003 the sec issued a concept release regarding the credit ratings industry wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas 1 should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws 2 if so what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use and 3 if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used numerous market participants including moody’s responded to the call for comment moody’s response can be found on the company’s website at wwwmoodyscom at present moody’s is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec’s ongoing review however the elimination of the nrsro concept retention of the nrsro concept with different regulatory oversight or sec recognition of additional nrsros could result in loss of market share or revenue for moody’s or higher costs of operations introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more costeffective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service moody’s intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets however if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors moody’s may lose market share possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis moody’s ability to effectively compete will continue to depend among other things on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees exposure to litigation related to moody’s rating opinions moody’s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions in addition as moody’s international business expands these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not 31 

have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the first amendment these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time potential emergence of governmentsponsored credit rating agencies when governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected governmentmandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness in these circumstances issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating which may negatively affect the company potential for new us foreign state and local legislation and regulations including those relating to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in the united states and other countries the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and are presently subject to review by a number of legislative or regulatory bodies including the sec in the united states and the cesr on behalf of the european union it is possible that such reviews could lead to greater oversight or regulation concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies such additional regulations could potentially increase the costs associated with the operation of a credit rating agency alter the rating agencies’ communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings change the regulatory framework to which credit rating agencies are subject andor affect the competitive environment in which credit rating agencies operate a description of certain of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the united states and other countries is described above under the section entitled “regulation” in item 1 “business” of this form 10k at present moody’s is unable to predict the regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the sec or other regulatory bodies or the effect that any such changes may have on its business 32 

multinational operations moody’s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the us operations in several different countries expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as          although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations of the company any of these factors could have such an effect in the future contingencies from time to time moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation that are incidental to the company’s business including claims based on ratings assigned by moody’s management periodically assesses the company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available for those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate in other instances because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability if any as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly based on its review of the latest information available in the opinion of management the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation will not have a material 33 

adverse effect on moody’s financial position results of operations or cash flows subject to the contingencies described below legacy contingencies to understand the company’s exposure to the potential liabilities described below it is important to understand the relationship between moody’s and new db and the relationship among new db and its predecessors and other parties who through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters in november 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation through a spinoff separated into three separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation acnielsen corporation “acnielsen” and cognizant corporation “cognizant” the “1996 distribution” under the terms of the distribution agreement relating to the 1996 distribution the “1996 distribution agreement” each party thereto is prohibited from distributing to its stockholders any business that had been allocated to it in connection with the 1996 distribution unless the distributed business delivers an undertaking agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 distribution agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 distribution agreement in june 1998 the dun  bradstreet corporation through a spinoff separated into two separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation and rh donnelley corporation “donnelley” the “1998 distribution” during 1998 cognizant through a spinoff separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated “ims health” and nielsen media research inc “nmr” in september 2000 the dun  bradstreet corporation “old db” through a spinoff separated into two separate public companies new db and moody’s as further described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements information resources inc the following is a description of an antitrust lawsuit filed in 1996 by information resources inc “iri” as more fully described below vnu nv a publicly traded dutch company and its us subsidiaries vnu inc acnielsen corporation “acnielsen” ac nielsen us inc “acn us” and nielsen media research inc “nmr” collectively the “vnu parties” have assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit as a result of the indemnity obligation moody’s does not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the vnu parties default on their obligations however in the event of such a default contractual commitments undertaken by moody’s in connection with various corporate reorganizations since 1996 would require the company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the vnu parties moreover as described below on february 1 2005 the us district court for the southern district of new york entered a final judgment against iri dismissing iri’s claims with prejudice and on the merits in july 1996 iri filed a complaint subsequently amended in 1997 in the us district court for the southern district of new york naming as defendants the corporation then known as the dun  bradstreet corporation now known as rh donnelly ac nielsen company a subsidiary of acnielsen and ims international inc a subsidiary of the company then known as cognizant at the time of the filing of the complaint each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of the company then known as the dun  bradstreet corporation the amended complaint alleges various violations of united states antitrust laws under sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act the amended complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship these claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of survey research group limited “srg” iri alleged srg violated an alleged agreement with iri when it agreed to be acquired by defendants and that defendants induced srg to breach that agreement iri’s antitrust claims allege that defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine iri’s ability to compete within the united states and foreign markets in north america latin america asia europe and 34 

australianew zealand through a series of anticompetitive practices including unlawfully tyingbundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which acnielsen competed with iri entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny iri’s access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data predatory pricing acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding iri’s efforts to expand disparaging iri to financial analysts and clients and denying iri access to capital necessary for it to compete iri is seeking in excess of 650 million which iri also asked to be trebled iri has filed with the court the report of its expert who has opined that iri suffered damages of between 582 million and 652 million from the defendants’ alleged practices iri also sought punitive damages in an unspecified amount on june 21 2004 pursuant to a stipulation between iri and defendants the court ordered that certain of iri’s claims be dismissed with prejudice from the lawsuit including the claims that defendants tortiously interfered with the srg acquisition the company believes that the dismissal of the tortious interference claims also precludes any claim for punitive damages on december 3 2004 the court entered in limine order no 1 which bars iri from “arguing that nielsen’s pricing practices or discounts were illegal or anticompetitive unless it can prove they involved prices below shortrun average variable cost calculated without the inclusion of nielsen’s ‘fixed operations’ costs” on december 17 2004 iri issued a press release which said in relevant part “without this evidence iri believes that little would be left of iri’s case to take to trial” iri asked the court to enter a final judgment against it so that it could take an immediate appeal to the court of appeals for the second circuit defendants did not object to this request on february 1 2005 the court entered a final judgment dismissing iri’s claims with prejudice and on february 2 2005 the court entered iri’s notice of appeal to the second circuit the court of appeals for the second circuit has ordered that the appeal be argued no earlier than the week of june 13 2005 in connection with the 1996 distribution nmr then known as cognizant corporation acnielsen and donnelley then known as the dun  bradstreet corporation entered into an indemnity and joint defense agreement the “original indemnity and joint defense agreement” pursuant to which they agreed to  in 2001 acnielsen was acquired by vnu nv which assumed acnielsen’s obligations under the original indemnity and joint defense agreement under the terms of the 1998 distribution old db assumed all potential liabilities of donnelley then known as the dun  bradstreet corporation arising from the iri action and agreed to indemnify donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities under the terms of the 2000 distribution new db undertook to be jointly and severally liable with moody’s for old db’s obligations to donnelley under the 1998 distribution including for any liabilities arising under the original indemnity and joint defense agreement and arising from the iri action itself however as between new db and moody’s it was agreed that under the 2000 distribution each of new db and moody’s will be responsible for 50 of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of donnelley with respect to the iri action under the terms of the 1998 distribution including legal fees or expenses related to the iri action on july 30 2004 the vnu parties donnelley moody’s new db and ims health entered into an amended and restated indemnity and joint defense agreement the “amended indemnity and joint defense agreement” pursuant to the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement any and all iri liabilities incurred by donnelley moody’s new db or ims health relating to a judgment even if not final or any settlement being entered into in the iri action will be jointly and severally assumed and fully discharged exclusively by the vnu parties under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement the vnu parties have agreed to jointly 35 

and severally indemnify donnelley moody’s new db and ims health from and against all iri liabilities to which they become subject as a result the cap on acnielsen’s liability for the iri liabilities which was provided for in the original indemnity and joint defense agreement no longer exists and all such liabilities are the responsibility of the vnu parties pursuant to the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement in addition the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment then the vnu parties shall obtain the bond required for the appeal and shall pay the full cost of such bond in connection with entering into the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement donnelley moody’s new db and ims health agreed to amend certain covenants of the original indemnity and joint defense agreement to provide operational flexibility for acnielsen going forward in addition the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement includes certain amendments to the covenants of acnielsen which under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement are now also applicable to acn us which the company understand holds acnielsen’s operating assets which are designed to preserve such parties’ claimspaying ability and protect donnelley moody’s new db and ims health among other covenants acnielsen and acn us agreed that neither they nor any of their respective subsidiaries will incur any indebtedness to any affiliated person except indebtedness which its payment will after a payment obligation under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement comes due be conditioned on and subordinated to the payment and performance of the obligations of such parties under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement vnu nv has agreed to having a process agent in new york to receive on its behalf service of any process concerning the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement as described above the vnu parties have assumed exclusive responsibility for the payment of all iri liabilities however because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because the rights and obligations relating to the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement are based on contractual relationships the failure of the vnu parties to fulfill their obligations under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement could result in the other parties bearing all or a portion of the iri liabilities joint and several liability for the iri action means that even where more than one defendant is determined to have been responsible for an alleged wrongdoing the plaintiff can collect all or part of the judgment from just one of the defendants this is true regardless of whatever contractual allocation of responsibility the defendants and any other indemnifying parties may have made including the allocations described above between the vnu parties donnelley moody’s new db and ims health accordingly and as a result of the allocations of liability described above in the event the vnu parties default on their obligations under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement each of moody’s and new db will be responsible for the payment of 50 of the portion of any judgment or settlement ultimately paid by donnelley which is a defendant in the iri action which can be as high as all the iri liabilities the company is unable to predict the outcome of the iri action including the appeal or the financial condition of any of the vnu parties or the other defendants at the time of any such outcome and hence the company cannot estimate their ability to pay the iri liabilities pursuant to the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement or the amount of the judgment or settlement in the iri action however provided that the vnu parties fulfill their obligations under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement the company believes that the resolution of this matter irrespective of the outcome of the iri action should not materially affect moody’s financial position results of operations and cash flows accordingly no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if however iri were to prevail in whole or in part in this action and if moody’s is required to pay notwithstanding such contractual obligations a portion of any significant settlement or judgment the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on moody’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 36 

legacy tax matters old db and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business including through taxfree restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities pursuant to a series of agreements as between themselves ims health and nmr are jointly and severally liable to pay onehalf and new db and moody’s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half of any payments for taxes penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable irs rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements excluding the matter described below as “amortization expense deductions” for which new db and moody’s are solely responsible and certain other potential tax liabilities also as described in such agreements after new db andor moody’s pays the first 137 million which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as “utilization of capital losses” in connection with the 2000 distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement new db and moody’s have between themselves agreed to each be financially responsible for 50 of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations without limiting the generality of the foregoing three specific tax matters are discussed below royalty expense deductions during the second quarter of 2003 new db received an examination report from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993 in this report the irs stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old db on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 the “royalty report” in the first quarter of 2004 new db received a similar examination report the “second royalty report” relating to the first quarter of 1997 during the second quarter of 2003 new db also received an examination report that had been issued by the irs to the partnership stating the irs’ intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction and to reallocate to old db income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 the “reallocation report” new db also received a similar examination report the “second reallocation report” issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of 1997 in june 2004 new db and the irs conducted a mediation of these issues at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the royalty report for 1995 and 1996 the reallocation report and certain tax refund claims made by old db related to 1995 and 1996 the “preliminary settlement” the preliminary settlement was subject to the execution of a formal settlement agreement in addition the irs reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by old db related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993 new db disagrees with the position taken by the irs for 1993 and 1994 and plans to file a protest with the irs appeals office if the protest is unsuccessful new db can either 1 abandon its tax refund claims or 2 challenge the irs claim in us district court or the us court of federal claims moody’s estimates that its exposure for the writeoff of deferred tax assets related to these tax refund claims could be up to 9 million as of june 30 2004 moody’s had adjusted its reserves for the royalty expense deductions matter to reflect the company’s estimates of probable exposure for the preliminary settlement and the other matters discussed in the preceding paragraph in accordance with the 1996 distribution agreement new db was required to obtain the consent of moody’s ims health and nmr as a condition to executing the formal settlement agreement but new db was unable to obtain consent from ims health and nmr accordingly new db and the irs were unable to agree on the terms of a formal settlement agreement by the november 1st deadline imposed by the irs as a result the irs withdrew the preliminary settlement 37 

the company believes that in accordance with the 1996 distribution agreement ims health and nmr by withholding their consent to the formal settlement agreement would be contractually responsible to pay any excess amounts above the preliminary settlement that may ultimately be owing with respect to tax years 1995 and 1996 ims health has alleged various breaches of new db’s obligations under the 1996 distribution agreement related to new db’s management and attempted settlement of this matter if the parties fail to resolve their dispute moody’s understands that new db anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr based on our current understanding of the positions of new db and ims health the company believes it is likely that new db should prevail but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome in addition the second royalty report and the second reallocation report which were not part of new db’s preliminary settlement with the irs have not been resolved moody’s estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the irs for this matter is 01 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits moody’s has reassessed its exposure for the royalty expense deductions matter taking into consideration 1 the original examination reports discussed above for which the company’s share of the required payments to the irs could be up to 103 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits and 2 the potential writeoff of deferred tax assets for which the company’s exposure could be up to 9 million as discussed above based on this assessment in 2004 the company increased its reserve for this matter by 164 million to reflect the current estimate of probable exposure moody’s believes that the positions taken by the irs in the royalty reports and the reallocation reports discussed above are inconsistent with each other while it is possible that the irs could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions noted above moody’s believes that it is unlikely that the irs will prevail on both amortization expense deductions in april 2004 new db received examination reports the “april examination reports” from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction this transaction was entered into in 1997 and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of old db since 1997 these deductions could continue through 2012 in the april examination reports the irs stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by old db on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns new db disagrees with the position taken by the irs and can either 1 accept and pay the irs assessment 2 challenge the assessment in us tax court or 3 challenge the assessment in us district court or the us court of federal claims where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge irs audits of old db’s or new db’s tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar examination reports in which case new db would also have the aforementioned three courses of action should any such payments be made by new db related to either the april examination reports or any potential examination reports for future years including years subsequent to the separation of moody’s from new db then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement moody’s would have to pay to new db its 50 share in addition should new db discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns moody’s would be required to repay to new db an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50 share of the related future tax benefits new db had paid the discounted value of 50 of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to moody’s at the distribution date moody’s estimates that the company’s current potential exposure could be up to 95 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits this exposure could increase by approximately 3 million to 6 million per year depending on actions that the irs may take and on whether new db continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns in the april examination reports the irs also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old db on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction in addition the irs stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to old db certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998 new db disagrees with the positions taken by the irs and can take any of the three courses of action described in the preceding paragraph irs audits of old db’s or new db’s tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar examination reports for the subsequent years should any such payments be made by new db related to either the april examination reports or any potential examination reports for future years then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement moody’s would have to pay to new db its 50 share of new db’s payments to the irs for the period from 1997 through the distribution date moody’s 38 

estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the irs could be up to 129 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability new db had filed protests with the irs appeals office regarding the april examination reports in september 2004 the irs appeals office remanded the case to the irs examination office for further development of the issues new db has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office moody’s believes that the irs’s proposed assessments of tax against old db and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to old db are inconsistent with each other accordingly while it is possible that the irs could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions moody’s believes that it is unlikely that the irs will prevail on both utilization of capital losses the irs has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated by old db during 1989 and 1990 on june 26 2000 the irs as part of its audit process issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses on may 12 2000 an amended tax return was filed by old db for the 1989 and 1990 tax years which reflected 5616 million of tax and interest due old db paid the irs approximately 3493 million of this amount on may 12 2000 50 of such payment was allocated to moody’s and had previously been accrued by the company ims health informed old db that it paid to the irs approximately 2123 million on may 17 2000 the payments were made to the irs to stop further interest from accruing and on september 20 2000 old db filed a petition for a refund in the us district court in july 2004 new db and the irs reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to this matter and in december 2004 executed a formal settlement agreement new db received the first of three final assessments on february 15 2005 and expects to receive the other two in the second quarter of 2005 payment of the first assessment was made in the first quarter of 2005 and payment of the two other assessments is expected to be made in the second quarter of 2005 moody’s estimates its share of these assessments to be approximately 15 million reflecting cash payments of approximately 6 million and the writeoff of deferred tax assets of approximately 9 million in addition ims health and nmr have notified new db that they disagree with various aspects of new db’s calculation of their respective shares of the payments if the parties fail to resolve their dispute moody’s understands that new db anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr moody’s believes that new db should prevail in its position but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome in 2004 moody’s increased its reserves for this matter by 14 million to reflect its current estimate of the probable exposure should ims health and nmr prevail in their position described in the prior paragraph then moody’s estimates that its exposure for this matter could increase by up to approximately 3 million summary of moody’s exposure to three legacy tax matters the company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances in doing so moody’s makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis during 2004  the company recorded charges of approximately 30 million to increase its reserves for the three legacy tax matters reflecting its current estimates of the probable exposures on these matters the company also recorded approximately 3 million of interest expense related to these reserves as a result at december 31 2004 moody’s total net legacy tax reserves were 136 million consisting of 161 million of tax liabilities partially offset by the expected utilization of 25 million of deferred tax assets the 136 million of expected cash payments consists of 50 million of current liabilities reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the royalty 39 

expense deductions and utilization of capital losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months and 86 million of noncurrent liabilities it is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the company which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody’s future reported results financial position and cash flows although moody’s does not believe it is likely that the company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the irs potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as 354 million and could increase with time as described above in matters where moody’s believes the irs has taken inconsistent positions moody’s may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments however moody’s believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the irs would retain such duplicative payments dividends during 2004 the company paid a quarterly dividend of 75 cents per share of moody’s common stock resulting in dividends paid per share of 30 cents during the year during 2003 and 2002 the company paid a quarterly dividend of 45 cents per share of moody’s common stock resulting in dividends paid per share of 18 cents in each year on december 14 2004 the board of directors of the company approved a quarterly dividend of 75 cents per share of moody’s common stock payable on march 10 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 20 2005 on february 15 2005 the board voted to increase the quarterly dividend per share to 011 before giving effect to the proposed twoforone stock split discussed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements payable on june 15 2005 to shareholders of record as of may 27 2005 if the stock split is effected then on a postsplit basis the dividend will be increased to 55 cents per share from the 375 cents per share that otherwise would have been paid absent the dividend increase the continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above or at all is subject to the discretion of the board of directors on february 15 2005 the board of directors declared a twoforone stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the company’s common stock outstanding and treasury shares stockholders of record as of the close of business on may 4 2005 will receive one additional share of common stock for each share of the company’s common stock held on that date such additional shares will be distributed on may 18 2005 the board of directors’ declaration of a special stock dividend distribution is subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the company’s authorized common shares moody’s stockholders will vote on the charter amendment at the company’s annual meeting which will be held on april 26 2005 the proposal to amend the company’s charter to increase the number of authorized shares will be more fully described in the company’s annual meeting proxy statement 40

probabilities to privately held firms in many of the world’s economies moody’s kmv also offers services to value and improve the performance of creditsensitive portfolios other services include credit training and software products to assist financial institutions in commercial lending activities prospects for growth over the past decade global public and private fixedincome markets have grown significantly in terms of outstanding principal amount and types of securities while there is potential for periodic cyclical disruption in these developments moody’s believes that the overall trend and outlook remain favorable for the continued growth in capital market activity worldwide in addition the securities being issued in the global fixedincome markets are becoming more complex moody’s expects that these trends will provide continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions these phenomena are especially apparent in europe where economic and monetary union is driving increased use of public fixedincome markets for corporate financing activities and factors such as increased adoption and enabling regulation have driven growth in structured finance issuance technology such as the internet makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world this technology facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets issuers and investors are also more readily able to obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell many of which may be unfamiliar to them this availability of information promotes worldwide financial markets and a greater need for credible and globally comparable credit ratings as a result a number of new capital markets have emerged in addition more issuers and investors are accessing traditional capital markets another trend that is increasing the size of the world capital markets is the ongoing disintermediation of financial systems issuers are increasingly financing in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries are selling assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets structured finance securities markets for many types of assets have developed in many countries and are contributing to these trends 4 

the complexity of capital market instruments is also growing consequently assessing the credit risk of such instruments becomes more of a challenge for financial intermediaries and asset managers in the credit markets reliable thirdparty ratings increasingly supplement or substitute for traditional inhouse research as the geographic scope and complexity of financial markets grow growth in issuance of structured finance securities has been stronger than growth in corporate and financial institutions issuance and moody’s expects that trend to continue growth in structured finance has reflected increased adoption of structured finance as an acceptable financing mechanism regulatory changes that facilitate the use of structured finance and increases in consumer debt that forms collateral for structured securities rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of moody’s investors service therefore a substantial portion of moody’s revenue is dependent upon the volume and number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets moody’s is therefore affected by the performance of and the prospects for the major world economies and by the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings subscriptionbased research and other areas are less dependent on or independent of the volume or number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets moody’s operations are also subject to various risks inherent in carrying on business internationally such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources nationalization in the form of a new governmentsponsored regional or global rating agency also poses a risk to moody’s growth prospects however management believes the risk is reduced because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry legislative bodies and regulators in both us and europe continue to conduct regulatory reviews of credit rating agencies which may result in an increased number of competitors restrictions on certain business expansion activities or increased costs of doing business for moody’s at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities see “regulation” below growth in moody’s kmv is expected from increased adoption of quantitative credit management techniques and of integrated riskmanagement solutions by financial institutions globally and by corporations managing trade receivables increased use of credit models is expected under the forthcoming revised international bank regulatory regime known as “basel ii” moody’s kmv also expects to introduce new products competition the moody’s investors service business competes with other credit rating agencies and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research institutional investors also have inhouse credit research capabilities moody’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s ratings “sp” a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp’s in other markets the reverse is true another rating agency competitor of moody’s is fitch a subsidiary of fimalac sa although moody’s and sp are each larger than fitch competition is expected to increase one or more additional significant rating agencies also may emerge in the united states if the securities and exchange commission “sec” expands the number of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations “nrsro” in february 2003 the sec designated dominion bond rating service ltd of canada “dbrs” a nrsro competition may also emerge from niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company in the insurance industry competition may also emerge in developed markets outside the united states over the next few years for example in response to the growth in the european capital markets and in developing markets any such rating agencies that may emerge may receive support from local governments or other institutions 5 

over the last decade additional rating agencies have been established primarily in emerging markets and as a result of local capital market regulation regulators worldwide have perceived that credit ratings can further regulatory objectives for the development of public fixedincome securities markets the result of such regulatory activity has been the creation of a number of primarily national rating agencies in various countries certain of these regulatory efforts may have the unintended effect of producing less credible ratings over time attempts to standardize ratings systems or criteria may make all rating systems and agencies appear undifferentiated obscuring variations in the quality of the ratings providers in addition since moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the united states it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets financial regulators are reviewing their approach to supervision and are seeking comments on changes to the global regulatory framework bank regulators under the oversight of the basel committee on banking supervision have proposed using refined risk assessments as the basis for minimum capital requirements the proposed standardized approach relies on rating agency opinions while the proposed internal ratings based approach relies on systems and processes maintained by the regulated bank the increased regulatory focus on credit risk presents both opportunities and challenges for moody’s global demand for credit ratings and risk management services may rise but regulatory actions may result in a greater number of rating agencies andor additional regulation of moody’s and its competitors alternatively banking or securities market regulators could seek to reduce the use of ratings in regulations thereby reducing certain elements of demand for ratings or otherwise seek to control the analysis or business of rating agencies credit rating agencies such as moody’s also compete with other means of managing credit risk such as credit insurance competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk also may pose a competitive threat to moody’s moody’s kmv’s main competitors for quantitative measures of default risk include the riskmetrics group sp creditsights ri’s financial technology institute in japan and other smaller vendors other firms may compete in the future baker hill a privately held company is moody’s kmv’s main competitor in the software market to assist banks in their commercial lending activities moody’s kmv’s training products have two main competitors omega performance a privately held firm and risk management association formerly robert morris associates a trade association serving the financial services industry in addition moody’s kmv competes with niche training organizations moody’s strategy moody’s intends to focus on the following opportunities expansion in financial centers moody’s serves its customers through its global network of offices and business affiliations moody’s currently maintains fullservice rating and marketing operations in global financial centers such as frankfurt hong kong london madrid milan new york paris singapore and tokyo moody’s expects that its global network will position it to benefit from the expansion of worldwide capital markets and thereby increase revenue moody’s also expects that the growth of its moody’s investors service business as a consequence of financial market integration under the european monetary union will continue moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures new rating products moody’s is pursuing numerous initiatives to expand credit ratings from public fixedincome securities markets to other sectors with credit risk exposures as the loan and capital markets converge moody’s expects to continue to expand its rating coverage of bank loans and project finance loans and securities moody’s has a committed effort to extend its credit opinion franchise to the global bank counterparty universe through ratings of emerging market banks including bank financial strength ratings insurance financial strength ratings in the property and casualty reinsurance and life insurance markets represent additional growth opportunities moody’s has also introduced issuer ratings for corporations not active in the debt markets for company ratings moody’s seeks to continue to add value by providing greater scope and depth of analysis of issues related to company creditworthiness including enhanced liquidity and cash flow analysis and evaluation of accounting corporate governance and risk transference issues moody’s has also introduced mutual fund indices and stylebased analytical tools to assist in evaluating fund portfolio characteristics and their performance additional opportunities in securitization the repackaging of financial assets has had a profound effect on the fixedincome markets new patterns of securitization are expected to emerge in the next decade although the bulk of assets securitized in the past five years 6 

have been consumer assets owned by banks commercial assets — principally commercial mortgages term receivables and corporate obligations — are now increasingly being securitized securitization has evolved into a strategic corporate finance tool in north america europe and japan and is evolving elsewhere internationally ongoing global development of nontraditional financial instruments such as derivatives future flow securities hybrids creditlinked bonds and catastrophe bonds should continue to support growth moody’s has introduced new services enabling investors to monitor the performance of their investments in structured finance covering assetbacked finance commercial mortgage finance residential mortgage finance and credit derivatives internetenhanced products and services moody’s is expanding its use of the internet and other electronic media to enhance client service moody’s website provides the public with instant access to ratings and provides subscribers with credit research internet delivery also enables moody’s to provide services to more individuals within a client organization than paperbased products and to offer highervalue services because of more timely delivery moody’s expects that access to these applications will increase client use of moody’s services moody’s expects to continue to invest in electronic media to capitalize on these and other opportunities expansion of credit research products and investment analytic tools moody’s plans to continue to expand its research and analytic products by producing additional products through internal development and by acquiring products recent initiatives that have been wellreceived by clients include new services providing analysis of default rates and default probabilities online facilities for retrieving current rating information on demand and risk analytics and performance data for several structured finance market sectors moody’s plans to develop services for other financial markets such as credit default swaps and equity finally the company is improving its capability to deliver its research to new customer segments by creating more targeted and customized research offerings and by licensing moody’s credit analysis and research for redistribution by third party providers new quantitative credit assessment services moody’s will continue to provide banks and other financial institutions with quantitative credit assessment services moody’s believes that there will be increased demand for such services because they enable customers trading or holding creditsensitive assets to produce better performance also recent proposals by international bank regulatory authorities to recognize banks’ internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining regulatory capital will encourage adoption of such services moody’s also expects to provide extensions to existing services and new services such as valuations of creditsensitive assets regulation moody’s investors service registers as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of 1940 as amended moody’s has also been designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization “nrsro” by the sec the sec first applied the nrsro designation in 1975 to agencies whose credit ratings could be used by brokerdealers for purposes of determining their net capital requirements since that time congress in certain mortgagerelated legislation the sec in its regulations under the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and the investment company act of 1940 as amended and other governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of nrsros to distinguish between among other things “investment grade” and “noninvestment grade” securities recently there has been discussion in the us regarding the continued use of ratings for regulatory purposes under federal securities laws and the potential need for either greater or lesser regulation and oversight of credit rating agencies in january 2003 the sec released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets the report considered a number of issues that the sec was required to examine under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other issues arising from an secinitiated review of credit rating agencies more specifically the sec identified five broad areas that deserved further examination      7 

 in the report the sec further stated that it intended to publish a concept release to solicit comments on issues affecting the role and operation of credit rating agencies and expected thereafter to propose rules in response to those comments subsequent to releasing its report in february 2003 the sec designated dominion bond rating service ltd of canada as a fourth nrsro together with moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch on june 4th the sec issued its concept release regarding the credit ratings industry the release restated many questions first raised in the commission’s january 2003 report and requested public comment on those questions questions were grouped under three broad themes    numerous market participants including moody’s responded to the call for comment moody’s response can be found on the company’s website at wwwmoodyscom  at present moody’s is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec’s ongoing review nor the nature and effect of any such regulatory changes moody’s is also subject to regulation in certain nonus jurisdictions in which it operates first as a consequence of the new french securities law rating agencies operating in france have a new document retention obligation and will be required annually to produce and submit a report to the newly established french regulatory authority on their operation secondly implementation guidelines proposed by the committee of european securities regulators “cesr” and implemented by the european commission “commission” for the commission’s market abuse directive “directive” are applicable to all participants in the european capital markets credit rating agencies however have been explicitly carved out of the directive’s provisions which address the manner of production and presentation of research however when the directive is incorporated into individual national legislation depending on the form in which the implementation guidelines are ultimately adopted at the national level such guidelines could be interpreted by some european union countries to control the functioning of credit rating agencies in their jurisdiction if so new regulation may among other things alter rating agencies’ communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process and increase moody’s cost of doing business in europe and the legal risk associated with such business finally in february 2004 the european parliament “parliament” adopted resolutions regarding rating agencies in europe pursuant to an internal study and report the resolutions call on the commission to conduct an analysis for registration of rating agencies in europe and possible registration criteria the resolutions further ask the commission and certain other european authorities to make specific recommendations by july 31 2005 in light of any further developments or conclusions reached by the financial services forum the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” and the us sec also in february 2004 a technical committee of the iosco announced that under the chairmanship of us sec commissioner roel campos it would develop with the contribution of the credit rating agencies a code of conduct for credit rating agencies the basel committee on banking supervision is preparing a new capital adequacy framework to replace the framework proposed in 1988 under this framework as now proposed ratings assigned by a credit rating agency would be an alternative available to certain banks to determine the risk weights for many of their credit exposures the basel committee’s proposal would institutionalize ratings of certain rating agencies as an alternative in the credit measurement processes of internationally active financial institutions and subject rating agencies to a broader range of oversight because the content of the proposal is not yet finalized moody’s cannot predict at this time the final form of any such regulation however moody’s does not believe that this proposal if adopted in its present form would materially affect moody’s investors service’s financial position or results of operations or the manner in which it conducts its business other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services has been considered from time to time by local national and multinational bodies and is likely to be considered in the future in certain countries governments may provide financial or other 8 

support to locallybased rating agencies in addition governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers if enacted any such legislation and regulation could significantly change the competitive landscape in which moody’s operates in addition the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future management of moody’s cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s intellectual property moody’s owns and controls a variety of trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights that in the aggregate are of material importance to moody’s business management of moody’s believes that each of the “moody’s” “moody’s kmv” and “kmv” name and related names marks and logos are of material importance to moody’s moody’s is licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others and similarly other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by moody’s moody’s considers its trademarks service marks databases software and other intellectual property to be proprietary and moody’s relies on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret patent nondisclosure and contract safeguards for protection in 2002 moody’s formed a new subsidiary mis quality management corp to own manage protect and license the trademarks of moody’s and its affiliates the names of moody’s products and services referred to herein are trademarks service marks or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or licensed to moody’s or one or more of its subsidiaries employees as of december 31 2003 the number of fulltime equivalent employees of moody’s was approximately 2300 available information moody’s investor relations internet website is httpirmoodyscom under the “sec filings” tab at this website the company makes available free of charge its annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the sec 9

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moody’s corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k certain of the statements below are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see “forwardlooking statements” on page 37 and “additional factors that may affect future results” on page 27 the company except where otherwise indicated the terms “moody’s” and the “company” refer to moody’s corporation and its subsidiaries moody’s is a provider of credit ratings research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions moody’s operates in two reportable segments moody’s investors service and moody’s kmv moody’s investors service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets including various corporate and governmental obligations structured finance securities and commercial paper programs as well as rating opinions on issuers of credit obligations it also publishes investororiented credit research including indepth research on major issuers industry studies special comments and credit opinion handbooks the moody’s kmv business consists of the combined businesses of kmv llc and kmv corporation “kmv” acquired in april 2002 and moody’s risk management services moody’s kmv develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in creditsensitive assets credit training services and credit process software the company operated as part of the dun  bradstreet corporation “old db” until september 30 2000 the “distribution date” when old db separated into two publicly traded companies — moody’s corporation and the new db corporation “new db” at that time old db distributed to its shareholders shares of new db stock new db comprised the business of old db’s dun  bradstreet operating company the “db business” the remaining business of old db consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services the “moody’s business” and was renamed “moody’s corporation” the method by which old db distributed to its shareholders its shares of new db stock is hereinafter referred to as the “2000 distribution” critical accounting estimates moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill pension and other postretirement benefits and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition revenue recognition in recognizing revenue related to ratings moody’s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods in such 14 

cases the company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods the portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer the estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities currently the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years at december 31 2003 and 2002 deferred revenue included approximately 26 million and 20 million respectively related to such deferred monitoring fees moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data at december 31 2003 and 2002 accounts receivable included approximately 26 million and 22 million respectively of accrued commercial paper revenue historically the company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings accounts receivable allowance moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance adjustments to and writeoffs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection experience and the current status of customer accounts moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers both from a marketplace and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its reviews moody’s establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole as considered appropriate this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts accordingly moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the abovenoted factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in allowances that are greater or less than moody’s estimates in each of 2003 and 2002 the company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance contingencies accounting for contingencies including those matters described in the “contingencies” section of this management’s discussion and analysis requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate  for the year ended december 31 2003 the provision for income taxes reflected an increase of 162 million in reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by moody’s in connection with its separation from the dun  bradstreet corporation in october 2000 these tax matters are discussed under “legacy tax matters” below since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the company has reserved their resolution could have a material effect on moody’s future reported results and financial position in addition potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material goodwill moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” moody’s goodwill balance is material 1264 million at december 31 2003 and the evaluation of goodwill requires that the company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates in estimating future operating results and cash flows moody’s considers internal budgets and strategic plans expected long term growth rates and the effects of external factors and market conditions if actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from 15 

the company’s judgments or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill which charge could be material to the company’s financial position and results of operations pension and other postretirement benefits the expenses assets liabilities and obligations that moody’s reports for pension and other postretirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances these assumptions include the following    in determining such assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from the company’s assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses assets and liabilities related to the company’s pension and other postretirement benefits the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point increase in each of these assumptions would have had on moody’s pretax expense in 2003 dollars in millions  

stockbased compensation on january 1 2003 the company adopted on a prospective basis the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 123” therefore employee stock options granted on and after january 1 2003 are being expensed by the company over the option vesting period based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant the estimated fair value is calculated based on a blackscholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable some of the assumptions and estimates such as share price volatility and expected option holding period are based in part on moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company which is limited the use of different assumptions and estimates in the blackscholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period 16 

an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on pretax expense in 2003 dollars in millions  

other estimates in addition there are other accounting estimates within moody’s consolidated financial statements including recoverability of deferred tax assets anticipated distributions from nonus subsidiaries realizability of longlived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody’s consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition see note 2 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact moody’s operating segments prior to 2002 the company operated in one reportable business segment – ratings which accounted for approximately 90 of the company’s total revenue with the april 2002 acquisition of kmv and its combination with moody’s risk management services to form moody’s kmv moody’s now operates in two reportable business segments moody’s investors service and moody’s kmv accordingly in the second quarter of 2002 the company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation in discussing periods prior to 2002 the moody’s kmv segment is referred to as moody’s risk management services “mrms” the predecessor business in order to provide additional information relating to moody’s operating results the discussion below includes information analyzing operating results as if the acquisition of kmv had been consummated as of january 1 2002 this information is presented in a manner consistent with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” and is described in more detail in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements the moody’s investors service business consists of four rating groups — structured finance corporate finance financial institutions and sovereign risk and public finance — that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixedincome instruments in the debt markets and research which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investororiented credit research principally produced by the rating groups given the dominance of moody’s investors service to moody’s overall results the company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses nor are they allocated to the company’s business segments accordingly all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the moody’s investors service segment and none have been allocated to the moody’s kmv segment the moody’s kmv business develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in creditsensitive assets credit training services and credit process software certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 17

declined us revenue growth was also derived from areas not related to public debt issuance such as syndicated bank loan ratings and relationshipbased fees in europe revenue grew by 19 million yeartoyear the dollar volume of issuance was up nearly 40 due primarily to refinancing activity as spreads tightened and new issuers accessed the market price increases also contributed to yeartoyear growth in global corporate finance revenue revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was 1812 million for 2003 an increase of 262 million or 169 from 1550 million for 2002 the yeartoyear growth was almost wholly due to europe where revenue growth exceeded 40 this reflected a substantial yeartoyear increase in issuance and the addition of new issuers in the us revenue was flat versus strong prior year comparisons price increases also contributed to global financial institutions revenue growth over the prior year period public finance revenue of 872 million for 2003 was up 60 million or 74 from 812 million in 2002 dollar issuance in the municipal bond market grew 5 versus 2002 but issuance of shortterm notes declined yeartoyear refinancings represented 34 of total dollar issuance in 2003 versus 33 in 2002 moody’s expects that public finance issuance and revenue will decline in 2004 as discussed below research revenue increased 333 million or 356 to 1269 million for 2003 compared with 936 million for 2002 revenue grew by 18 million in the us and 13 million in europe the strong performance was driven by growth in licensing of moody’s information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution sales of new products to existing clients and new clients foreign currency translation also contributed to yeartoyear growth in reported revenue moody’s investors service operating selling general and administrative expenses including corporate expenses were 4622 million in 2003 an increase of 765 million or 198 from 3857 million in 2002 compensation and benefits expense accounted for 52 million of the total expense growth this reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in europe and the global structured finance business as well as the specialist teams that support moody’s enhanced analysis initiative despite the increase in staffing incentive compensation decreased slightly yeartoyear due to lower growth in the company’s operating results in 2003 compared with 2002 other yeartoyear expense increases included 9 million related to the company’s change in accounting for stockbased compensation mainly for options granted in february 2003 7 million for increased professional fees mainly for legal fees and technology consulting costs and 4 million related to rent occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion foreign currency translation also contributed to yeartoyear growth in reported expenses depreciation and amortization expense was 154 million in 2003 versus 127 million in 2002 the yeartoyear increase of 27 million principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003 moody’s investors service operating income of 6571 million in 2003 was up 1137 million or 209 from 5434 million in 2002 moody’s kmv the following table shows moody’s kmv reported results for 2003 compared with the reported results for 2002 the “reported comparisons” and compared with 2002 on a pro forma basis presented as if moody’s had acquired kmv on january 1 2002 the “pro forma comparisons” in a manner consistent with sfas no 141 and as further described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements the discussion of mkmv results of operations that follows is based on the pro forma comparisons

  outlook moody’s outlook for 2004 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates consumer spending corporate profitability and business investment spending and capital markets issuance activity there is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions moody’s results for the year may differ significantly from the outlook presented below the company expects interest rates in the united states to rise during 2004 with reduced refinancings of debt and continued weak demand for financing to support business investment as a result moody’s expects to see lower issuance in the us corporate bond market both in the investment grade sector and in the high yield sector which posted record issuance in 2003 despite the issuance declines revenue from new products and growth in relationshipbased revenue should produce modest growth in both the us corporate finance and financial institutions sectors the company is continuing to introduce the enhanced analysis initiative consisting of financial reporting offbalance sheet risk transference and corporate governance assessment reports and moody’s plans to cover approximately 350 corporations and financial institutions in north america by the end of 2004 moody’s also expects good growth in consumer spending in 2004 as a result the company expects that growth in revenue from rating assetbacked securitizations together with moderate growth in the commercial mortgage securitization and credit derivatives segments of the business will substantially offset an important decline in revenue from rating residential mortgagebacked securities as the very strong refinancing activity of the past two years declines in the public finance ratings business moody’s expects a revenue decline of approximately 20 in 2004 reflecting projected slowing of issuance related to both refinancings and “new money” borrowings the company expects continued strong growth in the us research business outside the us moody’s expects to see doubledigit revenue growth in the corporate and financial institutions ratings businesses the company is also projecting strong yearoveryear growth for structured finance ratings revenue and in the research business all producing approximately 20 international revenue growth in ratings and research including the effects of currency translation finally moody’s expects high teens percent revenue growth globally at moody’s kmv moody’s expenses for 2004 will likely reflect continued investment spending on improving and increasing the transparency of ratings practices technology initiatives and product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business the company will continue investment in the enhanced analysis initiative moody’s expects its operating margin to decline about 100 basis points in 2004 from the level achieved in 2003 due to investments being made and the faster growth of the lower margin mkmv business an additional 100 basis point decline in operating margin is expected due to higher expense for stockbased compensation since the company adopted expensing of stockbased compensation prospectively effective january 1 2003 the higher expense is due in part to the phasing in of expense over the current fouryear option vesting period overall for 2004 moody’s expects that yearoveryear revenue growth will be in the mid to high single digit percent range with the impact of a slightly lower effective tax rate and share repurchases the company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the mid to high single digit percent range on a reported basis reported earnings per share in 2003 included the impacts of the insurance gain the legacy tax reserve increase and the expensing of stockbased compensation discussed above the impact of expensing stockbased compensation will also be included in reported earnings per share in 2004 and is expected to be approximately 010 to 011 per share in 2004 compared with 004 per share in 2003 additional factors that may affect future results the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently 27 

known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occur moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets approximately 80 of moody’s revenue in 2003 was derived from ratings a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of creditsensitive securities in the global capital markets moody’s enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2003 that was greater than its historical averages principally due to strong growth in global structured finance and corporate finance issuance volumes the us components of which were driven by a highly favorable interest rate environment the company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets therefore the company’s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which moody’s provides ratings services in addition increases in interest rates volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment significant political or economic events defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers andor the types of creditsensitive products being offered a sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on moody’s business and financial results possible loss of market share or revenue through competition or regulation the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive moody’s competes on the basis of a number of factors including quality of ratings client service research reputation price geographic scope range of products and technological innovation moody’s faces increasing competition from sp fitch dbrs local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company in the insurance industry since moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the us it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions currently moody’s sp fitch and dbrs are designated as nrsros by the sec on june 4 2003 the sec issued a concept release regarding the credit ratings industry wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas 1 should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws 2 if so what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use and 3 if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used elimination of the nrsro concept retention of the nrsro concept with different regulatory oversight or sec recognition of additional nrsros could result in loss of market share or revenue for moody’s or higher costs of operations introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more costeffective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service moody’s intends to continue providing the highest quality 28 

products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets however if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors moody’s may lose market share possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled experienced financial analysts and other professionals competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis moody’s ability to effectively compete will continue to depend among other things on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees exposure to litigation related to moody’s rating opinions moody’s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions in addition as moody’s international business expands these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the first amendment these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time potential emergence of governmentsponsored credit rating agencies when governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected governmentmandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness in these circumstances issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating which may negatively affect the company proposed us foreign state and local legislation and regulations including those relating to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in the us and other countries the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve recently there has been discussion in the us regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies in january 2003 the sec released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets the report considered a number of issues that the sec was required to examine under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other issues arising from a secinitiated review of credit rating agencies in june 2003 the sec released a concept release which posed questions about the continued use of credit ratings for regulatory purposes in federal securities laws the process for determining rating agencies whose ratings could be so used and the appropriate level of oversight of such rating agencies in february 2004 the european parliament adopted resolutions calling on the european commission to conduct an analysis for registration of rating agencies in europe and possible registration criteria at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the sec or other regulatory bodies implementation guidelines proposed by the committee of european securities regulators under the european commission’s market abuse directive are applicable to all participants in the european capital markets credit rating agencies are excluded from control under the guidelines however depending on the form in which the implementation guidelines are ultimately adopted by national regulators or lawmakers such guidelines could include controls over credit rating agencies in some european union countries if so the guidelines could among other things alter rating agencies’ communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process and increase moody’s cost of doing business in europe and the legal risk associated with such business 29 

multinational operations moody’s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the us operations in several different countries expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as          although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations of the company any of these factors could have such an effect in the future contingencies from time to time moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation that are incidental to the company’s business including claims based on ratings assigned by moody’s management periodically assesses the company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available for those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements in other instances because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability if any as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly based on its review of the latest information available in the opinion of management the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on moody’s financial position results of operations or cash flows subject to the contingencies described below discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to old db its predecessors and their affiliated companies “legacy contingencies” and those that relate to moody’s business and operations “moody’s matters” legacy contingencies to understand the company’s exposure to the potential liabilities described below it is important to understand the relationship between moody’s and new db and the relationship among new db and its predecessors and other parties who through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters in november 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation through a spinoff separated into three separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation acnielsen corporation “acnielsen” and cognizant corporation “cognizant” the “1996 distribution” 30 

in june 1998 the dun  bradstreet corporation through a spinoff separated into two separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation and rh donnelley corporation “donnelley” the “1998 distribution” during 1998 cognizant through a spinoff separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated “ims health” and nielsen media research inc “nmr” in september 2000 the dun  bradstreet corporation “old db” through a spinoff separated into two separate public companies new db and moody’s as further described in note 1 description of business and basis of presentation information resources inc in july 1996 information resources inc “iri” filed a complaint in the u s district court for the southern district of new york naming as defendants the corporation then known as the dun  bradstreet corporation ac nielsen company a subsidiary of acnielsen and ims international inc a subsidiary of the company then known as cognizant at the time of the filing of the complaint each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of the dun  bradstreet corporation the complaint alleges various violations of united states antitrust laws under sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act the complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship these claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of survey research group limited “srg” iri alleges srg violated an alleged agreement with iri when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced srg to breach that agreement iri’s antitrust claims allege that the defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine iri’s ability to compete within the us and foreign markets in north america latin america asia europe and australianew zealand through a series of anticompetitive practices including unlawfully tyingbundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which acnielsen competed with iri entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny iri’s access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data predatory pricing acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding iri’s efforts to expand disparaging iri to financial analysts and clients and denying iri access to capital necessary for it to compete iri’s complaint originally alleged damages in excess of 350 million which iri asked to be trebled under antitrust laws iri has since revised its allegation of damages to exceed 650 million which iri also asked to be trebled iri also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount in april 2003 the court denied a motion for partial summary judgment by the defendants that sought to dismiss certain of iri’s claims and granted in part a motion by iri seeking reconsideration of certain summary judgment rulings the court had previously made in favor of the defendants in december of 2003 iri was acquired by the gingko acquisition corporation an affiliate of symphony technology ii – a l p and certain other parties as part of that transaction a statutory trust called the information resources inc litigation contingent payment rights trust the “trust” was formed the trust was created in part to issue contingent value rights certificates “cvrs” which represent an interest in the iri lawsuit the cvrs are governed by a contingent value rights agreement among iri and the acquirers and are a tradeable security listed on the otc bulletin board as part of the purchase consideration each iri stockholder received one cvr for each share of iri common stock owned entitling the selling stockholders to a pro rata portion of the proceeds from the iri lawsuit if any allocated to the trust the trust will be entitled to receive an amount equal to 68 of any proceeds from the iri lawsuit to the extent that such proceeds are equal to or less than 200 million and 75 of any such proceeds in excess of 200 million the remaining proceeds if any will be the property of iri a body consisting of five rights agents was appointed to direct and supervise the iri litigation on behalf of iri and cvr holders gingko corporation named two of the rights agents iri named two of the rights agents and these four rights agents selected the fifth “independent” rights agent under the contingent value rights agreement a majority of the rights agents other than the independent rights agent must approve any settlement of the iri lawsuit the information contained in this paragraph is solely based on the tender offer statement filed by gingko acquisition corporation and other persons and the registration statement filed by the trust in connection with the acquisition of iri in connection with the 1996 distribution nmr then known as cognizant corporation acnielsen and donnelley then known as the dun  bradstreet corporation entered into an indemnity and joint defense agreement the “indemnity and joint defense 31 

agreement” pursuant to which they agreed to   in particular the indemnity and joint defense agreement provides that   as noted above acnielsen is responsible for the iri liabilities up to the acn maximum amount the indemnity and joint defense agreement provides that acnielsen initially is to determine the amount that it will pay at the time of settlement or a final judgment if any in iri’s favor the “acn payment” the acn payment could be less than the acn maximum amount the indemnity and joint defense agreement also provides for each of donnelley and nmr to pay iri 50 of the difference between the settlement or judgment amount and the acn payment and for acnielsen to issue a secured note the “acn note” subject to certain limits to each of donnelley and nmr for the amount of their payment the principal amount of each acn note issued to donnelley and nmr however is limited to 50 of the difference between the acn maximum amount and the acn payment and is subject to a further limitation that it cannot exceed 50 of the amount of any proceeds from any recapitalization plan designed to maximize acnielsen’s claims paying ability the acn notes would become payable upon the completion of any such recapitalization plan the indemnity and joint defense agreement also provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment then nmr and donnelley shall obtain the bond required for the appeal and each shall pay 50 of the costs of such bond if any which cost will be added to iri liabilities under the terms of the 2000 distribution moody’s would be responsible for 25 of the total costs of any bond the acn maximum amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that acnielsen is able to pay after giving effect to   for these purposes “viability” means the ability of acnielsen after giving effect to such recapitalization plan the payment of interest on the acn notes the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the acn maximum amount to   in 2001 acnielsen was acquired by vnu nv vnu nv assumed acnielsen’s liabilities under the indemnity and joint defense agreement and pursuant to the indemnity and joint defense agreement vnu nv is to be included with acnielsen for purposes of determining the acn maximum amount in connection with the 1998 distribution old db and donnelley then known as the dun  bradstreet corporation entered into an agreement the “1998 distribution agreement” whereby old db assumed all potential liabilities of donnelley arising from the iri action and agreed to indemnify donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities under the terms of the 2000 distribution new db undertook to be jointly and severally liable with moody’s for old db’s obligations to donnelley under the 1998 distribution agreement including any liabilities arising under the indemnity and joint defense agreement and arising from the iri action itself however as between new db and moody’s it was agreed that under the 2000 distribution each of new db and moody’s will be responsible for 50 of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of donnelley with respect to the iri action under the terms of the 1998 distribution agreement including legal fees or expenses related to the iri action 32 

as a result the company will be responsible for the payment of 25 of the portion of any judgment or settlement in excess of the acn maximum amount as adjusted to include vnu nv new db will be responsible for the payment of an additional 25 together constituting donnelley’s liability under the indemnity and joint defense agreement for 50 of such amount and nmr will be responsible for payment of the remaining 50 of liability in excess of the acn maximum amount in addition each of the above parties in accordance with the foregoing percentages may be required to advance a portion of the amount if any by which the acn maximum amount exceeds the amount of the acn payment however because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because many of the rights and obligations relating to the indemnity and joint defense agreement are based on contractual relationships the failure of a party to the indemnity and joint defense agreement to fulfill its obligations could result in the other parties bearing a greater share of the iri liabilities as a result of their 1998 separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement ims health and nmr are each jointly and severally liable for all cognizant liabilities under the indemnity and joint defense agreement discovery in the lawsuit is ongoing and although the court earlier set a trial date for september 2004 the court rescinded that date in january 2004 and there is currently no trial date set moody’s is unable to predict at this time the outcome of the iri action or the financial condition of acnielsen and vnu nv at the time of any such outcome and hence the company cannot estimate the amount of the acn payment the acn maximum amount and the portion of any judgment to be paid by vnu nv and acnielsen under the indemnity and joint defense agreement therefore moody’s is unable to predict at this time whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows accordingly no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if however iri were to prevail in whole or in part in this action or if moody’s is required to pay or advance a significant portion of any settlement or judgment the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on moody’s financial position results of operations and cash flows legacy tax matters old db and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business including through taxfree restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities pursuant to a series of agreements as between themselves ims health and nmr are jointly and severally liable to pay onehalf and new db and moody’s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half of any payments for taxes penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable irs rulings on certain tax matters excluding the matter described below as “amortization expense deductions” for which new db and moody’s are solely responsible and certain other potential tax liabilities after new db andor moody’s pays the first 137 million which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as “utilization of capital losses” in connection with the 2000 distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related distribution agreement new db and moody’s have between themselves agreed to each be financially responsible for 50 of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations without limiting the generality of the foregoing three specific tax matters are discussed below royalty expense deductions during the second quarter of 2003 new db received an examination report from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993 in this report the irs stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old db on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 new db disagrees with the position taken by the irs in its report during the third quarter of 2003 new db filed a protest with the appeals office of the irs to contest the examination report if the irs appeals office were to uphold the examination report then new db could either 1 accept and pay the irs assessment 2 challenge the assessment in us tax court or 3 challenge the assessment in us district court or the us court of federal claims where payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge should any such payments be made by new db then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement moody’s would have to pay to new db its 50 share 33 

moody’s estimates that its share of the required payment to the irs could be up to approximately 57 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability in a related matter during the second quarter of 2003 new db received an examination report from the irs stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction and to reallocate to old db income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 during the third quarter of 2003 the partnership filed a protest with the appeals office of the irs to contest the examination report if the irs appeals office were to uphold the examination report then new db could either 1 accept and pay the irs assessment 2 challenge the assessment in us tax court or 3 challenge the assessment in us district court or the us court of federal claims where payment of the assessment would be required in connection with such challenge should any such payments be made by new db then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement moody’s would have to pay to new db its 50 share moody’s estimates that its share of the required payment to the irs for this matter could be up to approximately 50 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph and moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability during the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004 new db participated in meetings with the irs appeals office on the two matters described above in addition in the first quarter of 2004 new db received an examination report relating to old db’s participation in the partnership structure for the first quarter of 1997 in this report the irs stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old db on its tax return for the 1997 tax year new db also received an examination report issued to the partnership with respect to its 1997 tax year in this examination report the irs stated its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction and to reallocate to old db income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1997 new db disagrees with the positions taken by the irs in its reports and will pursue the same remedies with the same possible consequences described above moody’s estimates that its share of the required payment to the irs in relation to the two examination reports could be up to approximately 15 million and 03 million respectively including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits moody’s believes that the irs’s proposed assessments of tax against old db and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to old db are inconsistent with each other accordingly while it is possible that the irs could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions moody’s believes that it is unlikely that the irs will prevail on both amortization expense deductions during the fourth quarter of 2003 new db received a notice of proposed adjustment from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1997 that could result in amortization expense deductions from 1997 through 2012 in this notice the irs proposed to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by old db on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns new db disagrees with the position taken by the irs irs audits of old db’s or new db’s tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar notices of proposed adjustment if the irs were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the notices for 1997 and 1998 or for future years then new db could either 1 accept and pay the irs assessment 2 challenge the assessment in us tax court or 3 challenge the assessment in us district court or the us court of federal claims where payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge should any such payments be made by new db then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement moody’s would have to pay to new db its 50 share in addition should new db discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns moody’s would be required to repay to new db an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50 share of the related future tax benefits new db had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to moody’s at the distribution date moody’s estimates that the company’s current potential exposure related to this matter is 92 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits this exposure could increase by approximately 3 million to 6 million per year depending on actions that the irs may take and on whether new db continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns also during the fourth quarter of 2003 new db received a notice of proposed adjustment from the irs with respect to the partnership transaction entered into in 1997 in this notice the irs proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old db on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns in addition the irs proposed to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate 34 

to old db certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998 new db disagrees with the positions taken by the irs if the irs were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the notices for 1997 and 1998 or for future years then new db could either 1 accept and pay the irs assessment 2 challenge the assessment in us tax court 3 challenge the assessment in us district court or the us court of federal claims where payment of the assessment would be required in connection with such challenge should any such payments be made by new db then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement moody’s would have to pay to new db its 50 share of new db’s payments to the irs for the period from 1997 through the distribution date moody’s estimates that its share of the potential payment to the irs could be up to approximately 125 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability moody’s believes that the irs’s proposed assessments of tax against old db and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to old db are inconsistent with each other accordingly while it is possible that the irs could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions moody’s believes that it is unlikely that the irs will prevail on both utilization of capital losses the irs has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990 on june 26 2000 the irs as part of its audit process issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and old db responded by filing a petition for a refund in the us district court on september 21 2000 after the payments described below were made the case is expected to go to trial in 2005 on may 12 2000 an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods which reflected 5616 million of tax and interest due old db paid the irs approximately 3493 million of this amount on may 12 2000 50 of such payment was allocated to moody’s and had previously been accrued by the company ims health informed old db that it paid to the irs approximately 2123 million on may 17 2000 the payments were made to the irs to stop further interest from accruing and new db is contesting the irs’ assessment new db has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts if any in excess of the amounts paid with the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence moody’s does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to irs assessments for this matter if the irs were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter moody’s estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes penalties and interest net of tax benefits on this matter would be approximately 5 million subsequent to making its may 2000 payment to the irs ims health sought partial reimbursement from nmr under their 1998 distribution agreement the “imsnmr agreement” nmr paid ims health less than the amount sought by ims health under the imsnmr agreement and in 2001 ims health filed an arbitration proceeding against nmr to recover the difference ims health sought to include old db in this arbitration arguing that if nmr should prevail in its interpretation of the imsnmr agreement then ims health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against old db neither old db nor any of its predecessors was a party to the imsnmr agreement on april 29 2003 an arbitration panel ruled in favor of ims health in the arbitration proceeding awarding ims health its full claim plus interest in a decision binding on all parties as a result ims health’s contingent claim against old db and consequently moody’s and new db in connection with this matter has been rendered moot as no amount with respect to this matter had been accrued by moody’s the arbitration panel ruling is not expected to have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements summary of moody’s exposure to three legacy tax matters the company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances in doing so moody’s makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis as of december 31 2003 moody’s had reserves of approximately 126 million with respect to such matters which reflected an increase of approximately 16 million during the fourth quarter of 2003 relating to the amortization expense deductions matter although the matter had previously been under audit the company felt that an increase in the related reserve was appropriate since the notices of proposed adjustment during the fourth quarter of 2003 reflected a formalization by the irs of its position on the matter it is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the company which could result in additional charges that may be

relationships including industrial corporations financial institutions governmental entities and structured finance issuers and over 67000 public finance obligations issued in the us market  ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media including the internet and realtime information systems widely used by securities traders and investors in addition to credit rating services for issuers moody’s provides research services that are utilized by institutional investors and other credit and capital market professionals clients of these services represent more than 3000 institutions worldwide with over 20000 registered users globally moody’s offers a wide range of research products and services covering various segments of the debt capital markets while research analysis and data are delivered through a number of channels most of moody’s clients use the company’s website wwwmoodyscom for access to such services in a realtime environment the moody’s kmv business consists of the combined businesses of kmv llc and kmv corporation “kmv” acquired in april 2002 and moody’s risk management services moody’s kmv is a provider of marketbased quantitative services for banks and investors in creditsensitive assets and serves over 1500 clients operating in 60 countries including most of the world’s 100 largest financial institutions moody’s kmv’s quantitative models estimate the probability of default for over 25000 publicly traded firms globally updated daily in addition moody’s kmv’s riskcalc tm models extend the availability of these probabilities to privately held firms in many of the world’s economies moody’s kmv also offers services to value and improve the performance of creditsensitive portfolios other services include credit training and software products to assist financial institutions in commercial lending activities prospects for growth over the past decade global public and private fixedincome markets have grown significantly in terms of outstanding principal amount and types of securities while there is potential for periodic cyclical disruption in these developments moody’s believes that the overall trend and outlook remain favorable for the continued growth in capital market activity worldwide in addition the securities being issued in the global fixedincome markets are becoming more complex moody’s expects that these trends will provide continued longterm demand for highquality independent credit opinions these phenomena are especially apparent in europe where economic and monetary union is driving increased use of public fixedincome markets for corporate financing activities technology such as the internet makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world this technology facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets issuers and investors are also more readily able to obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell many of which may be unfamiliar to them this availability of information promotes worldwide financial markets and a greater need for credible and globally comparable credit ratings as a result a number of new capital markets have emerged in addition more issuers and investors are accessing traditional capital markets another trend that is increasing the size of the world capital markets is the ongoing disintermediation of financial systems issuers are increasingly financing in the global public capital markets in addition to or in substitution for traditional financial intermediaries moreover financial intermediaries are selling assets in the global public capital markets in addition to or instead of retaining those assets structured finance securities markets for many types of assets have developed in many countries and are contributing to these trends the complexity of capital market instruments is also growing consequently assessing the credit risk of such instruments becomes more of a challenge for financial intermediaries and asset managers in the credit markets reliable thirdparty ratings increasingly supplement or substitute for traditional inhouse research as the geographic scope and complexity of financial markets grow rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of moody’s investors service therefore a substantial portion of moody’s revenue is dependent upon the volume and number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets moody’s is therefore affected by the performance of and the prospects for the major world economies and by the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments however annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers and annual fees from commercial paper and mediumterm note programs bank and insurance company financial strength ratings mutual fund ratings subscriptionbased 4 research and other areas are less dependent on or independent of the volume or number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets moody’s operations are also subject to various politically related risks inherent in carrying on business internationally such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization expropriation exchange and price controls changes in the availability of data from public sector sources limits on providing information across borders or other restrictive governmental actions management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources growth in moody’s kmv is expected from increasing adoption of quantitative credit management techniques by financial institutions globally and by corporations managing trade receivables increased use of credit models is expected under the forthcoming revised international bank regulatory regime known as “basel ii” moody’s kmv also expects to introduce new products competition the moody’s investors service business competes with other credit rating agencies and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research institutional investors also have inhouse credit research capabilities moody’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard  poor’s credit market services “sp” a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc there are some rating markets based on industry geography andor instrument type in which moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to sp’s in other markets the reverse is true another rating agency competitor of moody’s is fitch a subsidiary of fimalac sa although moody’s and sp are each larger than fitch competition is expected to increase one or more additional significant rating agencies also may emerge in the united states if the securities and exchange commission “sec” expands the number of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations “nrsro” in february 2003 the sec designated dominion bond rating service ltd of canada a nrsro competition may also emerge from niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company in the insurance industry and in developed markets outside the united states over the next few years for example in response to the growth in the european capital markets and in developing markets such rating agencies may receive support from local governments or other institutions over the last decade additional rating agencies have been established primarily in emerging markets and as a result of local capital market regulation regulators worldwide have perceived that credit ratings can further regulatory objectives for the development of public fixedincome securities markets the result of such regulatory activity has been the creation of a number of primarily national rating agencies in various countries certain of these regulatory efforts may have the unintended effect of producing less credible ratings over time attempts to standardize ratings systems or criteria may make all rating systems and agencies appear undifferentiated obscuring variations in the quality of the ratings providers in addition since moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the united states it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets financial regulators are reviewing their approach to supervision and are seeking comments on changes to the global regulatory framework bank regulators under the oversight of the basel committee on banking supervision have proposed using refined risk assessments as the basis for minimum capital requirements the proposed standardized approach relies on rating agency opinions while the internal ratings based approach relies on systems and processes maintained by the regulated bank the increased regulatory focus on credit risk presents both opportunities and challenges for moody’s global demand for credit ratings and risk management services may rise but regulatory actions may result in a greater number of rating agencies andor additional regulation of moody’s and its competitors alternatively banking or securities market regulators could seek to reduce the use of ratings in regulations thereby reducing certain elements of demand for ratings or otherwise seek to control the analysis or business of rating agencies credit rating agencies such as moody’s also compete with other means of managing credit risk such as credit insurance competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk also may pose a competitive threat to moody’s moody’s kmv’s main competitors for quantitative measures of default risk include the riskmetrics group sp creditsight ri’s financial technology institute in japan and other smaller vendors in the area of portfolio modeling for creditsensitive assets 5 moody’s kmv’s primary competitor is the riskmetrics group other firms may compete in the future baker hill a privately held company is moody’s kmv’s main competitor in the software market to assist banks in their commercial lending activities moody’s kmv’s training products have two main competitors omega performance a privately held firm and risk management association formerly robert morris associates a trade association serving the financial services industry in addition moody’s kmv competes with niche training organizations moody’s strategy moody’s intends to focus on the following opportunities expansion in financial centers moody’s serves its customers through its global network of offices and business affiliations moody’s currently maintains fullservice rating and marketing operations in global financial centers such as frankfurt hong kong london madrid milan new york paris singapore and tokyo moody’s expects that its global network will position it to benefit from the expansion of worldwide capital markets and thereby increase revenue moody’s also expects that the growth of its moody’s investors service business as a consequence of financial market integration under the european monetary union will continue moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures new rating products moody’s is pursuing numerous initiatives to expand credit ratings from public fixedincome securities markets to other sectors with credit risk exposures as the loan and capital markets converge moody’s expects to continue to expand its rating coverage of bank loans and project finance loans and securities moody’s has a committed effort to extend its credit opinion franchise to the global bank counterparty universe through ratings of emerging market banks including bank financial strength ratings insurance financial strength ratings in the property and casualty reinsurance and life insurance markets represent additional growth opportunities moody’s has also introduced issuer ratings for corporations not active in the debt markets for company ratings moody’s seeks to continue to add value by providing greater scope and depth of analysis of issues related to company creditworthiness including enhanced liquidity and cash flow analysis and evaluation of accounting corporate governance and risk transference issues moody’s has also introduced mutual fund indices and stylebased analytical tools to assist in evaluating fund portfolio characteristics and their performance additional opportunities in securitization the repackaging of financial assets has had a profound effect on the fixedincome markets new patterns of securitization are expected to emerge in the next decade although the bulk of assets securitized in the past five years have been consumer assets owned by banks commercial assets — principally commercial mortgages term receivables and corporate obligations — are now increasingly being securitized securitization has evolved into a strategic corporate finance tool in north america europe and japan and is evolving elsewhere internationally ongoing global development of nontraditional financial instruments such as derivatives future flow securities hybrids creditlinked bonds and catastrophe bonds should continue to support growth moody’s has introduced new services enabling investors to monitor the performance of their investments in structured finance covering assetbacked finance commercial mortgage finance residential mortgage finance and credit derivatives internetenhanced products and services moody’s is expanding its use of the internet and other electronic media to enhance client service moody’s web site provides the public with instant access to ratings and provides subscribers with credit research internet delivery also enables moody’s to provide services to more individuals within a client organization than paperbased products and to offer highervalue services because of more timely delivery moody’s expects that access to these applications will increase client use of moody’s services moody’s expects to continue to invest in electronic media to capitalize on these and other opportunities expansion of credit research products and investment analytic tools moody’s plans to continue to expand its research and analytic products by producing additional products through internal development and by acquiring products recent initiatives that have been wellreceived by clients include new services providing analysis of default rates and default probabilities and online facilities for retrieving current rating information on demand moody’s plans to develop services for other financial markets such as credit default swaps and equity finally the company is improving its capability to deliver its research to new customer segments by creating more targeted and customized research offerings and by licensing moody’s credit analysis and research for redistribution by third party providers new quantitative credit assessment services moody’s will continue to provide banks and other financial institutions with quantitative credit assessment services moody’s believes that there will be increased demand for such services because they enable customers trading or holding creditsensitive assets to produce better performance also recent proposals by international bank regulatory authorities to recognize banks’ internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining regulatory capital 6 will encourage adoption of such services moody’s also expects to provide extensions to existing services and new services such as valuations of creditsensitive assets regulation moody’s investors service registers as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of 1940 as amended moody’s has been designated as a nrsro by the sec the sec first applied the nrsro designation in 1975 to agencies whose credit ratings could be used by brokerdealers for purposes of determining their net capital requirements since that time congress in certain mortgagerelated legislation the sec in its regulations under the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and the investment company act of 1940 as amended and other governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of nrsros to distinguish between among other things “investment grade” and “noninvestment grade” securities recently there has been discussion in the us regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies in october 2002 the staff of the senate committee on governmental affairs issued a report that recommended changes in sec regulation of rating agencies in january 2003 the sec released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets the report considers a number of issues that the sec was required to examine under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other issues arising from a secinitiated review of credit rating agencies more specifically the sec identified five broad areas that deserve further examination  in the report the sec stated that it intends to publish a concept release in early 2003 to solicit comments on a number of issues affecting the role and operation of credit rating agencies and expects thereafter to propose rules in response to those comments subsequent to releasing its report in february 2003 the sec designated dominion bond rating service ltd of canada a nrsro at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec’s ongoing review moody’s is also subject to regulation in certain nonus jurisdictions in which it operates in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to localbased rating agencies in addition governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers implementation guidelines proposed by the committee of european securities regulators under the european commission’s market abuse directive are applicable to many participants in the european capital markets including credit rating agencies depending on the form in which they are ultimately adopted such implementation guidelines may increase moody’s cost of doing business in europe and the legal risk associated with such business the basel committee on banking supervision is preparing a new capital adequacy framework to replace the framework adopted in 1998 under this framework as now proposed ratings assigned by a credit rating agency would be an alternative available to certain banks to determine the risk weights for many of their credit exposures the basel committee’s proposal would institutionalize ratings of certain rating agencies as an alternative in the credit measurement processes of internationally active financial institutions and subject rating agencies to a broader range of oversight because the content of the proposal is not yet finalized moody’s cannot predict at this time the final form of any such regulation however moody’s does not believe that this proposal if adopted in its present form would materially affect moody’s investors service’s financial position its results of operations or the manner in which it conducts its business other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services has been considered from time to time by local national and multinational bodies and is likely to be considered in the future if enacted any such legislation and regulation could significantly change the competitive landscape in which moody’s operates management of moody’s cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted or the ultimate impact on the competitive position financial position or results of operations of moody’s 7 intellectual property moody’s owns and controls a variety of trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names copyrights patents and other intellectual property

and moody’s risk management services moody’s kmv develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in creditsensitive assets credit training services and credit process software factors affecting comparability the company operated as part of the dun  bradstreet corporation “old db” until september 30 2000 the “distribution date” when old db separated into two publicly traded companies — moody’s corporation and the new db corporation “new db” at that time old db distributed to its shareholders shares of new db stock new db comprised the business of old db’s dun  bradstreet operating company the “db business” the remaining business of old db consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services the “moody’s business” and was renamed “moody’s corporation” the method by which old db distributed to its shareholders its shares of new db stock is hereinafter referred to as the “2000 distribution” in general pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement entered into at the distribution date all assets and liabilities of the db business were allocated to new db and all assets and liabilities of the moody’s business were allocated to moody’s the net indebtedness of old db at the distribution date was allocated equally between the parties before giving effect to certain adjustments the consolidated financial statements of moody’s corporation reflect the financial position results of operations and cash flows of moody’s as if it were a separate entity for all periods presented the financial statements include allocations of certain old db corporate headquarters assets and liabilities that were transferred from old db at the distribution date as well as allocations of certain expenses for employee benefits centralized services and corporate overhead that were provided by old db for periods prior to the distribution date see note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements description of business and basis of presentation for additional information the expense allocations were based on utilization of specific services or where such an estimate could not be determined based on moody’s revenue in proportion to old db’s total revenue although management believes these expense allocations were reasonable they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity critical accounting policies and estimates moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be 13 reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moody’s evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances deferred tax assets undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries contingencies valuation of investments in affiliates longlived and intangible assets goodwill pension and other postretirement benefits and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting policies are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made revenue recognition in recognizing revenue related to ratings moody’s uses judgments to match billed revenue with services to be provided in the future these judgments are generally not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods moody’s monitors its ratings on issuers and their outstanding securities in cases where the company does not charge ongoing annual fees or other monitoring fees for a particular issuer the company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes such fees over the estimated monitoring periods at december 31 2002 and 2001 deferred revenue included approximately 20 million and 15 million respectively related to estimated deferred monitoring fees in addition moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available at december 31 2002 and 2001 accounts receivable included approximately 22 million and 18 million respectively of accrued commercial paper revenue historically the company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings accounts receivable allowance moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance adjustments to and writeoffs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance moody’s evaluates its estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments to provision rates and the accounts receivable allowance as considered appropriate in 2002 the company reduced its provision rates and allowance to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance deferred tax assets and undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries in assessing the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances moody’s considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies based on these assessments moody’s has determined that it expects to be able to realize in the future its deferred tax assets which totaled 386 million at december 31 2002 however if moody’s profitability or other circumstances were to change adversely the company could determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future in such case a valuation allowance would be established and an increase in the tax provision would result in the period such determination was made in addition the company has approximately 13 million of undistributed earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided it is currently management’s intention to permanently reinvest those earnings in the subsidiaries if management’s approach to reinvesting those earnings changed or such earnings were distributed to the us incremental expense of approximately 12 million for us federal and foreign income taxes would be incurred contingencies accounting for contingencies including those matters described in the “contingencies” section of this management’s discussion and analysis requires the use of judgment and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent management’s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate  since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the company has reserved their resolution could have a material effect on moody’s future reported results and financial position in addition potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material 14 investments in affiliates longlived and intangible assets and goodwill moody’s assesses the impairment of its investments in affiliates and longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” these evaluations require the use of judgment as to the effects of external factors and market conditions on the company’s conduct of its operations and they require the use of estimates in projecting future operating results if actual external conditions or future operating results differ from the company’s judgments impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of the subject assets based on its assessment in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company recorded a charge of 34 million pretax to writedown a portion of its equity investment in two argentine rating agencies pension and other postretirement benefits moody’s employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances including compensation increases longterm return on pension plan assets health care cost trends discount rates and other factors in determining such assumptions the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from the company’s assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants while the company believes that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expenses and liabilities related to the company’s pension and other postretirement benefits following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that the company makes in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits  stockbased compensation in 2002 and prior years the company elected not to recognize in its consolidated financial statements compensation expense related to employee stock options and instead disclosed the related pro forma net income and earnings per share effects in the notes to its consolidated financial statements the stock option values that underlie the disclosures are based on a blackscholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable however circumstances occurring subsequent to issuance of the options could cause the actual value of the options to differ from these estimates  on january 1 2003 the company adopted on a prospective basis the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123  accounting for stockbased compensation” as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 123” therefore employee stock options granted on and after january 1 2003 will be expensed by the company over the option vesting period based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant in addition shares issued to participants in the company’s employee stock purchase plan will be expensed by the company based on the discount from the market price received by the participants on the date of issuance using what the company believes are reasonable assumptions and the blackscholes option pricing model the estimated impact of this change will be approximately 004 per diluted share in 2003 in future years as this change in accounting becomes fully phased in over the normal option vesting cycle currently four years the company expects that the earnings per share impact will be greater the company has a policy of repurchasing its shares to offset the dilutive impacts of stock option exercises which will be an important use of its cash flow over time during 2002 approximately 38 million was spent on such repurchases after option 15 proceeds and related tax benefits which was approximately 13 of the company’s aftertax cash flow before dividends share repurchases and the kmv acquisition the company’s 2001 spending was approximately 24 million which was approximately 9 of aftertax cash flow before dividends and share repurchases operating segments the company has historically operated in one reportable business segment – ratings which accounted for approximately 90 of the company’s total revenue with the april 2002 acquisition of kmv moody’s now operates in two reportable business segments moody’s investors service and moody’s kmv accordingly in the second quarter of 2002 the company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation in discussing periods prior to 2002 the moody’s kmv segment is referred to as moody’s risk management services “mrms” the predecessor business the moody’s investors service business consists of four rating groups — structured finance corporate finance financial institutions and sovereign risk and public finance — that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixedincome instruments in the debt markets and research which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investororiented credit research principally produced by the rating groups given the dominance of moody’s investors service to moody’s overall results the company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses nor are they allocated to the company’s business segments accordingly all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the moody’s investors service segment and none have been allocated to the moody’s kmv segment the moody’s kmv business consists of kmv acquired in april 2002 and moody’s risk management services moody’s kmv develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in creditsensitive assets credit training services and credit process software results of operations year ended december 31

ratings business with global structured finance the largest growth driver as well as strong doubledigit growth in the global research business revenue in the united states was 6803 million in 2002 an increase of 1196 million or 213 from 5607 million in 2001 excluding kmv revenue of 190 million us revenue increased 179 to 6613 million strong growth in us ratings revenue reflected higher issuance

revenue of 231 million international revenue increased 356 to 3199 million this increase was primarily driven by strong growth in revenue from structured finance ratings in europe and japan and global financial institutions international research revenue grew 36 over 2001 and the consolidation of korea investors service commencing in january 2002 also contributed to 2002 revenue growth in 2002 international revenue accounted for 34 of total moody’s revenue up from 30 in 2001 operating expenses of 2853 million in 2002 grew 191 from 2396 million in 2001 excluding 122 million related to kmv operating expenses would have been 2731 million in 2002 a 140 yearoveryear increase this increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion primarily in europe and the global structured finance business operating expense increases also included consulting costs to support new product development and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion selling general and administrative “sga” expenses of 1753 million in 2002 were up 238 versus 1416 million in 2001 included in 2002 expenses are the following charges

and excluding all other expenses of kmv totaling 197 16 million sga expenses increased 59 to 1436 million in 2002 from 1356 million in 2001 this increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion higher professional fees primarily for technology infrastructure and financial systems and higher legal fees due to us and european regulatory inquiries in addition occupancy and travel related costs increased as a result of business expansion depreciation and amortization expense increased to 246 million in 2002 from 170 million in 2001 the 2002 expense reflected 75 million of kmvrelated expenses including 63 million for amortization of acquired software and intangible assets the 2001 amount included 21 million for amortization of goodwill which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of sfas no 142 excluding these items depreciation and amortization increased by 22 million or 148 yeartoyear operating income of 5381 million in 2002 was up 350 from 3985 million in 2001 moody’s operating margin for 2002 was 526 up from 500 in 2001 the strong operating income growth in 2002 principally reflected the company’s high revenue growth without a proportional increase in expenses interest and other nonoperating expense was 207 million in 2002 compared with 166 million in 2001 the amounts primarily reflected interest expense of 228 million in each year related to moody’s 300 million of private placement debt and interest income of 23 million in 2002 compared with 65 million in 2001 the lower income in 2002 was principally due to lower interest rates and the use of cash on hand to fund the kmv acquisition and greater share repurchases moody’s effective tax rate was 442 in 2002 compared to 444 in 2001 the company expects the effective tax rate to decrease in the future as a greater portion of moody’s business migrates to lower tax jurisdictions net income was 2889 million in 2002 compared with 2122 million in 2001

credit derivatives and japan principally in commercial mortgagebacked securities corporate finance revenue was 2284 million in 2002 up 12 from 2257 million in 2001 the number of issues in the us corporate market declined about 17 in 2002 compared with the prior year reflecting continued weakness in corporate investment spending lower merger and acquisition activity and slower refinancing activity the effect of this decline on overall corporate finance revenue was tempered however by growth in bank loan ratings and relationshipbased revenue european corporate finance generated doubledigit revenue growth versus the prior year despite lower issuance volumes primarily due to new rating customers and growth in relationshipbased revenue the consolidation of korea investors service also contributed to revenue growth over the prior year revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk sector was 1574 million in 2002 an increase of 267 million or 204 from 1307 million in 2001 this reflected a 6 increase in the number of financial institutions issues in the us in 2002 compared to 2001 due to refinancing of shortterm debt to longterm debt and increased investor demand for issues in this sector in europe the number of transactions in this sector was up 17 from the prior year growth in issuer ratings and other relationshipbased revenue also contributed to the yearoveryear growth public finance revenue increased 265 to 812 million in 2002 from 642 million in 2001 yeartoyear growth of 25 in the dollar volume of us municipal bond issuance was the main driver of this performance issuance was strong for both new issues and refinancings reflecting the favorable interest rate environment as well as less payasyougo financing by municipal borrowers 17 research revenue grew 309 to 936 million in 2002 up from 715 million in 2001 increased investor focus on credit risk helped to drive higher sales of products to current customers and the addition of new customers in addition increased revenue from licensing moody’s information to thirdparty distributors contributed to the growth  moody’s investors service operating selling general and administrative expenses including corporate expenses were 3857 million in 2002 an increase of 328 million or 93 over 2001 this increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to

accounts receivable reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2002 billings it is anticipated that the majority of these receivables will be collected in the first quarter of 2003 the strength in 2002 ratings and research business volumes as well as the acquisition of kmv also resulted in an increase in deferred revenue over the prior year the increase in other liabilities in 2002 reflected increased accruals for pension and other postretirement benefits and tax exposures cash provided by operating activities in 2001 increased substantially compared with 2000 reflecting among other things a 1746 million payment made to old db in 2000 in connection with the filing of an amended tax return for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods as further described in note 14 to the company’s

million in 2000 these amounts were offset in part by proceeds from stock plans of 540 million in 2002 478 million in 2001 and 101 million in 2000 in addition dividends paid were 278 million 283 million and 72 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively net proceeds from borrowings totaled 1071 million in 2002 as described below and 1045 million in 2000 representing net proceeds from the 300 million longterm financing that was put in place at the time of the company’s spinoff from old db as described below in addition cash flow from financing activities in 2000 reflected cash distributions made to old db through the distribution date during 2002 moody’s funded the acquisition of kmv with a combination of cash on hand and shortterm borrowings from its bank credit facilities which were subsequently repaid moody’s has since borrowed under its bank credit facilities to fund share repurchases and has benefited from favorable shortterm borrowing costs management is considering pursuing longterm financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities which would result in higher financing costs at december 31 2002 moody’s had 1071 million of outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facilities in addition to the 300 million of longterm financing indebtedness in connection with the 2000 distribution moody’s was allocated 1955 million of debt at september 30 2000 moody’s funded this debt with borrowings under a 160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit on october 3 2000 the company issued 300 million of notes payable the “notes” in a private placement the cash proceeds from the notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit the notes have a fiveyear term and bear interest at an annual rate of 761 payable semiannually in the event that moody’s pays all or part of the notes in advance of their maturity the “prepaid principal” such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess if any of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments as defined in the agreement over the prepaid principal the revolving credit facility the “facility” consists of an 80 million 5year facility that expires in september 2005 and an 80 million 364day facility that expires in september 2003 as of december 31 2002 the company had borrowings outstanding of 761 million under the 5year facility bearing interest at approximately 164 per annum and 310 million under the 364day facility bearing interest at approximately 173 per annum interest on borrowings under the 5year facility is payable at rates that are based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a premium that can range from 18 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the company’s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” as defined in the related agreement at december 31 2002 such premium was 22 basis points interest on borrowings under the 364day facility is payable at rates that are based on libor plus a premium of 305 basis points the company also pays annual facility fees regardless of borrowing activity under the facility the annual fees for the 5year facility can range from 7 basis points to 125 basis points depending on the company’s ratio of total indebtedness to ebitda and were 8 basis points at december 31 2002 the annual fees for the 364day facility are 7 basis points under each facility the company also pays a utilization fee of 125 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under such facility exceeds 33 of the facility in april 2002 moody’s used the facility to initially fund a portion of the purchase price for the kmv acquisition amounts outstanding under the facility were repaid in the second quarter of 2002 since that time moody’s has borrowed under the facility to fund share repurchases 21 as noted above interest incurred under the facility for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 was 03 million 00 million and 01 million respectively the notes and the facility the “agreements” contain covenants that among other things restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries without the approval of the lenders to engage in mergers consolidations asset sales and saleleaseback transactions or to incur liens the notes and the facility also contain financial covenants that among other things require the company to maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreements of not less than 3 to 1 and a ratio of total indebtedness to ebitda as defined in the agreements of not more than 4 to 1 at december 31 2002 the company was in compliance with such covenants if an event of default were to occur as defined in the agreements and was not remedied by the company within the stipulated timeframe an acceleration of the notes and restrictions on the use of the facility could occur offbalance sheet arrangements at december 31 2002 and 2001 moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such moody’s is not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships share repurchases during october 2002 moody’s completed the 300 million share repurchase program that had been authorized by the board of directors in october 2001 on october 22 2002 the board of directors authorized an additional 450 million share repurchase program which moody’s expects to complete by mid2004 the program includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of moody’s common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the company’s employee stock plans for the year ended december 31 2002 moody’s repurchased 82 million shares at a total cost of 3699 million including 27 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans since becoming a public company in september 2000 and through the end of 2002 moody’s has repurchased 195 million shares at a total cost of 7093 million including 61 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans contractual obligations the following table presents payments due under the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2002   22 outlook certain of the statements below are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see “forwardlooking statements” on page 31 and “additional factors that may affect future results” following this section results of operations moody’s results in 2002 and 2001 including growth in revenue operating income and earnings per share have exceeded the company’s longterm financial targets which are for lowteens percent growth in moody’s investors service revenue and operating income with the impact of share repurchases and a lower effective tax rate resulting in midteens percent growth in diluted earnings per share the company anticipates that in some years its growth will exceed these targets and in other years it will be below these targets for the moody’s kmv business the company expects revenue to grow to 200 million by 2005 with an operating margin before amortization expense for acquired software and intangibles of greater than or equal to 20 moody’s is providing its outlook for 2003 at a time of significant global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty the inherent difficulty in predicting changes in the global environment and the timing of such changes creates important potential variance in the outlook in moody’s investors service moderate growth in global structured finance revenue in 2003 is anticipated despite the company’s expectation of a significant decline in the us housing sector and residential mortgage refinancings and lower growth in us consumer spending affecting assetbacked issuance in global corporate finance the company expects to see moderate overall revenue growth in 2003 despite low business investment and mergers and acquisitions activity in the us in the us public finance sector issuers will likely continue to rely on public debt to fund their budgets as tax receipts remain weak nevertheless because of an expected decline in refinancing activity the outlook for public finance revenue is modestly lower in 2003 moody’s also expects a continuation of the strong growth in the research business finally healthy growth in the moody’s kmv business is expected moody’s expenses for 2003 will likely reflect continued investment spending on enhanced ratings practices technology initiatives product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business moody’s expects a slight decline in the operating margin in 2003 compared to the very high margin level in 2002 before the impact of expensing stock options which is discussed elsewhere in this management’s discussion and analysis overall for 2003 moody’s expects that percent revenue growth will be in the midtohigh single digits with the impact of a lower effective tax rate and share repurchases the company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the low double digits before the approximate 004 per share impact of expensing compensation related to employee stock plans and the approximate 005 per share gain on the insurance recovery related to the september 11 th tragedy which is discussed in note 17 to the company’s consolidated financial statements subsequent event the company’s 2003 outlook takes into consideration the current regulatory environment both within and outside the united states including the recentlypublished sec report on rating agencies pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act which is discussed elsewhere in this management’s discussion and analysis based on management’s current assessment moody’s does not believe that regulatory action will have a material effect on the company’s 2003 outlook however changes in the competitive structure of the ratings industry possibly resulting from additional recognized rating agencies could have an effect in the future cash flow moody’s believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow as well as aftertax free cash flow for fiscal year 2003 the company currently intends to use the majority of such free cash flow to continue its share repurchase program the company’s approach to returning excess cash to shareholders by means of share repurchase is based on the current relative tax efficiency of capital gains over dividends should tax rates change and dividends become relatively more taxefficient the company would reconsider its dividend and share repurchase policies in addition as described above the company has borrowed under its bank revolving credit facility during 2002 to fund portions of the cash requirements related to the kmv acquisition and share repurchase and may obtain more permanent financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchases and other strategic opportunities 23 in addition the company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses products services and technologies the company may also be required to make future cash outlays including during 2003 to pay to new db its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis under “contingencies” these potential cash outlays might affect liquidity requirements and cause the company to pursue additional financing there can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company if at all additional factors that may affect future results the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company’s management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations if any of the following risks occur moody’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic andor global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets approximately 83 of moody’s revenue in 2002 was derived from ratings a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of creditsensitive securities in the global capital markets moody’s enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2002 that was substantially greater than its historical averages principally due to very strong growth in global structured finance issuance and strong issuance volumes in certain us sectors driven by the favorable interest rate environment the company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets therefore the company’s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or impair issuers’ ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance and other transactions for which moody’s provides ratings services in addition increases in interest rates volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment significant political or economic events defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers andor the types of creditsensitive products being offered a sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on moody’s business and financial results possible loss of market share through competition the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive moody’s competes on the basis of a number of factors including quality of ratings client service research reputation price geographic scope range of products and technological innovation moody’s faces increasing competition from sp fitch local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company in the insurance industry since moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the us it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions currently moody’s sp fitch and dominion bond rating service ltd “dbrs” are designated as nrsros by the sec in its recently released report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets the sec has indicated that it is exploring whether i there are viable alternatives to the nrsro concept in commission rules and regulations and ii whether it should permit rating agencies that cover a limited sector of the debt market or confine its activities to a limited geographic area to achieve nrsro recognition the recognition of dbrs as a nrsro occurred in february 2003 after the release of the sec’s report elimination of the nrsro concept or sec recognition of additional nrsros could result in loss of market share for moody’s introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies the markets for credit ratings research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers 24 and market participants may deem preferable to or more costeffective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody’s increased pricing pressure from competitors andor customers in the credit rating research and credit risk management markets competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service moody’s intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets however if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors moody’s may lose market share possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled experienced analysts and other professionals competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense and moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than moody’s moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis moody’s ability to effectively compete will continue to depend among other things on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees exposure to litigation related to moody’s rating opinions moody’s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions in addition as moody’s international business expands these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the us such as the first amendment these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time potential emergence of governmentsponsored credit rating agencies when governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be negatively affected governmentmandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness in these circumstances issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating which may negatively affect the company proposed us foreign state and local legislation and regulations including those relating to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in the us and other countries the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve recently there has been discussion in the us regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies in october 2002 the staff of the senate committee on governmental affairs issued a report that recommended changes in sec regulation of rating agencies in january 2003 the sec released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets the report considers a number of issues that the sec was required to examine under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other issues arising from a secinitiated review of credit rating agencies in the report the sec stated that it intends to publish a concept release in early 2003 to solicit comments on a number of issues affecting the role and operation of credit rating agencies and thereafter to propose rules in response to those comments at present moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec’s ongoing review implementation guidelines proposed by the committee of european securities regulators under the european commission’s market abuse directive are applicable to many participants in the european capital markets including credit rating agencies depending on the form in which they are ultimately adopted such implementation guidelines may increase moody’s cost of doing business in europe and the legal risk associated with such business 25 multinational operations moody’s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the us operations in several different countries expose moody’s to a number of legal economic and regulatory risks such as  although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations of the company any of these factors could have such an effect in the future contingencies from time to time moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation that are incidental to the company’s business including claims based on ratings assigned by moody’s management periodically assesses the company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available for those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements in other instances because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability if any as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly based on its review of the latest information available in the opinion of management the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on moody’s financial position results of operations or cash flows subject to the contingencies described below discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to old db its predecessors and their affiliated companies “legacy contingencies” and those that relate to moody’s business and operations “moody’s matters” legacy contingencies to understand the company’s exposure to the potential liabilities described below it is important to understand the relationship between moody’s and new db and the relationship among new db and its predecessors and other parties who through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters in november 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation through a spinoff separated into three separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation acnielsen corporation “acnielsen” and cognizant corporation “cognizant” the “1996 distribution” in june 1998 the dun  bradstreet corporation through a spinoff separated into two separate public companies the dun  bradstreet corporation and rh donnelley corporation “donnelley” the “1998 distribution” during 1998 cognizant through a 26 spinoff separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated “ims health” and nielsen media research inc “nmr” in september 2000 the dun  bradstreet corporation “old db” through a spinoff separated into two separate public companies new db and moody’s as further described in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements description of business and basis of presentation information resources inc in 1996 information resources inc “iri” filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york naming as defendants the corporation then known as the dun  bradstreet corporation ac nielsen company a subsidiary of acnielsen and ims international inc a subsidiary of the company then known as cognizant at the time of the filing of the complaint each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of the dun  bradstreet corporation the complaint alleges various violations of united states antitrust laws including purported violations of sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act the complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship these claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of survey research group limited “srg” iri alleges srg violated an alleged agreement with iri when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced srg to breach that agreement iri’s complaint alleges damages in excess of 350 million which amount iri asked to be trebled under antitrust laws iri also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount discovery in this case is ongoing and no trial date has been set in connection with the 1996 distribution cognizant acnielsen and the dun  bradstreet corporation entered into an indemnity and joint defense agreement the “indemnity and joint defense agreement” pursuant to which they have agreed i to certain arrangements allocating potential liabilities “iri liabilities” that may arise out of or in connection with the iri action and ii to conduct a joint defense of such action in particular the indemnity and joint defense agreement provides that acnielsen will assume exclusive liability for iri liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities if any become payable the “acn maximum amount” and that the dun  bradstreet corporation and cognizant will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the acn maximum amount the acn maximum amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that acnielsen is able to pay after giving effect to i any plan submitted by such investment bank that is designed to maximize the claimspaying ability of acnielsen without impairing the investment banking firm’s ability to deliver a viability opinion but which will not require any action requiring shareholder approval and ii payment of related fees and expenses for these purposes financial viability means the ability of acnielsen after giving effect to such plan the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the acn maximum amount to pay its debts as they become due and to finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business as reconstituted by such plan for two years from the date any such plan is expected to be implemented in 2001 acnielsen merged with vnu nv pursuant to the indemnity and joint defense agreement vnu is to be included with acnielsen for purposes of determining the acn maximum amount and vnu assumed acnielsen’s liabilities under that agreement in connection with the 1998 distribution old db and donnelley entered into an agreement the “1998 distribution agreement” whereby old db assumed all potential liabilities of donnelley arising from the iri action and agreed to indemnify donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities as a result of their 1998 separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement ims health and nmr are each jointly and severally liable for all cognizant liabilities under the indemnity and joint defense agreement in 1999 nmr was acquired by vnu nv and vnu assumed nmr’s liabilities under the indemnity and joint defense agreement under the terms of the 2000 distribution new db undertook to be jointly and severally liable with moody’s for old db’s obligations to donnelley under the 1998 distribution agreement including any liabilities arising under the indemnity and joint defense agreement however as between themselves each of new db and moody’s will be responsible for 50 of any payments to be made with respect to the iri action pursuant to the 1998 distribution agreement including legal fees or expenses related thereto management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the iri action or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect moody’s results of operations cash flows or financial position as such no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the company 27 legacy tax matters old db and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business including through taxfree restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities pursuant to a series of agreements as between themselves ims health and nmr are jointly and severally liable to pay onehalf and new db and moody’s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half of any payments for taxes penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable irs rulings on certain tax matters excluding the matter described below as “amortization expense deductions” for which new db and moody’s are solely responsible and certain other potential tax liabilities after new db andor moody’s pays the first 137 million which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as “utilization of capital losses” in connection with the 2000 distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related distribution agreement new db and moody’s have between themselves agreed to each be financially responsible for 50 of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations without limiting the generality of the foregoing three specific tax matters are discussed below royalty expense deductions during the second quarter of 2002 new db received a notice of proposed adjustment from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993 in this notice the irs proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old db on its 1994 1995 and 1996 tax returns new db disagrees with the position taken by the irs in its notice and filed a responsive brief to this effect with the irs in addition the irs recently indicated that it may assess penalties on this matter if the irs were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the notice and including penalties and were to prevail in its position then new db would be required to pay the assessment if new db were to challenge the assessment in us district court rather than in us tax court then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge should any such payments be made by new db then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 distribution agreement moody’s would have to pay to new db its 50 share the company estimates that its share of the required payment to the irs could be up to approximately 55 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability in a related matter new db has received a preliminary summary report from the irs stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established and reallocate to old db income and expense items that had been claimed on the partnership tax return for 1996 if the irs were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the report and were to prevail in this matter then new db would be required to pay the assessment if new db were to challenge the assessment in us district court rather than in us tax court then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge moody’s estimates that its share of the exposure to the irs for this matter could be up to approximately 46 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph amortization expense deductions the irs has requested from new db documentation with respect to a transaction executed in 1997 that could result in amortization expense deductions from 1997 through 2012 it is possible that the irs could ultimately challenge these deductions and that new db could make payments to the irs related to previously claimed deductions in that event moody’s would be required to pay to new db its 50 share of new db’s payments to the irs in addition should new db discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns moody’s would be required to repay to new db an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50 share of the related future tax benefits new db had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to moody’s at the distribution date management estimates that the company’s current potential exposure related to this matter is 89 million including penalties and interest and net of tax benefits this exposure could increase by approximately 3 million to 6 million per year depending on actions that the irs may take with respect to assessments and on whether new db continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns utilization of capital losses the irs has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990 on june 26 2000 the irs as part of its audit process issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and old db 28 responded by filing a petition for a refund in the us district court on september 21 2000 after the payments described below were made on may 12 2000 an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods which reflected 5616 million of tax and interest due old db paid the irs approximately 3493 million of this amount on may 12 2000 50 of such payment was allocated to moody’s and had previously been accrued by the company ims health informed old db that it paid to the irs approximately 2123 million on may 17 2000 the payments were made to the irs to stop further interest from accruing and new db is contesting the irs’ assessment new db has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts if any in excess of the amounts paid with the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence moody’s does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to irs assessments for this matter if the irs were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter moody’s estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes penalties and interest net of tax benefits on this matter would be approximately 5 million subsequent to making its may 2000 payment to the irs ims health sought partial reimbursement from nmr under their 1998 distribution agreement the “imsnmr agreement” nmr paid ims health less than the amount sought by ims health under the imsnmr agreement and in 2001 ims health filed an arbitration proceeding against nmr to recover the difference ims health sought to include old db in this arbitration arguing that if nmr should prevail in its interpretation of the imsnmr agreement then ims health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against old db neither old db nor any of its predecessors was a party to the imsnmr agreement a decision from the arbitration panel is expected in 2003 if nmr should prevail in the arbitration against ims health and in turn ims health should prevail against old db then the company believes that the additional liability of old db would be approximately 15 million net of tax benefits under the terms of the 2000 distribution moody’s and new db would each be responsible for onehalf of such amount or approximately 75 million the company believes that the claim asserted against old db by ims health is without merit as such no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements summary of moody’s exposure to three legacy tax matters the company has considered the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and believes that it has adequate reserves recorded in its consolidated financial statements for its probable exposures in these matters however it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the company has reserved which could result in material charges to moody’s future reported results in addition the cash outlays resulting from these matters which the company currently estimates could be as much as 202 million could be material and could increase with time as described above such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in may 2000 concerning utilization of capital losses moody’s matters l’association francaise des porteurs d’ emprunts russes on june 20 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by l’association francaise des porteurs d’ emprunts russes “afper” against moody’s france sa a subsidiary of the company and filed in the court of first instance of paris france in this suit afper a group of holders of bonds issued by the russian government prior to the 1917 bolshevik revolution makes claims against moody’s france sa and standard  poor’s sa for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of russia and russian debt since 1996 afper alleges that by failing to take into account the postrevolutionary repudiation of prerevolutionary czarist debt by the soviet government in rating russia and new issues of russian debt beginning in 1996 the rating agencies enabled the russian federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the czarist government alleging joint and several liability afper seeks damages of euro 28 billion approximately us 29 billion as of december 31 2002 plus legal costs moody’s believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action as such no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the company dividends since the fourth quarter of 2000 the company has paid a quarterly dividend of 45 cents per share of moody’s common stock resulting in dividends paid per share of 180 cents in 2002 and 2001 and 45 cents in 2000 prior to the fourth quarter of 2000 when moody’s was a subsidiary of
