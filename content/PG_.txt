the company has in place compliance programs and internal and external experts to help guide our business in complying with these and other existing laws and regulations that apply to us around the globe and we have made and plan to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with these laws and regulations we also expect that our many suppliers consultants and other third parties working on our behalf share our commitment to compliance and we have policies and procedures in place to manage these relationships though they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over operations and governance we do not expect that the company’s expenditures for compliance with current government regulations including current environmental regulations will have a material effect on our total capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in fiscal year 2023 as compared to prior periods

 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k as well as in our quarterly and annual reports current reports on form 8k press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors except to the extent required by law forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends perhaps materially 

macroeconomic conditions and related financial risks 

our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of having significant operations and sales in international markets including foreign currency fluctuations currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility 

we are a global company with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in approximately 180 countries and territories around the world we hold assets incur liabilities generate sales and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar and our operations outside the us generate more than fifty percent of our annual net sales fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have and could continue to reduce the us dollar value of sales earnings and cash flows we receive from nonus markets increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those markets negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely 

impact our business results or financial condition further we have a significant amount of foreign currency debt and derivatives as part of our capital markets activities the maturity cash outflows of these instruments could be adversely impacted by significant appreciation of foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro which could adversely impact our overall cash flows moreover discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could adversely affect our results see also the results of operations and cash flow financial condition and liquidity sections of the mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

we also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange import authorization pricing or other controls or restrictions such as nigeria turkey argentina and egypt our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas or if new or increased tariffs quotas exchange or price controls trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business 

additionally our business operations or employees have been and could continue to be adversely affected including by the need to deconsolidate or even exit certain businesses in particular countries by political volatility labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions including political instability or upheaval or acts of war such as the russiaukraine war and the related government and other entity responses broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of local governments particularly in emerging markets 

uncertain economic or social conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship which could adversely impact our business 

our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local regional or global economic or social disruptions these disruptions have included and may in the future include a slowdown recession or inflationary pressures in the general economy reduced market growth rates tighter credit markets for our suppliers vendors or customers a significant shift in government policies significant social unrest the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions including potential negative consumer sentiment toward nonlocal products or sources or the inability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers vendors and suppliers additionally these and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers distributors contractors or other thirdparty partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

4 the procter  gamble company 

customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles in addition if we are unable to generate sufficient sales income and cash flow it could affect the company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments 

disruptions in credit markets or to our banking partners or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit or overall liquidity 

a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition we rely on toptier banking partners in key markets around the world who themselves face economic societal political and other risks for access to credit and to facilitate collection payment and supply chain finance programs a disruption to one or more of these toptier partners could impact our ability to draw on existing credit facilities or otherwise adversely affect our cash flows or the cash flows of our customers and vendors 

changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results 

changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results results of elections referendums sanctions or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies laws and regulations may change including with respect to sanctions taxes tariffs import and export controls and the general movement of goods services capital and people between countries and other matters the potential implications of such uncertainty which include among others exchange rate fluctuations new or increased tariffs trade barriers and market contraction could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

the war between russia and ukraine has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and financial results 

the war between russia and ukraine has negatively impacted and the situation it generates may continue to negatively impact our operations beginning in march 2022 the company reduced its product portfolio discontinued new capital investments and suspended media advertising and promotional activity in russia future impacts to the company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty as to how the overall situation will evolve within ukraine there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities our distribution centers or those of our customers we may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to 

our customers within russia we may reduce further or discontinue our operations due to sanctions and export controls and countersanctions monetary currency or payment controls restrictions on access to financial institutions supply and transportation challenges or other circumstances and considerations ultimately these could result in loss of assets or impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or writedowns of other operating assets and working capital 

the war between russia and ukraine could also amplify or affect the other risk factors set forth in this part i item 1a including but not limited to foreign exchange volatility disruptions to the financial and credit markets energy supply and supply chain disruptions increased risks of an information security or operational technology incident cost fluctuations and commodity cost increases and increased costs to ensure compliance with global and local laws and regulations the occurrence of any of these risks combined with the increased impact from the war between russia and ukraine could adversely impact our business and financial results 

more broadly there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales earnings and cash flows should the situation worsen including among other potential impacts economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures energy and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of europe 

business operations risks 

our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain 

our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements including for issues such as labor disputes or controversies loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites discontinuity or disruptions in our internal information and data systems or those of our suppliers inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials including water recycled materials and materials that meet our labor standards significant changes in trade policy natural disasters increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise acts of war or terrorism disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control have at times interrupted and could in the future interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities including certain petroleumderived materials like resins and paperbased 

the procter  gamble company 5 

materials like pulp and raw and packaging materials and the costs of labor transportation including trucks and containers energy pension and healthcare inflation pressures could also result in increases in these input costs therefore our business results depend in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost saving projects and sourcing decisions while maintaining and improving margins and market share failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows 

the ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels 

the consumer products industry is highly competitive across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends including pricing promotional incentives product delivery windows and trade terms in addition evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics which for example may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models particularly ecommerce and mobile or social commerce applications could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows 

a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we sell most of our products via retail customers which include mass merchandisers ecommerce including social commerce channels grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores distributors wholesalers specialty beauty stores including airport dutyfree stores highfrequency stores pharmacies electronics stores and professional channels our success depends on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers private label brands and generic nonbranded products or for other 

reasons significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the companys reputation and the reputation of our brands form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies including consumers customers and suppliers the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall productrelated litigation defects or impurities in our products product misuse changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients negative perceptions of packaging such as plastic and other petroleum based materials lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts concerns about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices privacy lapses or data breaches allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products additionally negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about safety quality ingredients efficacy environmental or social impacts or similar matters sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer our company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility strong communities equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability while the company has many programs and initiatives to further these goals our ability to achieve these goals is impacted in part by the actions and efforts of third parties including local and other governmental authorities suppliers vendors and customers if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity the companys reputation and results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our thirdparty relationships and the agreements under which our thirdparty partners operate our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted further failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the 

6 the procter  gamble company 

company and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and financial results additionally while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our financial legal reputational and operational risk 

a significant information security or operational technology incident including a cybersecurity breach or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems networks hardware processes andor associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information and operational technology itot systems networks and services including internet and intranet sites data hosting and processing facilities and technologies physical security systems and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms many of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business the various uses of these itot systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

• ordering and managing materials from suppliers 

• converting materials to finished products 

• shipping products to customers 

• marketing and selling products to consumers 

• collecting transferring storing andor processing customer consumer employee vendor investor and other stakeholder information and personal data including such data from persons covered by an expanding landscape of privacy and data regulations such as citizens of the european union who are covered by the general data protection regulation gdpr residents of california covered by the california consumer privacy act ccpa citizens of china covered by the personal information protection law pipl and citizens of brazil covered by the general personal data protection law lgpd 

• summarizing and reporting results of operations including financial reporting 

• managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms 

• hosting processing and sharing as appropriate confidential and proprietary research business plans and financial information 

• collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications 

• complying with regulatory legal and tax requirements 

• providing data security and 

• handling other processes necessary to manage our business 

numerous and evolving information security threats including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats pose a 

risk to the security of our services systems networks and supply chain as well as to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations in addition because the techniques tools and tactics used in cyberattacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack 

our itot databases and systems and our thirdparty providers’ databases and systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing social engineering hacking and other cyberattacks such attacks may originate from outside parties hackers criminal organizations or other threat actors including nation states in addition insider actorsmalicious or otherwisecould cause technical disruptions andor confidential data leakage we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our thirdparty providers will prevent material breaches operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our thirdparty providers’ itot databases or systems 

a breach of our data security systems or failure of our itot databases and systems may have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results if the itot systems networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations or if we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations or inadvertent disclosure of lack of integrity of or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes including catastrophic events natural disasters power outages computer and telecommunications failures improper data handling viruses phishing attempts cyberattacks malware and ransomware attacks security breaches security incidents or employee error or malfeasance and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and be exposed to reputational competitive operational financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action if our critical it systems or backup systems or those of our thirdparty vendors are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them 

in addition if a ransomware attack or other cybersecurity incident occurs either internally or at our thirdparty technology service providers we could be prevented from accessing our data or systems which may cause interruptions or delays in our business operations cause us to incur remediation costs subject us to demands to pay a ransom or damage our reputation in addition such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our partners our employees customers and suppliers additionally we could 

the procter  gamble company 7 

be exposed to potential liability litigation governmental inquiries investigations or regulatory enforcement actions and we could be subject to payment of fines or other penalties legal claims by our suppliers customers or employees and significant remediation costs 

periodically we also upgrade our itot systems or adopt new technologies if such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures it could affect our ability to order materials make and ship orders and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues the costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we must successfully manage the demand supply and operational challenges associated with the effects of a disease outbreak including epidemics pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns 

our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak epidemic pandemic or similar widespread public health concern such as travel restrictions or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities as a result of the covid19 virus the threat of the virus or the emergence of any variants these impacts include but are not limited to 

• significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products which may be caused by among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products or stockpiling or similar pantryloading activity if prolonged such impacts can further increase the difficulty of business or operations planning and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

• inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by constrained workforce capacity or the loss or disruption of other essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components transportation or other manufacturing and distribution capability 

• failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners to meet their obligations to the company or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations 

• periods of disruption that limit the ability to access the financial markets or which increase the cost of liquidity or 

• significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines importexport restrictions price controls or governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the company their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as thirdparty actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects in the case of covid19 the emergence of variants may continue to occur across regions and countries where we operate leading to varied government responses and the potential for decreased vaccine effectiveness resulting in further volatility and disparity in our results and operations across geographies 

business strategy  organizational risks 

our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation evolving digital marketing and selling platforms and changing consumer habits  

we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products achieving our business results depends in part on successfully developing introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends to obtain maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others and to continue to deliver efficient and effective marketing across evolving media and mobile platforms with dynamic and increasingly more restrictive privacy requirements we must also successfully respond to technological advances made by and intellectual property rights granted to competitors customers and vendors failure to continually innovate improve and respond to competitive moves platform evolution and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we must successfully manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities 

8 the procter  gamble company 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against our business objectives specifically our financial results have been and in the future could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures our results of operations and cash flows have been and in the future could also be impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities if 1 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 2 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges which could also result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change including attracting and retaining key talent as part of our overall succession planning 

our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings including staffing adjustments and employee departures failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings while continuing to invest in business growth could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows additionally successfully executing organizational change management transitions at leadership levels of the company and motivation and retention of key employees is critical to our business success factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation competition from other employers and availability of qualified individuals our success depends on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans 

legal  regulatory risks 

we must successfully manage compliance with current and expanding laws and regulations as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property product liability product composition or formulation packaging content or corporate responsibility after consumer purchase marketing antitrust and competition privacy data protection environmental including increasing focus on the climate water and waste impacts of consumer packaged goods companies operations 

and products employment healthcare antibribery anticorruption trade including tariffs sanctions and export controls tax accounting and financial reporting or other matters in addition increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental social and governance esg matters including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change waste production water usage human capital labor and risk oversight could expand the nature scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control assess and report these and other rapidly changing laws regulations policies and related interpretations as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies create challenges for the company including our compliance and ethics programs may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws regulations policies and related interpretations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results additionally we are currently and in the future may be subject to a number of inquiries investigations claims proceedings and requests for information from governmental agencies or private parties the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business failure to successfully manage these new or pending regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows furthermore if new or pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

changes in applicable tax laws and regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

the company is subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the various tax laws can and do occur for example in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the us tax act the changes included in the us tax act were broad and complex under the current us presidential administration comprehensive federal income tax reform has been proposed including an increase in the us federal corporate income tax rate elimination of certain investment incentives and a more than doubling of us residual taxation of nonus earnings while these proposals are controversial likely to change during the legislative process and may prove difficult to enact as proposed in the current closely divided us congress their impact could nonetheless be significant 

additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are subject to potential evolution an outgrowth of the original base erosion and profit shifting beps project is a project undertaken by the approximately 

the procter  gamble company 9

while it is too early to assess the overall impact of these potential changes as these and other tax laws and related regulations are revised enacted and implemented our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted 

furthermore we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities while we believe our tax positions will be sustained the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 beauty brands transaction with coty may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows

global economic conditions our products are sold in numerous countries across north america europe latin america asia and africa with more than half our sales generated outside the united states as such we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors us and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations global economic conditions continue to be volatile due to the covid19 pandemic resulting in market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic and any causes of market size contraction such as greater political unrest or instability in the middle east central and eastern europe including the ongoing russiaukraine war certain latin american markets the hong kong market in greater china and the korean peninsula could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows 

changes in costs our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices transportation costs other broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts we have significant exposures to certain commodities in particular certain oilderived materials like resins and paperbased materials like pulp volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs disruptions in our manufacturing supply and distribution operations including energy shortages port congestions labor constraints and freight container and truck shortages have impacted our costs and could do so in the future if we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through

consistent productivity improvements it may adversely impact our gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows net sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products we strive to implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plans including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization if we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes there could be a negative impact on our gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows 

foreign exchange we have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the us dollar as their functional currency transaction exposures relate to 1 the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2 the revaluation of transactionrelated working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in the past three years a number of foreign currencies have weakened versus the us dollar leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts certain countries that recently had and are currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include argentina turkey brazil and russia these fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical net sales costs and net earnings and could do so in the future increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products which would negatively affect our net sales gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows 

government policies our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in us or foreign government legislative regulatory or enforcement policies for example our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in us or nonus tax policy or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work being led by the oecd for the g20 focused on addressing the challenges of the digitalization of the economy the breadth of the oecd project extends beyond pure digital businesses and if agreed and enacted by most countries is likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly establishing a 15 minimum tax on their foreign operations our net sales gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in us and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters additionally we attempt to carefully manage our debt currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange import authorization and pricing controls such as nigeria turkey argentina and egypt further our net sales gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to 

international trade agreements in north america and elsewhere changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows 

covid19 pandemic because we sell products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales net earnings and cash flows 

however the continued evolution of the pandemic may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or regions it could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products due to governmental actions or key material transportation and labor shortages impacting our ability to produce and ship products or could impact consumers’ movements and access to our products there could also be reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking particularly in home cleaning health and hygiene products as economic activity resumes following slowdowns or relaxation of governmental restrictions net the uncertainty in the timing and extent of demand volatility the relaxation and reimplementation of movement restrictions the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking the future economic trends due to a resurgence of positive cases and governmental actions in response to the pandemic may result in heightened volatility and negative impacts to net sales net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic 

while we have been able to broadly maintain our operations we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements key material and labor shortages and transportation constraints we intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee safety measures to minimize disruption to the manufacturing and distribution of our products the continued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with regards to the disruptions caused either by resurgence of positive cases or governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations for example the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials 

the pandemic has not had a material negative impact on the company’s liquidity position we continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our shortterm liquidity needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short and longterm credit ratings 

russiaukraine war  the war between russia and ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries our ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites we have approximately 500 employees including both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing personnel our operations in ukraine accounted for less than 1 of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022 additionally net assets of our ukraine subsidiary along 

the procter  gamble company 19 

with ukraine related assets held by other subsidiaries account for less than 1 of net assets as of june 30 2022 

our russia business includes two manufacturing sites with a net book value of approximately 350 million as of june 30 2022 we have approximately 2400 employees including both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing personnel in fiscal 2022 our operations in russia accounted for less than 2 of consolidated net sales and less than 1 of net earnings additionally net assets of our russia subsidiaries along with russia related assets held by other subsidiaries account for less than 2 of net assets as of june 30 2022 beginning in march 2022 the company has reduced its product portfolio discontinued new capital investments and suspended media advertising and promotional activity in russia 

future impacts to the company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty as to how the war will evolve what its duration will be and its ultimate resolution within ukraine there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities we may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers ultimately these could result in impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or writedowns of other operating assets and working capital 

within russia we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at current levels due to sanctions and countersanctions monetary currency or payment controls restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges our suppliers distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products 

more broadly there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope including among other potential impacts economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of europe

results of operations 

the key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales gross margin selling general and administrative costs sga operating margin other nonoperating items income taxes and net earnings the primary factors driving yearoveryear changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete product initiatives competitive activities the level of initiatives pricing and other activities by competitors marketing spending retail executions both instore and online and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as our pricing actions which can also impact volume changes in product and 

geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the us 

for most of our categories our cost of products sold and sga are variable in nature to some extent accordingly our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute yearoveryear changes in total costs the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs energy and other commodities pricing impacts geographic mix for example gross margins in north america are generally higher than the company average for similar products product mix for example the beauty segment has higher gross margins than the company average foreign exchange rate fluctuations in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments for example product or package improvements and to a lesser extent scale impacts for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature the primary components of sga are marketingrelated costs and nonmanufacturing overhead costs marketingrelated costs are primarily variable in nature although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies while overhead costs are variable to some extent we generally experience more scalerelated impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth the main drivers of changes in sga as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings reinvestments for example increased advertising inflation foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts

operating costs 



gross margin decreased 380 basis points to 474 of net sales in fiscal 2022 the decrease in gross margin was due to 

• 390 basis points of increased commodity costs 

• a 130 basispoint decline from unfavorable mix due primarily to negative product mix resulting from the launch and growth of premiumpriced products that are profitaccretive but have lower than companyaverage gross margin and 

• 40 basis points of net manufacturing cost increases as 60 basis points of increased transportation costs and 20 basis points of product and packaging investments were partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings net of inflation and other cost increases 

these impacts were partially offset by a 180 basispoint increase due to higher pricing 

total sga decreased 4 to 202 billion due to decreased overhead costs marketing spending and other operating costs sga as a percentage of net sales decreased 240 basis points to 252 primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and to a lesser extent a decrease in overhead costs and marketing spending

nonoperating items 

• interest expense was 439 million in fiscal 2022 a decrease of 63 million versus the prior year driven primarily by lower average interest rates on fixed rate debt 

• interest income was 51 million in fiscal 2022 an increase of 6 million versus the prior year 

• other nonoperating income increased 484 million to 570 million due primarily to a prior year loss on earlydebt extinguishment and a current year increase in net nonoperating benefits on postretirement benefit plans partially offset by unrealized gains on equity investments in the prior year and unrealized losses on equity investments in the current year 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate decreased 70 basis points to 178 in 2022 due to 

• a 45 basispoint decrease from higher excess tax benefits of sharebased compensation a 200 basispoint benefit in the current year versus a 155 basispoint benefit in the prior year 

• a 30 basispoint decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions 35 basispoint favorable impact in the current year versus a 5 basispoint favorable impact in the prior year and 

• a 15 basispoint decrease from higher current year deductions for foreignderived intangible income versus prior year 

these decreases were partially offset by a 20 basispoint increase due to unfavorable geographic mix impacts of current year earnings 

net earnings 

operating income decreased 1 or 02 billion to 178 billion as the increase in net sales was more than fully offset by the decrease in operating margin both of which are discussed above 

earnings before income taxes increased 2 or 04 billion to 180 billion as the decrease in operating income was more than fully offset by a prior year loss on earlydebt extinguishment and lower interest expense net earnings increased 3 or 04 billion to 148 billion due to the increase in earnings before income taxes and the decrease in the effective income tax rate discussed above foreign

restructuring program to deliver productivity and cost savings 

the company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of 250 to 500 million savings generated from the companys 

restructuring program are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activities the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment in fiscal 2022 the company incurred before tax restructuring costs within the range of our historical annual ongoing level of 250 to 500 million 

restructuring accruals of 147 million as of june 30 2022 are classified as current liabilities approximately 65 of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2022 either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuringtype activities the resulting charges are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting 

in addition to our restructuring programs we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins 

cash flow financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses brands and geographies as necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

cash flow analysis 



operating cash flow 

operating cash flow was 167 billion in 2022 a 9 decrease versus the prior year net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets generated approximately 176 billion of operating cash flow working capital and other impacts used 918 million of operating cash flow as summarized below 

• an increase in accounts receivable used 694 million of cash primarily due to sales growth the number of days 

the procter  gamble company 25 

sales outstanding increased approximately 1 day versus prior year 

• higher inventory used 12 billion of cash due to business growth and increased safety stock levels to strengthen supply chain sufficiency amidst business growth and commodity cost increases inventory days on hand increased approximately 1 day primarily due to these same factors 

• accounts payable accrued and other liabilities generated 14 billion of cash accounts payable increased in line with the increase in inventory and to a lesser extent the impact of extended payment terms with suppliers see extended payment terms and supply chain financing below partially offset by lower marketing spending days payable outstanding increased approximately 1 day versus prior year due to these same factors 

• other net operating assets and liabilities used 406 million of cash primarily driven by the current portion of transitional tax payments due related to the us tax act and pension related contributions partially offset by other impacts 

adjusted free cash flow we view adjusted free cash flow as an important nongaap measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investments it is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the us tax act adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their atrisk compensation 

adjusted free cash flow was 138 billion in 2022 a decrease of 13 versus the prior year the decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flows as discussed above adjusted free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings was 93 in 2022 

extended payment terms and supply chain financing beginning in fiscal 2014 in response to evolving market practices the company began a program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers at the same time the company initiated a supply chain finance program the scf with a number of global financial institutions the scf banks under the scf qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from the company to a scf bank these participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the respective scf bank while the company is not party to those agreements the scf banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize the company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs this generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own the company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the scf and reaches an agreement with an scf bank they elect which individual company invoices they sell to the scf bank however all the company’s payments to participating suppliers are paid to the scf bank on the 

invoice due date regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the scf bank the scf bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold to the scf bank under the scf 

the terms of the company’s payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the scf our payment terms with our suppliers for similar services and materials within individual markets are consistent between suppliers that elect to participate in the scf and those that do not participate accordingly our average days outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included in the scf in addition the scf is available to both material suppliers where the underlying costs are largely included in cost of goods sold and to service suppliers where the underlying costs are largely included in sga as of june 30 2022 approximately 3 of our global suppliers have elected to participate in the scf payments to those suppliers during fiscal year 2022 total approximately 15 billion which equals approximately 25 of our total cost of goods sold and sga for the year for participating suppliers we believe substantially all of their receivables with the company are sold to the scf banks accordingly we would expect that at each balance sheet date a similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be payable to scf banks all outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the scf are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows as of june 30 2022 and 2021 the amount due to suppliers participating in the scf and included in accounts payable were approximately 6 billion and 5 billion respectively 

although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could increase at a slower rate in fiscal 2023 future changes in our suppliers’ financing policies or economic developments such as changes in interest rates general market liquidity or the company’s creditworthiness relative to participating suppliers could impact suppliers’ participation in the scf andor our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers however any such impacts are difficult to predict

liquidity 

at june 30 2022 our current liabilities exceeded current assets by 114 billion largely due to shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs as of june 30 2022 the company had 58 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries primarily in various western european and asian countries we did not have material cash and cash equivalents related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds under current law we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future 

we utilize short and longterm debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchases we have strong short and longterm debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets in addition we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that if needed should provide sufficient funding to meet shortterm financing requirements 

on june 30 2022 our shortterm credit ratings were p1 moodys and a1 standard  poors while our longterm credit ratings were aa3 moodys and aa standard  poors all with a stable outlook 

we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an 80 billion facility split between a 32 billion fiveyear facility and a 48 billion 364day facility which expire in november 2026 and november 2022 respectively both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn these credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers nor do they have material adverse events clauses except at the time of signing in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities for additional details on debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity

contractual commitments 

the following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of june 30 2022 

1 represents the us federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the us tax act 

2 represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements these future pension payments assume the company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements considering the current economic environment in which the company operates the company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements the projected payments beyond fiscal year 2025 are not currently determinable 

3 primarily reflects future contractual payments under various takeorpay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business commitments made under takeorpay obligations represent minimum commitments with suppliers and are in line with expected usage this includes service contracts for information technology human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced while the amounts listed represent contractual obligations we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity in such cases we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties resulting in a reduced payment the amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not takeorpay arrangements such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position 



significant accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include revenue recognition income taxes certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company 

the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership risks and rewards transfer which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer trade promotions consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances instore merchandising funds advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons are offered through various programs to customers and consumers sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation based 

on contractual terms sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates the actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates these differences which have historically not been significant are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgements and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards and our ability to uphold certain tax positions 

realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods which involves business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational differences with the respective

governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment 

a core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities in the jurisdictions where those functions are performed however because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various crossborder transactions we have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty we estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70 of our global earnings we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties considering changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have several audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are several estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the companys income taxes 

employee benefits 

we sponsor various postretirement benefits throughout the world these include pension plans both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefit oprb plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and oprb plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations as permitted by us gaap the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline 

basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary oprb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for 2022 the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and oprb assets was 55 and 84 respectively a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and oprb assets would impact annual aftertax benefitexpense by approximately 125 million 

since pension and oprb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses discount rates used for our us defined benefit pension and oprb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan for our international plans the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 37 represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 135 million the average discount rate on the oprb plan of 50 reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the us which is where most of the plan participants receive benefits a 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual aftertax oprb expense by approximately 10 million see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our defined benefit pension and oprb plans 

goodwill and intangible assets 

significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations we typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets the valuations used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions overall category growth rates competitive activities cost containment and margin progression company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows 

indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months ended december 31 assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of 

the procter  gamble company 29 

capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions for example future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in addition changes to or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses 

we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible is less than its carrying value that difference represents an impairment 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands other acquired intangible assets eg certain brands all customer relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives an impairment assessment for determinablelived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 

most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that at a minimum exceed three times their underlying carrying values certain of our goodwill reporting units in particular shave care and appliances are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high as our legacy businesses the appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value 

based on our annual impairment testing during the three months ended december 31 2021 the shave care reporting units fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 30 and the gillette indefinitelived intangible assets fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 

the most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates including residual growth rates and discount rate the residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorterterm business planning period the residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected longterm category market growth rates the residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates the competitive environment inflation relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share as a result the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth grooming habit changes devaluation of currencies against the us dollar or an increased competitive environment the discount rate which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant is based upon industry required rates of return including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors such as further devaluation of currencies against the us dollar spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the us another key assumption in our fair value determination of the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset is the royalty rate which is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying gillette business the royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in longterm operating margins 

while management can and has implemented strategies to address these events in the past changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the shave care reporting units goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the duration and severity of the pandemic and the russiaukraine war could result in a slowdown or a recession or drive inflationary pressures or foreign currency devaluations in the general economy these could trigger additional future impairment charges for the shave care reporting unit goodwill and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset while we have concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended june 30 2022 the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk our assessment of the gillette intangible asset assumes the net sales growth rates will continue to recover from the impact of the pandemic there continues to be a high level of uncertainty relating to geopolitical and macroeconomic factors as a result of the russiaukraine war and the covid19 pandemic accordingly there 

30 the procter  gamble company 

continues to be risk related to this key assumption the continued evolution of the pandemic and the russiaukraine war could impact the assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by more prolonged reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products which may be caused by among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other travel restrictions financial hardship changes in the use and frequency of grooming products or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or by disruption in the supply chain or operations due to the evolving russiaukraine war in addition relative global and countryregional macroeconomic factors including the russiaukraine war could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the us dollar finally the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital as of june 30 2022 the carrying values of the shave care goodwill and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset were 123 billion and 141 billion respectively 

we performed a sensitivity analysis for the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset during our annual impairment testing utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorterterm and residual growth rates the discount rate and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values the table below provides in isolation the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our shorterterm and residual growth rates or a 50 basis point decrease in our royalty rate some of which would result in an impairment of the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset 

in light of the russiaukraine war we performed an additional sensitivity analysis for the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset for a range of outcomes including reduced future cash flows and no future cash flows in ukraine and russia under these scenarios the shave care reporting unit fair value continued to exceed its carrying value by approximately 30 and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset’s fair value exceeded or approximated its carrying value however if 

the impact of the war were to extend beyond its current scope there could be a triggering event for the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset that may cause us to perform an additional impairment assessment for that asset in a future period that may result in an impairment charge

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

as a multinational company with diverse product offerings we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices we evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting we leverage the companys diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments to the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations as discussed below we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities these financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument types and other hedging practices see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments 

derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk modeling the tests for interest rate currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the riskmanager™ valueatrisk model using a oneyear horizon and a 95 confidence level the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposures move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics™ dataset as of june 30 2022 in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetrics™ a reasonable proxy is included 

our market risk exposures relative to interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as discussed below have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period in addition we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term 

interest rate exposure on financial instruments interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on 

the procter  gamble company 31 

our investments in foreign operations these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the companys foreign net investments 

based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june 30 2022 including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates we believe a nearterm change in interest rates at a 95 confidence level based on historical interest rate movements would not materially affect our financial statements 

currency rate exposure on financial instruments because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months 

based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june 30 2022 we believe at a 95 confidence level based on historical currency rate movements the impact on such instruments of a nearterm change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements 

commodity price exposure on financial instruments we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors we may use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 

as of and during the years ended june 30 2022 and june 30 2021 we did not have any financial commodity hedging activity

2 the procter  gamble company 

promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with our sales force we believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products product quality performance value and packaging are also important differentiating factors 

government regulation  our company is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business in the united states many of our products and manufacturing operations are subject to one or more federal or state regulatory agencies including the us food and drug administration fda the environmental protection agency epa the occupational safety and health administration osha the federal trade commission ftc and the consumer product safety commission cpsc we are also subject to anticorruption laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and antitrust and competition laws and regulations that govern our dealings with suppliers customers competitors and government officials 

in addition many foreign jurisdictions in which we do business have regulations and regulatory bodies that govern similar aspects of our operations and products in some cases to an even more significant degree we are also subject to expanding laws and regulations related to environmental protection nonfinancial reporting and diligence labor and employment trade taxation and data privacy and protection including the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr and similar regulations in states within the united states and in countries around the world for additional information on the potential impacts of global legal and regulatory requirements on our business see “item 1a risk factors” herein 

the company has in place compliance programs and internal and external experts to help guide our business in complying with these and other existing laws and regulations that apply to us around the globe and we have made and plan to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with these laws and regulations we also expect that our many suppliers consultants and other third parties working on our behalf share our commitment to compliance and we have policies and procedures in place to manage these relationships though they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over operations and governance we do not expect that the company’s expenditures for compliance with current government regulations including current environmental regulations will have a material effect on our total capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in fiscal year 2022 as compared to prior periods 

human capital  our employees are a key source of competitive advantage and their actions guided by our purpose values and principles pvps are critical to the long term success of our business as of june 30 2021 the company had approximately 101000 employees an increase of two percent versus the prior year due primarily to business growth the total number of employees is an estimate of total company employees excluding interns coops contractors and employees of joint ventures as of june 

30 2021 49 of our employees are in manufacturing roles and 26 of our employees are located in the united states 

we focus on attracting developing and retaining skilled diverse talent including recruiting from among the best universities across the markets in which we compete and are generally able to select from the top talent we focus on developing our employees by providing a variety of job experiences training programs and skill development opportunities our employees’ holistic growth and full engagement is particularly important as we primarily have a developfromwithin model for staffing our senior leadership positions we aim to retain our talented employees by offering competitive compensation and benefits strong career development and a respectful and inclusive culture that provides equal opportunity for all

our compensation plans are based on the principles of paying for performance paying competitively versus peer companies that we compete with for talent and in the marketplace and focusing on longterm success through a combination of shortterm and longterm incentive plans we also offer competitive benefit programs including retirement plans and health insurance in line with local country practices with flexibility to accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce 




 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k as well as in our quarterly and annual reports current reports on form 8k press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors except to the extent required by law forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in 

the procter  gamble company 3 

conjunction with managements discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends perhaps materially 

macroeconomic conditions and related financial risks 

our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets including foreign currency fluctuations currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility 

we are a global company with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world we hold assets incur liabilities generate sales and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar and our operations outside the us generate more than fifty percent of our annual net sales fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have and could continue to reduce the us dollar value of sales earnings and cash flows we receive from nonus markets increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those markets negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition further we have a significant amount of foreign currency debt and derivatives as part of our capital markets activities the maturity cash outflows of these instruments could be adversely impacted by significant appreciation of foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro which could adversely impact our overall cash flows moreover discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could adversely affect our results see also the results of operations and cash flow financial condition and liquidity sections of the mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

we also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange import authorization pricing or other controls or restrictions such as nigeria algeria egypt argentina and turkey our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas or if new or increased tariffs quotas exchange or price controls trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business 

additionally our business operations or employees have been and could continue to be adversely affected including by the need to deconsolidate or even exit certain businesses in particular countries by political volatility labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual 

countries or regions including political instability or upheaval broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of local governments particularly in emerging markets 

uncertain economic or social conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship which could adversely impact our business 

our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local regional or global economic or social disruptions these disruptions have included and may in the future include a slowdown or recession in the general economy reduced market growth rates tighter credit markets for our suppliers vendors or customers a significant shift in government policies significant social unrest the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions including potential negative consumer sentiment toward nonlocal products or sources or the inability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers vendors and suppliers additionally these and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers distributors contractors or other thirdparty partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles in addition if we are unable to generate sufficient sales income and cash flow it could affect the company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments 

disruptions in credit markets or to our banking partners or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit or overall liquidity 

a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition we rely on toptier banking partners in key markets around the world who themselves face economic societal political and other risks for access to credit and to facilitate collection and payment programs a disruption to one or more of these toptier partners could impact our ability to draw on existing credit facilities or otherwise adversely affect our cash flows 

changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results 

changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results results of elections referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products 

4 the procter  gamble company 

are manufactured sold or distributed such as the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies laws and regulations may change including with respect to sanctions taxes tariffs import and export controls and the general movement of goods services capital and people between countries and other matters the potential implications of such uncertainty which include among others exchange rate fluctuations new or increased tariffs trade barriers and market contraction could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

business operations risks 

our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain 

our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements including for issues such as labor disputes or controversies loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites discontinuity or disruptions in our internal information and data systems inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials including water recycled materials and materials that meet our labor standards significant changes in trade policy natural disasters increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise acts of war or terrorism disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control have at times interrupted and could in the future interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities including certain petroleumderived materials like resins and paperbased materials like pulp and raw and packaging materials and the costs of labor transportation including trucks and containers energy pension and healthcare inflation pressures could also result in increases in these input costs therefore our business results depend in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost saving projects and sourcing decisions while maintaining and improving margins and market share failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows 

the ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels 

the consumer products industry is highly competitive across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the 

environments in which we operate which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends including pricing promotional incentives product delivery windows and trade terms in addition evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics which for example may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models particularly ecommerce and mobile or social commerce applications could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows 

a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we sell most of our products via retail customers which include mass merchandisers ecommerce grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores distributors wholesalers specialty beauty stores including airport dutyfree stores highfrequency stores pharmacies electronics stores and professional channels our success depends on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers private label brands and generic nonbranded products or for other reasons significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the companys reputation and the reputation of our brands form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies including consumers customers and suppliers the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall productrelated litigation defects or impurities in our products product

misuse changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients negative perceptions of packaging such as plastic and other petroleum based materials lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts concerns about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices privacy lapses or data breaches allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products additionally negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about safety quality ingredients efficacy environmental or social impacts or similar matters sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer our company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility strong communities equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity the companys reputation and results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our thirdparty relationships and the agreements under which our thirdparty partners operate our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted further failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the company and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and financial results additionally while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our financial legal reputational and operational risk 

a significant information security or operational technology incident including a cybersecurity breach or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems networks hardware processes andor associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information and operational technology itot systems networks and services including internet and intranet sites data hosting and processing facilities and technologies physical security systems and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms many of which are managed 

hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business the various uses of these itot systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

• ordering and managing materials from suppliers 

• converting materials to finished products 

• shipping products to customers 

• marketing and selling products to consumers 

• collecting transferring storing andor processing customer consumer employee vendor investor and other stakeholder information and personal data including such data from persons covered by an expanding landscape of privacy and data regulations such as citizens of the european union who are covered by the gdpr or residents of california covered by the california consumer privacy act ccpa 

• summarizing and reporting results of operations including financial reporting 

• managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms 

• hosting processing and sharing as appropriate confidential and proprietary research business plans and financial information 

• collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications 

• complying with regulatory legal and tax requirements 

• providing data security and 

• handling other processes necessary to manage our business 

numerous and evolving information security threats including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats pose a risk to the security of our services systems networks and supply chain as well as to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations in addition because the techniques tools and tactics used in cyberattacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack 

our itot databases and systems and our thirdparty providers’ databases and systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing social engineering hacking and other cyberattacks such attacks may originate from outside parties hackers criminal organizations or other threat actors including nation states in addition insider actorsmalicious or otherwisecould cause technical disruptions andor confidential data leakage we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our thirdparty providers will prevent material breaches operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our thirdparty providers’ itot databases or systems 

6 the procter  gamble company 

a breach of our data security systems or failure of our itot databases and systems may have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results if the itot systems networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations or if we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations or inadvertent disclosure of lack of integrity of or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes including catastrophic events natural disasters power outages computer and telecommunications failures improper data handling viruses phishing attempts cyberattacks malware and ransomware attacks security breaches security incidents or employee error or malfeasance and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and be exposed to reputational competitive operational financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action if our critical it systems or backup systems or those of our thirdparty vendors are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them 

in addition if a ransomware attack or other cybersecurity incident occurs either internally or at our thirdparty technology service providers we could be prevented from accessing our data or systems which may cause interruptions or delays in our business operations cause us to incur remediation costs subject us to demands to pay a ransom or damage our reputation in addition such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our partners our employees customers and suppliers additionally we could be exposed to potential liability litigation governmental inquiries investigations or regulatory enforcement actions and we could be subject to payment of fines or other penalties legal claims by our suppliers customers or employees and significant remediation costs 

periodically we also upgrade our itot systems or adopt new technologies if such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures it could affect our ability to order materials make and ship orders and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues the costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we must successfully manage the demand supply and operational challenges associated with the effects of a disease outbreak including epidemics pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns 

our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak epidemic pandemic or similar widespread public health concern such 

as travel restrictions or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to selfquarantine as a result of the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic these impacts include but are not limited to 

• significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products which may be caused by among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products or stockpiling or similar pantryloading activity if prolonged such impacts can further increase the difficulty of business or operations planning and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

• inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by constrained workforce capacity or the loss or disruption of other essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components transportation or other manufacturing and distribution capability 

• failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners to meet their obligations to the company or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations or 

• significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines importexport restrictions price controls or governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the company their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as thirdparty actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects in the case of covid19 the availability and public acceptance of effective vaccines has initially varied and may continue to vary significantly across regions and countries where we operate leading to further volatility and disparity in our results and operations across geographies

business strategy  organizational risks 

our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation evolving digital marketing and selling platforms and changing consumer habits  

we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products achieving our business results depends in part on successfully developing introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends to obtain maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others and to continue to deliver efficient and effective marketing across evolving media and mobile platforms with dynamic privacy requirements we must also successfully respond to technological advances made by and intellectual property rights granted to competitors customers and vendors failure to continually innovate improve and respond to competitive moves platform evolution and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we must successfully manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against our business objectives specifically our financial results have been and in the future could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures our results of operations and cash flows have been and in the future could also be impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities if 1 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 2 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges which could also result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change including attracting and retaining key talent as part of our overall succession planning 

our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings while continuing to invest in business growth could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

additionally successfully executing organizational change management transitions at leadership levels of the company and motivation and retention of key employees is critical to our business success factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation competition from other employers and availability of qualified individuals our success depends on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans 

legal  regulatory risks 

we must successfully manage compliance with current and expanding laws and regulations as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property product liability product composition or formulation packaging content or endoflife responsibility marketing antitrust and competition privacy data protection environmental including increasing focus on the climate water and waste impacts of consumer packaged goods companies operations and products employment healthcare antibribery anticorruption trade including tariffs sanctions and export controls tax accounting and financial reporting or other matters in addition increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental social and governance esg matters including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change waste production water usage human capital labor and risk oversight could expand the nature scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control assess and report these and other rapidly changing laws regulations policies and related interpretations as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies create challenges for the company including our compliance and ethics programs may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws regulations policies and related interpretations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results additionally we are currently and in the future may be subject to a number of inquiries investigations claims proceeding and requests for information from governmental agencies or private parties the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business failure to successfully manage these new or pending regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may

materially adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows furthermore if new or pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

changes in applicable tax laws and regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

the company is subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the various tax laws can and do occur for example in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the us tax act the changes included in the us tax act were broad and complex under the current us presidential administration comprehensive federal income tax reform has been proposed including an increase in the us federal corporate income tax rate elimination of certain investment incentives and a more than doubling of us residual taxation of nonus earnings while these proposals are controversial likely to change during the legislative process and may prove difficult to enact as proposed in the current closely divided us congress their impact could nonetheless be significant 

additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are subject to potential evolution an outgrowth of the original base erosion and profit shifting beps project is a project undertaken by the more than 130 member countries of the expanded oecd inclusive framework focused on addressing the challenges of the digitalization of the economy the breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights in market countries and establishing a global minimum tax 

while it is too early to assess the overall impact of these potential changes as these and other tax laws and related regulations are revised enacted and implemented our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted 

furthermore we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities while we believe our tax positions will be sustained the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 beauty brands transaction with coty may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows

global economic conditions our products are sold in numerous countries across north america europe latin america asia and africa with more than half our sales generated outside the united states as such we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors us and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations current global economic conditions continue to be highly volatile due to the covid19 pandemic resulting in market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic and any causes of market size contraction such as greater political unrest or instability in the middle east central  eastern europe certain latin american markets and the hong kong market in greater china could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin in either case reducing our net earnings and cash flows 

changes in costs our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices transportation costs and our own productivity efforts we have significant exposures to certain commodities in particular certain oilderived materials like resins and paperbased materials like pulp and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs disruptions in our manufacturing supply and distribution operations including freight container and truck availabilities due to the covid19 pandemic may also impact our costs if we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements it may adversely impact our gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows net sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products we strive to implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plans including outsourcing projects supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization if we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes there could be a negative impact on our gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows 

foreign exchange we have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the us dollar as their functional currency transaction exposures relate to 1 the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2 the revaluation of transactionrelated working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in the past three fiscal years a number of foreign currencies have weakened versus the us dollar leading to lower earnings from these foreign exchange impacts in the current fiscal year foreign exchange impacts have benefited net sales while negatively impacting earnings due to the mix of currencies in which input costs are denominated certain countries currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include argentina brazil russia turkey as well as the european union these fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical net sales costs and net earnings and could do so in the future increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products which would affect our net sales gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows 

government policies our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in us or foreign government legislative regulatory or enforcement policies for example any future legislative or regulatory changes in us or nonus tax policy or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work being led by the oecd for the g20 focused on addressing the challenges of the digitalization of the economy the breadth of the oecd project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jurisdictional taxation rights our net sales gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in us and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters additionally we attempt to carefully manage our debt currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange import authorization and pricing controls such as nigeria algeria egypt argentina and turkey further our net sales gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in north america and elsewhere including any changes related to the united kingdoms exit from the european union changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows 

covid19 pandemic disclosures our net sales net earnings and cash flows may be impacted by the us and foreign government policies to manage the covid19 pandemic such as movement restrictions or site closures the company’s priorities during the covid19 pandemic continue to be protecting the health and safety of our

employees maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health hygiene and cleaning needs and using our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges because the company sells products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers the covid19 pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales as positive and negative impacts during fiscal 2021 have largely offset each other we have experienced a significant increase in demand and consumption of certain of our product categories fabric home cleaning and hygiene products primarily in north america caused in part by changing consumer habits pantry stocking and retailer inventory replenishment due to the covid19 pandemic contributing to increases in net sales at the same time net sales have been negatively impacted due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movements in certain markets in asia pacific and europe in certain channels such as professional and in certain categories such as shave care in the future the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment demand in certain countries in latin america asia pacific and imea may be particularly susceptible to recession it could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products due to government actions impacting our ability to produce and ship products or impacting consumers’ movements and access to our products the resumption of normal economic activity as we emerge from the pandemic in certain markets including north america could also result in reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking particularly in home cleaning and hygiene products we believe that over the long term there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate particularly our products that deliver essential health hygiene and cleaning benefits however the timing and extent of demand recovery in certain markets in asia pacific imea and latin america the resumption of international travel the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking and product demand volatility caused by future economic trends are unclear accordingly there may be heightened volatility in net sales net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic our retail customers are also being impacted by the pandemic their success in addressing the issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to and as a result sales of our products 

our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain the company has endeavored to follow actions recommended by governments and health authorities including on vaccine administration to protect our employees worldwide with particular measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities we have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of the majority of our products while we have been able to broadly maintain our operations we experienced some disruption in our 

supply chain in certain markets in asia pacific and imea in the first months of the pandemic due primarily to the restriction of employee movements as well as increased transportation and manufacturing costs we intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement our employee safety measures to ensure that we continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the pandemic however uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain for example a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials that could impact our operations 

because the pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our operations on the demand for our products or the resulting net sales and net earnings it has also not negatively impacted the company’s liquidity position we continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our shortterm liquidity needs and we continue to maintain access to the capital markets enabled by our strong short and longterm credit ratings we have also not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the covid19 pandemic

results of operations 

the key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales gross margin selling general and administrative costs sga operating margin other nonoperating items income taxes and net earnings the primary factors driving yearoveryear changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete product initiatives competitive activities the level of initiatives pricing and other activities by competitors marketing spending retail executions both instore and online and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as our pricing actions which can also impact volume changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the us 

most of our cost of products sold and sga are to some extent variable in nature accordingly our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute yearoveryear changes in total costs the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs energy and other commodities pricing impacts geographic mix for example gross margins in north america are generally higher than the company average for similar products product mix for example the beauty segment has higher gross margins than the company average foreign exchange rate fluctuations in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments for example product or package improvements and to a lesser 

the procter  gamble company 19 

extent scale impacts for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature the primary components of sga are marketingrelated costs and nonmanufacturing overhead costs marketingrelated costs are primarily variable in nature although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies while overhead costs are variable to some extent we generally experience more scalerelated impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth the main drivers of changes in sga as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings reinvestments for example increased advertising inflation foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts

corporate 



corporate includes certain operating and nonoperating activities not allocated to specific business segments these include the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level financing and investing activities certain employee benefit costs other general corporate items gains and losses related to certain divested brands certain asset impairment charges and certain restructuringtype activities to maintain a competitive cost structure including manufacturing and workforce optimization corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the reportable segments to us gaap the most significant ongoing reconciling item is income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall company effective tax rate 

corporate net sales increased 12 to 441 million in fiscal 2021 due to an increase in the net sales of the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level corporate net loss increased by 153 million in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the 427 million 512 million before tax current period charge for early debt extinguishment excluding this charge corporate had net earnings of 40 million an improvement of 274 million driven by lower restructuring charges versus the base period and the current period unrealized gain from an equity investment that became publicly traded in fiscal 

2021 partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income in the current period each of these items have been discussed above 

restructuring program to deliver productivity and cost savings 

the company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of 250 to 500 million in fiscal 2012 the company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan in addition to our ongoing restructuringtype activities to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain research and development marketing and overheads in fiscal 2017 the company communicated specific elements of an additional multiyear productivity and cost savings program the plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining decision making manufacturing and other work processes to both fund the companys growth strategy and increase the companys operating margin the plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2020 with spending totaling approximately 782 million in that year 

savings generated from the companys restructuring program are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activities the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment however we estimate that the underlying restructuring costs incurred since 2012 approximately 82 billion along with other nonmanufacturing enrollment reductions since 2012 have delivered approximately 37 billion in annual beforetax gross savings in fiscal 2021 the company incurred restructuring costs within the range of our historical ongoing level of 250 to 500 million annually 

restructuring accruals of 278 million as of june 30 2021 are classified as current liabilities approximately 91 of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2021 either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuringtype activities the resulting charges are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting 

in addition to our restructuring programs we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins 

refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the operating costs section of the mda for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts 

cash flow financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends other discretionary uses include share repurchases and 

the procter  gamble company 25 

acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses brands and geographies as necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

cash flow analysis 



operating cash flow 

operating cash flow was 184 billion in 2021 a 6 increase from the prior year net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization loss on early extinguishment of debt sharebased compensation deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets generated approximately 179 billion of operating cash flow working capital and other impacts generated 506 million of operating cash flow as summarized below 

• an increase in accounts receivable used 342 million of cash primarily due to sales growth and lower relative sales at the end of the base period in certain markets due to covid19 the number of days sales outstanding increased approximately 1 day versus prior year 

• higher inventory used 309 million of cash primarily due to commodity cost increases and business growth inventory days on hand increased approximately 2 days primarily due to these same factors 

• accounts payable accrued and other liabilities increased generating 14 billion of cash about half of this was driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers see extended payment terms and supply chain financing below the remaining amount was driven by higher current period marketing spending and to support the increase in inventory days payable outstanding is approximately 87 days as of june 30 2021 an increase of 6 days versus prior year due to these same factors 

• other net operating assets and liabilities declined using 369 million of cash primarily driven by the payment of the current year portion of transitional taxes due related to the us tax act repatriation charge 225 million and pension related accruals and contributions 

adjusted free cash flow we view adjusted free cash flow as an important nongaap measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investments it is defined as operating cash flow less capital 

expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the us tax act and tax payments related to the merck acquisition adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their atrisk compensation 

adjusted free cash flow was 158 billion in 2021 an increase of 6 versus the prior year the increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above adjusted free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the charges for early debt extinguishment which are not considered part of our ongoing operations was 107 in 2021 

extended payment terms and supply chain financing beginning in fiscal 2014 in response to evolving market practices the company began a program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers at the same time the company initiated a supply chain finance program the scf with a number of global financial institutions the scf banks under the scf qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from the company to a scf bank these participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the respective scf bank while the company is not party to those agreements the scf banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize the company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs this generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own the company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the scf and reaches an agreement with an scf bank they elect which individual company invoices they sell to the scf bank however all the company’s payments to participating suppliers are paid to the scf bank on the invoice due date regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the scf bank the scf bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold to the scf bank under the scf 

the terms of the company’s payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the scf our payment terms with our suppliers for similar services and materials within individual markets are consistent between suppliers that elect to participate in the scf and those that do not participate accordingly our average days outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included in the scf in addition the scf is available to both material suppliers where the underlying costs are largely included in cost of goods sold and to service suppliers where the underlying costs are largely included in sga as of june 30 2021 approximately 3 of our global suppliers have elected to participate in the scf payments to those suppliers during fiscal year 2021 total approximately 15 billion which equals approximately 26 of our total cost of goods sold and sga for the period for participating suppliers we believe substantially all of their receivables with the 

26 the procter  gamble company 

company are sold to the scf banks accordingly we would expect that at each balance sheet date a similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be payable to scf banks all outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the scf are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows as of june 30 2021 and 2020 the amount due to suppliers participating in the scf and included in accounts payable were approximately 5 billion and 4 billion respectively 

although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could increase at a slower rate in fiscal 2022 future changes in our suppliers’ financing policies or economic developments such as changes in interest rates general market liquidity or the company’s creditworthiness relative to participating suppliers could impact suppliers’ participation in the scf andor our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers however any such impacts are difficult to predict 

investing cash flow 

net investing activities used 28 billion in cash in 2021 primarily due to capital spending net investing activities generated 30 billion in cash in 2020 mainly due to proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities partially offset by capital spending 

capital spending capital expenditures primarily to support capacity expansion innovation and cost efficiencies were 28 billion in 2021 and 31 billion in 2020 capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points to 37 in 2021 

acquisitions acquisition activity used cash of 34 million in 2021 primarily related to a minor health care acquisition acquisition activity used 58 million in 2020 primarily related to final contractual payments from the fiscal 2019 acquisition of merck otc along with a minor baby care acquisition 

proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales proceeds from asset sales were 42 million in 2021 primarily from fixed asset sales and a minor brand divestiture and 30 million in 2020 primarily from a minor brand divestiture 

investment securities investments used net cash of 55 million in 2021 primarily from the purchase of investment securities and generated 62 billion in 2020 primarily from sales and maturities of investment securities 

financing cash flow 

net financing activities consumed 215 billion of cash in 2021 mainly due to treasury stock purchases dividends to shareholders and net debt reductions partially offset by the impact of proceeds received from stock option exercises net financing activities consumed 84 billion in cash in 2020 mainly due to treasury stock purchases and dividends to 

shareholders partially offset by a net debt increase and the impact of stock options 

dividend payments our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments dividends per common share increased 7 to 32419 per share in 2021 total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were 83 billion in 2021 and 78 billion in 2020 in april 2021 the board of directors declared a 10 increase in our quarterly dividend from 07907 to 08698 per share on common stock and series a and b esop convertible class a preferred stock this is the 65th consecutive year that our dividend has increased we have paid a dividend for 131 consecutive years every year since our incorporation in 1890 

longterm and shortterm debt we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital total debt was 320 billion as of june 30 2021 and 347 billion as of june 30 2020 we used 39 billion for net debt reductions including 512 million for early debt extinguishment costs related to the early retirement of 23 billion of debt in 2020 we generated 48 billion from net debt increases primarily due to the issuance of bonds of 50 billion 

treasury purchases total share repurchases were 110 billion in 2021 and 74 billion in 2020 

impact of stock options and other the exercise of stock options and other financing activities generated 16 billion and 20 billion of cash in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

liquidity 

at june 30 2021 our current liabilities exceeded current assets by 100 billion largely due to shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs as of june 30 2021 the company had 47 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries primarily in various western european and asian countries we did not have material cash and cash equivalents related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds under current law we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future 

we utilize short and longterm debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchases we have strong short and longterm debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets in addition we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that if needed should provide sufficient funding to meet shortterm financing requirements 

the procter  gamble company 27 

on june 30 2021 our shortterm credit ratings were p1 moodys and a1 standard  poors while our longterm credit ratings were aa3 moodys and aa standard  poors all with a stable outlook 

we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an 80 billion facility split between a 32 billion fiveyear facility and a 48 billion 364day facility which expire in november 2025 and november 2021 respectively both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn these credit facilities do not have 

crossdefault or ratings triggers nor do they have material adverse events clauses except at the time of signing in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities for additional details on debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 



contractual commitments 

the following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of june 30 2021 



1 represents the us federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the us tax act does not include any provisions made for foreign withholding taxes on expected repatriations as the timing of those payments is uncertain 

2 as of june 30 2021 the companys consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of 803 million including 176 million of interest and penalties due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of june 30 2021 cannot be made 

3 represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements these future pension payments assume the company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements considering the current economic environment in which the company operates the company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements the projected payments beyond fiscal year 2023 are not currently determinable 

4 primarily reflects future contractual payments under various takeorpay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business commitments made under takeorpay obligations represent minimum commitments with suppliers and are in line with expected usage this includes service contracts for information technology human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced while the amounts listed represent contractual obligations we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity in such cases we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties resulting in a reduced payment the amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not takeorpay arrangements such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position

significant accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include revenue recognition income taxes certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company 

the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a 

single point in time when ownership risks and rewards transfer which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer trade promotions consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances instore merchandising funds advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons are offered through various programs to customers and consumers sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation based on contractual terms sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates the actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates these differences which have historically not been significant are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgements and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards and our ability to uphold certain tax positions 

realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods which involves business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to 

successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment 

a core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities in the jurisdictions where those functions are performed however because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various crossborder transactions we have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty we estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70 of our global earnings we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the companys income taxes 

employee benefits 

we sponsor various postretirement benefits throughout the world these include pension plans both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefit oprb plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and oprb plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations as permitted by us gaap the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service 

the procter  gamble company 29 

cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary oprb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for 2021 the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and oprb assets was 65 and 84 respectively a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and oprb assets would impact annual aftertax benefitexpense by approximately 140 million 

since pension and oprb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses discount rates used for our us defined benefit pension and oprb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan for our international plans the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 17 represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 210 million the average discount rate on the oprb plan of 32 reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the us which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits a 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual aftertax oprb expense by approximately 15 million see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our defined benefit pension and oprb plans 

goodwill and intangible assets 

significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations we typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets the valuations used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions overall category growth rates competitive activities cost containment and margin progression company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows 

indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months 

ended december 31 assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions for example future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in addition changes to or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses 

we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible is less than its carrying value that difference represents an impairment 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands other acquired intangible assets eg certain brands all customer relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives an impairment assessment for determinablelived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 

most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that at a minimum exceed two times their underlying carrying values certain of our goodwill reporting units in particular shave care and appliances are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high as our legacy businesses the appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value 

during fiscal 2019 a noncash before and aftertax impairment charge of 68 billion was recognized to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill for the shave care reporting unit and a noncash beforetax impairment charge 

30 the procter  gamble company 

of 16 billion 12 billion aftertax was recognized to reduce the carrying amount of the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset to its fair value the underlying reductions in fair values were due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the us dollar a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits primarily in the developed markets and an increased competitive market environment in the us and certain other markets as a result of the fiscal 2019 impairment determined by the step two testing that existed under previous accounting standards the shave care fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 20 as of june 30 2019 because the impairment testing for intangible assets has historically been a onestep process the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value at that date 

during our annual impairment testing during the quarter ended december 31 2019 we reduced the discount rate used in the valuation based on developments in the macroeconomic environment as a result of this change and updates to other underlying cash flow projections the shave care fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 20 and the gillette indefinitelived intangible assets fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 

the covid19 pandemic that originated during the second half of fiscal 2020 resulted in a reduction in shave incidents by consumers and a weakening of certain currencies relative to the us dollar which led to a reduction in net sales for gillettebranded products this resulted in a triggering event for the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset which caused us to perform an additional impairment assessment for that asset as of june 30 2020 that assessment indicated that the fair value of the gillette trade name approximated its carrying value accordingly no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended june 30 2020 based on our annual impairment testing during the three months ended december 31 2020 the shave care reporting units fair value continued to exceed its carrying value by more than 20 and the gillette indefinitelived intangible assets fair value continued to approximate its carrying value 

the most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates including residual growth rates and discount rate the residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorterterm business planning period the residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected longterm category market growth rates the residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates the competitive environment inflation relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share as a result the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth grooming habit changes devaluation of currencies 

against the us dollar or an increased competitive environment the discount rate which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant is based upon industry required rates of return including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors such as further devaluation of currencies against the us dollar spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the us another key assumption in our fair value determination of the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset is the royalty rate which is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying gillette business the royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in longterm operating margins 

while management can and has implemented strategies to address these events in the past changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the shave care reporting units goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

the duration and severity of the pandemic could result in additional future impairment charges for the shave care reporting unit goodwill and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset while we have concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended june 30 2021 the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk our assessment of the gillette intangible asset assumes the net sales growth rates will begin to recover from the impact of the pandemic during the next fiscal year there continues to be a high level of uncertainty relating to how the pandemic will evolve how governments and consumers will react and progress on the distribution of vaccines accordingly there continues to be risk related to this key assumption a more prolonged pandemic recovery period could impact the assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by more prolonged reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products which may be caused by among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other travel restrictions financial hardship changes in the use and frequency of grooming products or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products in addition relative global and countryregional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the us dollar finally the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of 

the procter  gamble company 31 

capital as of june 30 2021 the carrying values of the shave care goodwill and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset were 128 billion and 141 billion respectively 

we performed a sensitivity analysis for the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset during our annual impairment testing utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorterterm and residual growth rates the discount rate and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values the table below provides in isolation the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate a 25 basis point decrease in our shorterterm and residual growth rates or a 50 basis point decrease in our royalty rate any of which in isolation would result in an impairment of the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset

commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the riskmanager™ valueatrisk model using a oneyear horizon and a 95 confidence level the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposures move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics™ dataset as of june 30 2021 in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetrics™ a reasonable proxy is included 

our market risk exposures relative to interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as discussed below have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period in addition we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term 

interest rate exposure on financial instruments interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the companys foreign net investments 

based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june 30 2021 including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates we believe a nearterm change in interest rates at a 95 confidence level based on historical interest rate movements would not materially affect our financial statements 

currency rate exposure on financial instruments because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months 

based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june 30 2021 we believe at a 95 confidence level based on historical currency rate movements the impact on such instruments of a nearterm change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements 

commodity price exposure on financial instruments we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors we may use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 

as of and during the years ended june 30 2021 and june 30 2020 we did not have any financial commodity hedging activity

measures not defined by us gaap 

in accordance with the secs regulation sk item 10e the following provides definitions of the nongaap measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related gaap measures we believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends ie trends excluding nonrecurring or unusual items and results and provide a supplemental measure of yearonyear results the nongaap measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes these measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their atrisk compensation these nongaap measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related gaap measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results these nongaap measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted these measures include 

organic sales growth organic sales growth is a nongaap measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions divestitures and foreign exchange from yearoveryear comparisons we believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for atrisk compensation 

the following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth 



1 acquisition  divestiture impactother includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales 

adjusted free cash flow adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending tax payments related to the merck otc consumer healthcare acquisition in 2020 and transitional tax payments resulting from the us tax act in 2021 and 2020 the company incurred a transitional tax liability of approximately 38 billion from the us tax act which is payable over a period of 8 years adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion we view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investments 

the following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow  millions 



1 adjustments to operating cash flow include transitional tax payments resulting from the us tax act of 225 and 215 in 2021 and 2020 respectively and tax payments related to the merck acquisition of 328 in 2020 

adjusted free cash flow productivity adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the charges for early debt extinguishment which are not considered part of our ongoing operations we view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand pg’s ability to generate cash adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes this measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for atrisk compensation the companys longterm target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent 

the following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity  millions

core eps core eps is a measure of the companys diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated management views this nongaap measure as a useful supplemental measure of company performance over time core eps is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for atrisk compensation the table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to core eps including the following reconciling items 

• charges for early debt extinguishment during fiscal year 2021 the company recorded after tax charges of 427 million 512 million before tax due to the early extinguishment of certain longterm debt these charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished 

• incremental restructuring the company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately 250  500 million before tax beginning in fiscal 2012 the company had a strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that resulted in incremental restructuring charges through fiscal 2020 the adjustment to core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above the normal recurring level of restructuring costs in fiscal 2021 the company incurred restructuring costs within our historical ongoing level 

we do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of yearonyear results these items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their atrisk compensation

narrative description of business 

business model  our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products as well as the creation of new innovative products and brands the markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories through numerous channels as well as directtoconsumer our growth strategy is to deliver meaningful and noticeable superiority in all elements of our consumer proposition  product packaging brand communication retail execution and consumer and customer value equation we use our research and development and consumer insights to provide superior products and packaging we utilize our marketing and online presence to deliver superior brand messaging to our consumers we work collaboratively with our customers to deliver superior retail execution both instore and online in conjunction with the above elements we provide superior value to consumers and our retail customers in each price tier 

in which we compete productivity improvement is also critical to delivering our objectives of balanced top and bottomline growth and value creation 

key product categories  information on key product categories can be found in the mda and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

key customers  our customers include mass merchandisers ecommerce grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores distributors wholesalers baby stores specialty beauty stores including airport dutyfree stores highfrequency stores pharmacies electronics stores and professional channels these customers sell our products to individual consumers we also sell direct to consumers sales to walmart inc and its affiliates represent approximately 15 of our total sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 no other customer represents more than 10 of our total sales our top ten customers accounted for approximately 38 of our total sales in 2020 and 36 in 2019 and 2018 the nature of our business does not result in material backlog orders or contracts with the government we believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete 

sources and availability of materials  almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the company are purchased from third parties some of whom are singlesource suppliers we produce certain raw materials primarily chemicals for further use in the manufacturing process in addition fuel natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing processes and in the transportation of input materials and finished products to customers the prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation when prices for these items change we may or may not pass the change to our customers the company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials none of which are material to our business taken as a whole 

trademarks and patents  we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products the trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products all major trademarks in each business are registered in part our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks patents and licenses 

competitive condition  the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies including wellknown global competitors in many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers privatelabel brands we are well positioned in 

2 the procter  gamble company 

the industry segments and markets in which we operate often holding a leadership or significant market share position we support our products with advertising promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with our sales force we believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products product quality performance value and packaging are also important differentiating factors 

expenditures for environmental compliance  expenditures for compliance with federal state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the company no material change is expected in fiscal year 2021 

employees  as of june 30 2020 the company had approximately 99000 employees an increase of two percent versus the prior year due to business growth and insourcing of certain media planning and other services the total number of employees is an estimate of total company employees excluding interns coops contractors and employees of joint ventures the number of employees includes manufacturing and nonmanufacturing employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k as well as in our quarterly and annual reports current reports on form 8k press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors except to the extent required by law forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends perhaps materially 

our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets including foreign currency fluctuations currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility 

we are a global company with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries 

and territories around the world we hold assets incur liabilities generate sales and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar and our operations outside the us generate more than fifty percent of our annual net sales fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have and could continue to reduce the us dollar value of sales earnings and cash flows we receive from nonus markets increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those markets negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition moreover discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could adversely affect our results see also the results of operations and cash flow financial condition and liquidity sections of the mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

we also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange import authorization pricing or other controls or restrictions such as nigeria algeria argentina egypt and turkey our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas or if new or increased tariffs quotas exchange or price controls trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business 

additionally our business operations or employees have been and could continue to be adversely affected by political volatility labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions including political instability or upheaval broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of local governments particularly in emerging markets 

uncertain economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship which could adversely impact our business 

our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local regional or global economic disruptions these disruptions have included and may in the future include a slowdown or recession in the general economy reduced market growth rates tighter credit markets for our suppliers vendors or customers a significant shift in government policies the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions including potential negative consumer sentiment toward nonlocal products or sources or the inability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers vendors and suppliers additionally these and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers distributors contractors or other thirdparty partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome resulting in their inability to provide us with the 

the procter  gamble company 3 

materials and services we need in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles in addition if we are unable to generate sufficient sales income and cash flow it could affect the company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments 

disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit 

a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital 

our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain 

our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements including for issues such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites discontinuity in our internal information and data systems inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials significant changes in trade policy natural disasters increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise acts of war or terrorism disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control have interrupted product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor transportation energy pension and healthcare therefore our business results depend in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost saving projects and sourcing decisions while maintaining and improving margins and market share failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows 

our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits  

we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products achieving our business results depends in part on successfully developing introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate 

customer and consumer acceptance and trends to obtain maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also successfully respond to technological advances made by and intellectual property rights granted to competitors failure to continually innovate improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels 

the consumer products industry is highly competitive across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends including pricing promotional incentives product delivery windows and trade terms in addition evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics which for example may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models particularly ecommerce and mobile commerce applications could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows 

a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we sell most of our products via retail customers which include mass merchandisers ecommerce grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores distributors wholesalers baby stores specialty beauty stores including airport dutyfree stores highfrequency stores pharmacies electronics stores and professional channels our success depends on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers private label brands and generic nonbranded products or for other reasons significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption 

4 the procter  gamble company 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the companys reputation and the reputation of our brands form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies including consumers customers and suppliers the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall productrelated litigation defects or impurities in our products product misuse changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products additionally negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about safety quality ingredients efficacy environmental impacts or similar matters sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer our company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility strong communities diversity and inclusion gender equality and environmental sustainability if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity the companys reputation and results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our thirdparty relationships and the agreements under which our thirdparty partners operate our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted further failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the company and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and financial results additionally while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our financial legal reputational and operational risk 

a significant information security or operational technology incident including a cybersecurity breach or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems networks hardware processes andor associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information and operational technology itot systems networks and services including internet and intranet sites data hosting and processing facilities and technologies physical security systems and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms many of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business the various uses of these itot systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

• ordering and managing materials from suppliers 

• converting materials to finished products 

• shipping products to customers 

• marketing and selling products to consumers 

• collecting transferring storing andor processing customer consumer employee vendor investor and other stakeholder information and personal data including such data from persons covered by an expanding landscape of privacy and data regulations such as citizens of the european union who are covered by the general data protection regulation “gdpr” or residents of california covered by the california consumer privacy act ccpa 

• summarizing and reporting results of operations including financial reporting 

• managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms 

• hosting processing and sharing as appropriate confidential and proprietary research business plans and financial information 

• collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications 

• complying with regulatory legal and tax requirements 

• providing data security and 

• handling other processes necessary to manage our business 

numerous and evolving information security threats including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats pose a risk to the security of our services systems networks and supply chain as well as to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations in addition because the techniques tools and tactics used in cyberattacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack 

the procter  gamble company 5 

our itot databases and systems and our thirdparty providers’ databases and systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing social engineering hacking and other cyberattacks such attacks may originate from outside parties hackers criminal organizations or other threat actors including nation states in addition insider actorsmalicious or otherwisecould cause technical disruptions andor confidential data leakage we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our thirdparty providers will prevent material breaches operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our thirdparty providers’ itot databases or systems 

if the itot systems networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations or if we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations or inadvertent disclosure of lack of integrity of or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling security incidents or employee error or malfeasance and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive operational financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action periodically we also upgrade our itot systems or adopt new technologies if such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures it could affect our ability to order materials make and ship orders and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues the costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results 

changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results for example the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union brexit has created uncertainty regarding among other things the uks future legal and economic framework and how the uk will interact with other countries including with respect to the free movement of goods services capital and people in addition results of elections referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies laws and regulations may change including with respect to sanctions taxes tariffs import and export controls and the general movement of goods services capital and people between countries and other matters the potential implications of such uncertainty which include among others exchange rate fluctuations new or increased tariffs trade barriers and 

market contraction could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

we must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property product liability product composition or formulation packaging content or endoflife responsibility marketing antitrust data protection environmental including increasing focus on the climate water and waste impacts of consumer packaged goods companies operations and products employment antibribery anticorruption tax accounting and financial reporting or other matters rapidly changing laws regulations policies and related interpretations as well as increased enforcement actions create challenges for the company including our compliance and ethics programs may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws regulations policies and related interpretations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows furthermore if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

the company is subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the various tax laws can and do occur for example the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “us tax act” the changes included in the us tax act are broad and complex the ongoing impacts of the us tax act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in the reports we file with the securities and exchange commission possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations any regulatory guidance or legislative action to address questions that arise or any updates or changes to estimates the company has used to calculate the impacts 

additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are subject to potential evolution an outgrowth of the original base erosion and profit shifting “beps project is a project undertaken by the more than 130 member countries of the expanded oecd inclusive framework focused on addressing the challenges of the digitalization of the economy the breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to 

6 the procter  gamble company 

impact all multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights as this and other tax laws and related regulations change or evolve our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted given the unpredictability of these possible changes it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative but such changes could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

furthermore we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities while we believe our tax positions will be sustained the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 beauty brands transaction with coty may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we must successfully manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against our business objectives specifically our financial results have been and in the future could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures our results of operations and cash flows have been and in the future could also be impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities if 1 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 2 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges which could also result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change including attracting and retaining key talent as part of our overall succession planning 

our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings while continuing to invest in business growth could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows additionally successfully executing organizational change management transitions at leadership levels of the company and motivation and retention of key employees is critical to our business success factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation competition from other employers and availability of qualified individuals our success depends on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership 

and direction for our business this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans 

we must successfully manage the demand supply and operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak including epidemics pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns 

our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak epidemic pandemic or similar widespread public health concern such as travel restrictions or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to selfquarantine as a result of the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic these impacts include but are not limited to 

• significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products which may be caused by among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products or stockpiling or similar pantryloading activity if prolonged such impacts can further increase the difficulty of business or operations planning and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

• inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by constrained workforce capacity or the loss or disruption of other essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components transportation or other manufacturing and distribution capability 

• failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners to meet their obligations to the company or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations or 

• significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines importexport restrictions price controls or governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products which 

the procter  gamble company 7 

could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the company their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as thirdparty actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects

global economic conditions our products are sold in numerous countries across north america europe latin america asia and africa with more than half our sales generated outside the united states as such we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors us and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the covid19 pandemic resulting in both market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement as well as market size increases in certain countries due to pantry loading and increased consumption of household cleaning and personal health and hygiene products by consumers other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic and any causes of market size contraction such as 

reduced gdp in commoditydependent economies greater political unrest or instability in the middle east central  eastern europe certain latin american markets the hong kong market in greater china and the korean peninsula and economic uncertainty related to the united kingdoms exit from the european union could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin in either case reducing our net earnings and cash flows 

changes in costs our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices transportation costs and our own productivity efforts we have significant exposures to certain commodities in particular certain oilderived materials like resins and paperbased materials like pulp and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs disruptions in our manufacturing supply and distribution operations due to the covid19 pandemic may also impact our costs if we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements it may adversely impact our gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products we strive to implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plans including outsourcing projects supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization as discussed later in the mda in 2012 we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement projects in fiscal 2017 we communicated specific elements of an additional multiyear cost reduction program which is resulting in targeted enrollment reductions and other savings if we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes there could be a negative impact on our gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows 

foreign exchange we have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the us dollar as their functional currency transaction exposures relate to 1 the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2 the revaluation of transactionrelated working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in four of the past five years including fiscal 2020 the us dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations like argentina brazil greater china turkey and the united kingdom have had and could continue to have a significant impact on our sales costs and net earnings increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products which would affect our sales gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows 

the procter  gamble company 17 

government policies our net earnings could be affected by changes in us or foreign government tax policies for example the us tax act and the current work being led by the oecd for the g20 focused on addressing the challenges of the digitalization of the economy the breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jurisdictional taxation rights further our sales net earnings and cash flows may be impacted by us and foreign government policies to manage the covid19 pandemic such as movement restrictions or site closures additionally we attempt to carefully manage our debt currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange import authorization and pricing controls such as nigeria algeria egypt argentina and turkey further our sales net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in north america and elsewhere including increases of import tariffs both currently effective and future potential changes changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flows 

covid19 pandemic disclosures 

the company’s priorities during the covid19 pandemic are protecting the health and safety of our employees maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health hygiene and cleaning needs and using our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges because the company sells products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers the covid19 pandemic has not had a material net impact to our consolidated sales net earnings and cash flows in the current year however the pandemic has had offsetting impacts during the period for example during the second half of fiscal 2020 we experienced a significant increase in demand and consumption of certain of our product categories health hygiene and home cleaning products primarily in north america caused in part by changing consumer habits and pantry stocking due to the covid19 pandemic contributing to increases in sales net earnings and cash flows at the same time we experienced a decrease in sales due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movements in certain regions including europe imea asia pacific and latin america in certain channels including travel retail professional and electronics stores and in certain of our beauty and grooming products while we experienced a decrease in sales in greater china during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 demand recovered in the fourth quarter as restrictions on consumer movement were relaxed in the future the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment demand in certain of our enterprise markets including certain countries in latin america asia pacific and imea may be particularly susceptible to recession it could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products due to government actions impacting our ability to produce and ship products or impacting 

consumers’ movements and access to our products we believe that over the long term there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate particularly our products that deliver essential health hygiene and cleaning benefits however the timing and extent of demand recovery in markets such as greater china and japan the resumption of international travel the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking in markets including north america and europe and product demand volatility caused by future economic trends are unclear accordingly there may be heightened volatility in sales net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic our retail customers are also being impacted by the pandemic their success in addressing the issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to and as a result sales of our products 

our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain the company has endeavored to follow actions recommended by governments and health authorities to protect our employees worldwide with particular measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities we have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of the majority our products we were able to broadly maintain our operations in the current fiscal year but we have experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain enterprise markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements as well as increased transportation and manufacturing costs we intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement our employee safety measures to ensure that we are able to continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the pandemic however uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain for example a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials that could impact our operations 

because the pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our operations or demand for our products and resulting sales and net earnings it has also not negatively impacted the company’s liquidity position we continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our shortterm liquidity needs and we expect to maintain access to the capital markets enabled by our strong short and longterm credit ratings we have also not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the covid19 pandemic

the key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales gross margin selling general and administrative costs sga other nonoperating items and income taxes the primary factors driving yearoveryear changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete product initiatives competitive activities the level of initiatives pricing and other activities by competitors marketing spending retail executions both instore and online and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as our pricing actions which can also impact volume changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the us 

most of our cost of products sold and sga are to some extent variable in nature accordingly our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute yearoveryear changes in total costs the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs energy and other commodities pricing impacts geographic mix for example gross margins in north america are generally higher than the company average for similar products product mix for example the beauty segment has higher gross margins than the company average foreign exchange rate fluctuations in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments for example product or package improvements and to a lesser extent scale impacts for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature the primary components of sga are marketingrelated costs and nonmanufacturing overhead costs marketingrelated costs are primarily variable in nature although we may achieve some level of scale benefit 

over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies while overhead costs are variable to some extent we generally experience more scalerelated impacts 

for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth

on a regional basis volume increased high single digits in north america and increased low single digits in greater china europe asia pacific and latin america driven by innovation market growth and increased demand particularly in household cleaning and personal health and hygiene products in the second half of the fiscal year driven in part by increased consumption and pantry loading due to the covid19 pandemic volume decreased low single digits in imea as growth in the first half of the year was more than offset by market contraction in the second half of the fiscal year driven by economic slowdown resulting from the covid19 pandemic unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2 increased pricing had a positive 1 impact on net sales mix had a positive 1 impact on net sales driven by the disproportionate organic growth of the personal health care and home care categories and the north america region all of which have higher than company average selling prices organic sales grew 6 on a 4 increase in organic volume 



operating costs 



gross margin increased 170 basis points to 503 of net sales in fiscal 2020 gross margin benefited from 

• 150 basis points from total manufacturing cost savings 130 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments 

• 90 basis points from lower commodity costs and 

• 60 basis points of positive pricing impacts 

these were offset by a 70 basispoint decline from unfavorable product mix due to the disproportionate organic 

the procter  gamble company 19 

growth of the fabric  home care segment which has lower than company average gross margin and mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and larger sizes in certain categories a 20 basispoint negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange and 20 basis points of other impacts 

total sga increased 5 to 200 billion primarily due to increases in marketing spending and to a lesser extent increases in other net operating expenses and overhead costs sga as a percentage of net sales was unchanged at 282 an increase in marketing spending and other net operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was offset by a decrease in overhead costs as a percentage of net sales 

• marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points due to investments in media and other marketing spending partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation production costs and advertising spending 

• overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings partially offset by inflation and other cost increases 

• other net operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased approximately 30 basis points primarily due to the base period gain on sale of real estate 

operating margin increased 1400 basis points to 221 for fiscal 2020 1230 basis points of this increase is due to the shave care impairment charge in the base period the remaining increase is due to the increase in gross margin as discussed above 

nonoperating items 

• interest expense was 465 million in fiscal 2020 a decrease of 44 million versus the prior year due primarily to a reduction in us interest rates partially offset by an increase in debt 

• interest income was 155 million in fiscal 2020 a reduction of 65 million versus the prior year due to a reduction in average cash and investment securities balances and a reduction in us interest rates 

• other nonoperating income which consists primarily of divestiture gains and other nonoperating items decreased 433 million to 438 million primarily due to the base period gains from brand divestitures including a 355 million beforetax gain from the dissolution of the pgt healthcare partnership 

income taxes 

income taxes increased 628 million to 27 billion due to increased earnings partially offset by a decline in the effective tax rate the effective tax rate decreased 1750 basis points to 172 in 2020 due to 

• a 1750 basispoint reduction due to the prior year impact of the shave care impairment charge as there was no tax benefit related to the goodwill portion of the charge and 

• a 135 basispoint current year reduction from a tax benefit arising from transactions to simplify our legal entity structure 

these reductions were partially offset by 

• a 60 basispoint increase from unfavorable impacts from geographic mix of current year earnings caused primarily by disproportionately higher sales and earnings in the us 

• a 40 basispoint increase related to the prior year tax impact of the gain on the dissolution of the pgt healthcare partnership 

• a 30 basispoint increase from current year unfavorable discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions 15 basispoint increase in the current year rate versus a 15 basispoint decrease in the prior year rate and 

• a 5 basispoint increase from lower excess tax benefits of sharebased compensation 155 basispoint reduction in the current year versus 160 basispoint reduction in the prior year 

net earnings 

operating income increased 186 or 102 billion to 157 billion 83 billion of the increase was due to the base period charge for the shave care impairment the remaining 19 billion increase was due to the net sales increase and the increase in gross margin partially offset by the increase in sga all of which are discussed above 

earnings before income taxes increased 161 or 98 billion to 158 billion as the increase in operating income discussed above was partially offset by the base period gains from the dissolution of the pgt healthcare partnership and other minor brand divestitures net earnings increased 230 or 91 billion to 131 billion due to the increase in operating income and the reduction in effective income taxes rates discussed above foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately 390 million in fiscal 2020 due to weakening of certain currencies against the us dollar including those in argentina brazil china turkey and the united kingdom this impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to us dollars 

net earnings attributable to procter  gamble increased 91 billion or 234 to 130 billion 

diluted net eps increased 353 or 247 to 496 due primarily to the increase in net earnings 

core eps increased 13 to 512 core eps represents diluted net eps from continuing operations excluding the base year charge for the shave care impairment the base year gain on the dissolution of the pgt healthcare partnership and incremental restructuring charges in both years related to our productivity and cost savings plans the increase was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and the increase in operating margin discussed previously

restructuring program to deliver productivity and cost savings 

in fiscal 2012 the company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain research and development marketing 

and overheads the plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work processes to both fund the companys growth strategy and increase the companys operating margin in fiscal 2017 the company communicated specific elements of an additional multiyear productivity and cost savings program 

the current productivity and cost savings plan is further reducing costs in the areas of supply chain certain marketing activities and overhead expenses as part of this plan the company incurred approximately 15 billion in total before tax restructuring costs across 2019 and 2020 in fiscal 2021 and onwards the company expects to incur restructuring costs within the range of our historical ongoing level of 250 to 500 million annually savings generated from the companys restructuring program are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activities the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment however we estimate that through 2020 the underlying restructuring costs incurred since 2012 approximately 82 billion along with other nonmanufacturing enrollment reductions since 2012 have delivered approximately 37 billion in annual beforetax gross savings 

restructuring accruals of 472 million as of june 30 2020 are classified as current liabilities approximately 52 of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2020 either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuringtype activities the resulting charges are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting 

in addition to our restructuring programs we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins 

refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the operating costs section of the mda for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts 

cash flow financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses brands and geographies as necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

24 the procter  gamble company 

operating cash flow 

operating cash flow was 174 billion in 2020 a 14 increase from the prior year net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation and deferred income taxes generated approximately 161 billion of operating cash flow working capital and other impacts generated 13 billion of operating cash flow as summarized below 

• a decrease in accounts receivable generated 634 million of cash primarily due to the timing of the end of the fiscal year which fell on a tuesday versus sunday in the prior year end resulting in additional collection days in the current year and lower relative sales at the end of the period in certain markets driven by covid19 the number of days sales outstanding decreased approximately 5 days versus prior year 

• higher inventory used 637 million of cash mainly due to inventory increases to support initiatives business growth across all segments and to replenish stocks in certain categories depleted by the covid19 pandemic related demand increases inventory days on hand increased approximately 4 days primarily due to initiative support and inventory replenishment 

• accounts payable accrued and other liabilities increased generating 19 billion of cash approximately 700 million of this was driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers see extended payment terms and supply chain financing below the remaining amount was driven by higher payables from increased manufacturing activity due to the pandemic related demand increases an increase in marketing spending in the fourth quarter versus the prior year and increases in taxes payable related to the merck integration days payable outstanding increased approximately 4 days to 81 days as of june 30 2020 due to the above 

• other net operating assets and liabilities declined using 710 million of cash primarily driven by the payment of the current year portion of taxes due related to the us tax act repatriation charge 215 million and pension related accruals and contributions 

adjusted free cash flow we view adjusted free cash flow as an important nongaap measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investments it is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the us tax act and tax payments related to the merck acquisition adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their atrisk compensation 

adjusted free cash flow was 149 billion in 2020 an increase of 23 versus the prior year the increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above adjusted free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings was 114 in 2020 

extended payment terms and supply chain financing beginning in fiscal 2014 in response to evolving market practices the company began a program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers at about the same time the company initiated a supply chain finance program scf with several global financial institutions scf banks under the scf qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from the company to an scf bank these participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the respective scf bank while the company is not party to those agreements the scf banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize the company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs this generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own the company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the scf and reaches an agreement with an scf bank the supplier elects which individual company invoices they sell to the scf bank however all the company’s payments to participating suppliers are paid to the scf bank on the invoice due date regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the scf bank the scf bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold by the supplier to the scf bank 

the terms of the company’s payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the scf our payment terms with our suppliers for similar materials within individual markets are consistent between suppliers that elect to participate in the scf and those that do not participate accordingly our average days outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included in the scf in addition the scf is available to both material suppliers where the underlying costs are largely included in cost of goods sold and to service suppliers where the underlying costs are largely included in sga as of june 30 2020 approximately 3 of our global suppliers have elected to participate in the scf payments to those suppliers during 2020 total approximately 13 billion which equals approximately 24 of our total cost of goods sold and sga for the period for participating suppliers we believe substantially all of their receivables with the company are sold to the scf banks accordingly we would expect that at each balance sheet date a similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be payable to scf banks all outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the scf are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows as of both june 30 2020 and 2019 the amount due to suppliers participating in the scf and included in accounts payable were approximately 4 billion 

although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could increase at 

the procter  gamble company 25 

a slower rate in fiscal 2021 future changes in our suppliers’ financing policies or economic developments such as changes in interest rates general market liquidity or the company’s creditworthiness relative to participating suppliers could impact suppliers’ participation in the scf andor our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers however any such impacts are difficult to predict 

investing cash flow 

net investing activities generated 30 billion in cash in 2020 mainly due to proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities partially offset by capital spending net investing activities consumed 35 billion in cash in 2019 mainly due to capital spending and business acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments

investment securities investments generated net cash of 62 billion in 2020 and 35 billion in 2019 primarily from sales and maturities of investment securities 

financing cash flow 

net financing activities consumed 84 billion of cash in 2020 mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases partially offset by a net increase in debt and the impact of stock options net financing activities consumed 100 billion in cash in 2019 mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases partially offset by the impact of stock options 

dividend payments our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments dividends per common share increased 5 to 30284 per share in 2020 total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were 78 billion in 2020 and 75 billion in 2019 in april 2020 the board of directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from 07459 to 07907 per share on common stock and series a and b esop convertible class a preferred stock this represents a 6 increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 64th consecutive year that our dividend has increased we have paid a dividend for 130 consecutive years every year since our incorporation in 1890 

longterm and shortterm debt we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for 

ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital total debt was 347 billion as of june 30 2020 and 301 billion as of june 30 2019 the increase is primarily due to the issuance of bonds generating 50 billion of cash 

treasury purchases total share repurchases were 74 billion in 2020 and 50 billion in 2019 

liquidity 

at june 30 2020 our current liabilities exceeded current assets by 50 billion largely due to shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs as of june 30 2020 the company did not have material net cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries nor related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds under current law we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future 

we utilize short and longterm debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchases we have strong short and longterm debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets in addition we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that if needed should provide sufficient funding to meet shortterm financing requirements 

on june 30 2020 our shortterm credit ratings were p1 moodys and a1 standard  poors while our longterm credit ratings were aa3 moodys and aa standard  poors all with a stable outlook 

we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an 80 billion facility split between a 32 billion fiveyear facility and a 48 billion 364day facility which expire in november 2024 and november 2020 respectively both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn these credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers nor do they have material adverse events clauses except at the time of signing in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities for additional details on debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements

the following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of june 30 2020 



1 represents the us federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the us tax act does not include any provisions made for foreign withholding taxes on expected repatriations as the timing of those payments is uncertain 

2 as of june 30 2020 the companys consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of 643 million including 158 million of interest and penalties due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of june 30 2020 cannot be made 

3 represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements these future pension payments assume the company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements considering the current economic environment in which the company operates the company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements the projected payments beyond fiscal year 2023 are not currently determinable 

4 primarily reflects future contractual payments under various takeorpay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business commitments made under takeorpay obligations represent minimum commitments under takeorpay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected usage this includes service contracts for information technology human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced while the amounts listed represent contractual obligations we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity in such cases we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties resulting in a reduced payment the amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not takeorpay arrangements such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position 



significant accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include revenue recognition income taxes certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company 

the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a 

single point in time when ownership risks and rewards transfer which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer trade promotions consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances instore merchandising funds advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons are offered through various programs to customers and consumers sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation based on contractual terms sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates the actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates these differences which have historically not been significant are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period the company adopted asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” on july 1 2018 adoption of this standard resulted in a change 

the procter  gamble company 27 

in the timing of recognition of certain trade promotional spending 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards and our ability to uphold certain tax positions 

realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods which involves business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment 

a core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities however because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various crossborder transactions we have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty we estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70 of our global earnings we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the companys income taxes 

employee benefits 

we sponsor various postemployment benefits throughout the world these include pension plans both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and other postemployment benefit opeb plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations as permitted by us gaap the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary opeb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for 2020 the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and opeb assets was 66 and 84 respectively a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and opeb assets would impact annual aftertax benefitexpense by approximately 130 million 

since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses discount rates used for our us defined benefit pension and opeb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan for our international plans the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 15 represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 220 million the average discount rate on the opeb plan of 31 reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the us which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits a 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual aftertax opeb expense by approximately 50 million see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for

goodwill and intangible assets 

significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations we typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets the valuations used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions overall category growth rates competitive activities cost containment and margin progression company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows 

indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months ended december 31 assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions for example future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in addition changes to or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses 

we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets the test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a twostep process in the first step step one we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a second step step two to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill the second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting units tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination the difference between the step one fair value and the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities in step two is the 

implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if this implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying value that difference represents an impairment 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands other acquired intangible assets eg certain brands all customer relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives an impairment assessment for determinablelived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 

most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that at a minimum exceed two times their underlying carrying values certain of our goodwill reporting units in particular shave care and appliances are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high the appliances whollyacquired reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value 

during fiscal 2019 a noncash before and aftertax impairment charge of 68 billion was recognized to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill for the shave care reporting unit and a noncash beforetax impairment charge of 16 billion 12 billion aftertax was recognized to reduce the carrying amount of the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset to its fair value the underlying reductions in fair values were due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the us dollar a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits primarily in the developed markets and an increased competitive market environment in the us and certain other markets as a result of the fiscal 2019 impairment determined by the step two testing the shave care fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 20 as of june 30 2019 because the impairment testing for intangible assets is a onestep process the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value at that date during our annual impairment testing during the quarter ended december 31 2019 we reduced the discount rate used in the valuation based on developments in the macroeconomic environment as a result of this change and updates to other underlying cash flow projections the shave care fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 20 and the 

the procter  gamble company 29 

gillette indefinitelived intangible asset fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 5 

the most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates including residual growth rates and discount rate the residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorterterm business planning period the residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected longterm category market growth rates the residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates the competitive environment inflation relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share as a result the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth grooming habit changes devaluation of currencies against the us dollar or an increased competitive environment the discount rate which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant is based upon industry required rates of return including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors such as further devaluation of currencies against the us dollar spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the us 

while management can and has implemented strategies to address these events changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the shave care reporting units goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles as of june 30 2020 the carrying values of the shave care goodwill and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset were 125 billion and 141 billion respectively 

the covid19 pandemic that occurred during the second half of fiscal 2020 resulted in a reduction in shave incidents by consumers and a weakening of certain currencies relative to the us dollar which led to a reduction in net sales for gillettebranded products this resulted in a triggering event for the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset which caused us to perform an additional impairment assessment for that asset as of june 30 2020 that assessment indicated that the fair value of the gillette trade name approximated its carrying value accordingly no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended june 30 2020 

the duration and severity of the pandemic could result in additional future impairment charges for the shave care reporting unit goodwill and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset our june 30 2020 impairment assessment of the gillette intangible asset assumes the pandemic’s 

impact on net sales will begin to abate during the first half of fiscal 2021 and be largely eliminated by the second half of the fiscal year there is an extreme level of uncertainty relating to how the pandemic will evolve and how governments and consumers will react accordingly there is a significant amount of uncertainty related to this key assumption a more prolonged pandemic could impact the results of operations due to changes to assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by more prolonged reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products which may be caused by among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other travel restrictions financial hardship changes in the use and frequency of grooming products or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products in addition relative global and countryregional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the us dollar finally the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital 

the table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values the table below provides in isolation the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase to discount rate or a 25 basis point decrease to our shorterterm and residual growth rates either of which in isolation would result in an additional impairment of the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

as a multinational company with diverse product offerings we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices we evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting we leverage the companys diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments to the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations as discussed below we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities these financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument types and other hedging practices see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments 

derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk modeling the tests for interest rate currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the riskmanager™ valueatrisk model using a oneyear horizon and a 95 confidence level the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposures move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics™ dataset as of june 30 2020 in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetrics™ a reasonable proxy is included 

our market risk exposures relative to interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as discussed below have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period in addition we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term 

interest rate exposure on financial instruments interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the companys foreign net investments 

based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june 30 2020 including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates we believe a nearterm change in interest rates at a 95 confidence level based on historical interest rate movements would not materially affect our financial statements 

currency rate exposure on financial instruments because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates corporate policy 

prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months 

based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june 30 2020 we believe at a 95 confidence level based on historical currency rate movements the impact on such instruments of a nearterm change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements 

commodity price exposure on financial instruments we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors we may use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 

as of and during the years ended june 30 2020 and june 30 2019 we did not have any commodity hedging activity

adjusted free cash flow productivity adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings we view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand pg’s ability to generate cash adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes this measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for atrisk compensation the companys longterm target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent 

the following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity  millions 





core eps core eps is a measure of the companys diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated management views this nongaap measure as a useful supplemental measure of company performance over time core eps is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for atrisk compensation the table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to core eps including the following reconciling items 

• incremental restructuring the company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately 250  500 million before tax in 2012 the company began a 10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that included incremental restructuring activities in 2017 we communicated details of an additional multiyear productivity and cost savings plan this results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings the adjustment to core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs 

• gain on dissolution of the pgt healthcare partnership the company dissolved our pgt healthcare partnership a venture between the company and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd teva in the otc consumer healthcare business during the year ended june 30 2019 the transaction was accounted for as a sale of the teva portion of the pgt business and the company recognized an aftertax gain on the dissolution of 353 million 

• shave care impairment as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and in the significant accounting policies and estimates section of the mda in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 the company recognized a noncash aftertax charge of 80 billion 83 billion before tax to adjust the carrying values of the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset this was comprised of a before and aftertax impairment charge of 68 billion related to goodwill and an aftertax impairment charge of 12 billion 16 billion before tax to reduce the carrying value of the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset 

• antidilutive impacts as discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements the shave care impairment charges caused preferred shares that are normally dilutive and hence normally assumed converted for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share to be antidilutive accordingly for us gaap the preferred shares were not assumed to be converted into common shares for diluted earnings per share and the related dividends paid to the preferred

1 diluted net earnings per share are calculated on net earnings attributable to procter  gamble 





1 the reduction in net earnings from the 2019 charge for the shave care impairment caused the preferred shares outstanding to be antidilutive accordingly for us gaap the preferred shares were not assumed to be converted into common shares for diluted earnings per share and the related dividends paid to the preferred shareholders were deducted from net income to calculate earnings available to common shareholders excluding the impairment charge results in higher nongaap earnings which causes the preferred shares to be dilutive the adjustments in this row are made to reflect the dilutive preferred share impact resulting from the shave care impairment adjustment

trademarks and patents  we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products the trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products all major trademarks in each business are registered in part our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks patents and licenses 

competitive condition  the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies including wellknown global competitors in many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers privatelabel brands we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate often holding a leadership or significant market share position we support our products with advertising promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with our sales force we believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products product quality performance value and packaging are also important differentiating factors

 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k quarterly and annual reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with the mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets including foreign currency fluctuations currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility 

we are a global company with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world we hold assets incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar and our operations outside the us generate more than fifty percent of our net revenue fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies may 

 

reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows we receive from nonus markets increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those markets negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition moreover discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could adversely affect our results see also the results of operations and cash flow financial condition and liquidity sections of the mda and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

we also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange import authorization pricing or other controls or restrictions such as nigeria algeria egypt and turkey our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas or if new or increased tariffs quotas exchange or price controls trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business 

additionally our business operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions including political instability or upheaval broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments particularly in emerging markets 

uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship which could adversely impact our business 

our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local regional or global economic disruptions such as a slowdown in the general economy reduced market growth rates tighter credit markets for our suppliers vendors or customers a significant shift in government policies the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions including potential negative consumer sentiment toward nonlocal products or sources or the inability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers vendors and suppliers additionally economic conditions may cause our suppliers distributors contractors or other thirdparty partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles in addition if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow it could affect the company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments 

the procter  gamble company 3 

disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit 

a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital 

disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results 

our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements including for issues such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites discontinuity in our internal information and data systems inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials significant changes in trade policy natural disasters increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor transportation energy pension and healthcare therefore our business results are dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost saving projects and sourcing decisions while maintaining and improving margins and market share failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results 

our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits  

we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products achieving our business results depends in part on successfully developing introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends to obtain maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also successfully respond to technological advances made by and intellectual property rights granted to competitors failure to continually innovate improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results 

 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels 

the consumer products industry is highly competitive across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends including pricing promotional incentives product delivery windows and trade terms in addition evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics which for example may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models particularly ecommerce and mobile commerce applications could negatively impact our results 

a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we sell most of our products via retail customers which include mass merchandisers ecommerce grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores distributors wholesalers baby stores specialty beauty stores highfrequency stores and pharmacies our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level or shelf space of our products as a result of increased offerings of private label brands and generic nonbranded products or for other reasons significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the companys reputation and the reputation of our brands form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies including consumers customers and suppliers the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers our results could also be negatively impacted if 

4 the procter  gamble company 

one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall productrelated litigation defects or impurities in our products product misuse changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products additionally negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about safety quality ingredients efficacy environmental impacts or similar matters sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer our company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility strong communities diversity and inclusion gender equality and environmental sustainability if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity the companys reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our thirdparty relationships and the agreements under which our thirdparty partners operate our financial results could suffer additionally while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our financial legal reputational and operational risk 

an information security or operational technology incident including a cybersecurity breach or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems networks hardware processes andor associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation 

as part of the company’s regular review of potential risks we maintain an information and operational technology “itot” risk management program that is primarily supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal crossfunctional stakeholders as part of this program analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats as well as the company’s plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management the audit committee and the board of directors despite our policies procedures and programs including this itot risk management program we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed 

 

we rely extensively on itot systems networks and services including internet and intranet sites data hosting and processing facilities and technologies physical security systems and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms many of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business the various uses of these itot systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

 numerous and evolving information security threats including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats pose a risk to the security of our services systems networks and supply chain as well as to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations as cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally the company is continually increasing its attention to these threats we assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and systems increasing specialized information security skills deploying employee security training and updating security policies for the company and its thirdparty providers however because the techniques tools and tactics used in cyberattacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack 

our itot databases and systems and our thirdparty providers’ databases and systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing social engineering hacking and other cyberattacks such attacks may originate from 

the procter  gamble company 5 

outside parties hackers criminal organizations or other threat actors including nation states in addition insider actorsmalicious or otherwisecould cause technical disruptions andor confidential data leakage to date we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks however we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our thirdparty providers will prevent material breaches operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our thirdparty providers’ itot databases or systems 

periodically we also need to upgrade our itot systems or adopt new technologies if such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures it could affect our ability to order materials make and ship orders and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues further if the itot systems networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations or if we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations or inadvertent disclosure of lack of integrity of or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling security incidents or employee error or malfeasance and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive operational financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action the costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results 

changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results 

changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results for example the united kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the european union brexit has created uncertainty regarding among other things the uks future legal and economic framework and how the uk will interact with other countries including with respect to the free movement of goods services capital and people in addition results of elections referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies laws and regulations may change including with respect to sanctions taxes the movement of goods services capital and people between countries and other matters the potential implications of such uncertainty which include among others exchange rate fluctuations tariffs trade barriers and market contraction could adversely affect the company’s business and financial results 

we must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property product 

 

liability product composition or formulation packaging content or disposability marketing antitrust data protection environmental including climate water waste employment antibribery anticorruption tax accounting and financial reporting or other matters rapidly changing laws regulations policies and related interpretations as well as increased enforcement actions create challenges for the company including our compliance and ethics programs may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance which could adversely impact our financial results if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws regulations policies and related interpretations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position furthermore if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

the company is subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the various tax laws can and do occur for example the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “us tax act” the changes included in the us tax act are broad and complex the ongoing impacts of the us tax act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations any regulatory guidance or legislative action to address questions that arise or any updates or changes to estimates the company has used to calculate the impacts 

additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are subject to potential evolution an outgrowth of the original base erosion and profit shifting “beps project is a new project undertaken by the 129 member countries of the expanded oecd inclusive framework focused on addressing the challenges of the digitalization of the economy the breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights as this and other tax laws and related regulations change or evolve our financial results could be materially impacted given the unpredictability of these possible changes it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 

furthermore we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities while we believe our tax positions will be sustained the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 

6 the procter  gamble company 

beauty brands transaction with coty may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results 

we must successfully manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against our business objectives specifically our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures our financial results could also be impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities such as the integration of merck kgaas consumer health business acquired in fiscal 2019 if 1 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 2 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change 

our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings while continuing to invest in business growth could adversely impact our financial results additionally successfully executing organizational change including the move to a new organizational structure in fiscal 2020 management transitions at leadership levels of the company and motivation and retention of key employees is critical to our business success factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation competition from other employers and availability of qualified personnel our success is dependent on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans

economic conditions and uncertainties 

we discuss expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in annual and quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all such statements except for historical and present factual information are forwardlooking statements and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outofdate or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations for more information on risk factors that could impact our results please refer to “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

global economic conditions our products are sold in numerous countries across north america europe latin america asia and africa with more than half our sales generated outside the united states as such we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors us and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic and any causes of market size contraction such as reduced gdp in commoditydependent economies greater political unrest in the middle east central  eastern europe and the korean peninsula economic uncertainty related to the execution of the united kingdoms exit from the european union political instability in certain latin american and asian markets and overall economic slowdowns could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin in either case reducing our earnings 

changes in costs our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices transportation costs and our own productivity efforts we have significant exposures to certain commodities in particular certain oilderived materials like resins and paperbased materials like pulp and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs if we are unable to manage commodity and other cost fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements it may adversely impact our gross margin operating margin and net earnings sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products we strive to implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plans including outsourcing projects supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization as discussed later in this mda in 2012 we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement projects in fiscal 2017 we communicated specific elements of an additional multiyear cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reductions and other savings if we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings 

foreign exchange we have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates translation 

 

exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the us dollar as their functional currency transaction exposures relate to 1 the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2 the revaluation of transactionrelated working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in four of the past five years including fiscal 2019 the us dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations like argentina russia turkey brazil china and the united kingdom have had and could continue to have a significant impact on our sales costs and earnings increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products which would affect our sales and profits 

government policies our net earnings could be affected by changes in us or foreign government tax policies for example the us tax act the implications and uncertainties of which are disclosed elsewhere in this report additionally we attempt to carefully manage our debt currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange import authorization and pricing controls such as nigeria algeria egypt and turkey further our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in north america and elsewhere including increases of import tariffs both currently effective and future potential changes changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales operating margin and net earnings 

results of operations 

the key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales gross margin selling general and administrative costs sga other nonoperating items and income taxes the primary factors driving yearoveryear changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete product initiatives competitive activities the level of initiatives pricing and other activities by competitors marketing spending retail executions both instore and online and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as our pricing actions which can also indirectly impact volume changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the us 

most of our cost of products sold and sga are to some extent variable in nature accordingly our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute yearoveryear changes in total costs the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs energy and other commodities pricing impacts geographic mix for example gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products product mix for example the beauty segment has higher gross margins than the company average foreign exchange rate fluctuations in situations where certain input 

16 the procter  gamble company 

costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments for example product or package improvements and to a lesser extent scale impacts for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature the primary components of sga are marketingrelated costs and nonmanufacturing overhead costs marketingrelated costs are primarily variable in nature although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies while overhead costs are variable to some extent we generally experience more scalerelated impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth 

a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2018 yearoveryear changes can be found in the mda section in the form 8k filed october 22 2018 which updated our form 10k for the year ended june 30 2018 to revise disclosures to reflect the adoption of the financial accounting standards board fasb asu 201707 and 201618 for more information on the adoption of this standard refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

nonoperating items 

 income taxes 

income taxes decreased 14 billion to 21 billion the effective tax rate increased 870 basis points to 347 in 2019 the current year shave care impairment charges caused a 1750 basispoint increase in the effective tax rate as there is no tax benefit related to the goodwill portion of the impairment excluding this impact the effective tax rate declined 880 basis points primarily due to the impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act the us tax act in december 2017 the us tax act among other things lowered the us corporate income tax rates but also imposed a onetime repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries and caused us to adjust our us deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21 these transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net charge of 602 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of 38 billion comprised of us repatriation taxes and foreign withholding taxes and an estimated net deferred tax benefit of 32 billion in addition because the company has a june 30 fiscal yearend the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in resulting in a us statutory federal rate of approximately 28 for our fiscal year ended june 30 2018 and 21 for our fiscal year ended june 30 2019 and subsequent fiscal years combined these impacts reduced the current year effective tax rate by 950 basis points consisting of 



 

the remaining 70 basis point net increase in the current year income tax rate was driven by 

 net earnings 

operating income decreased 79 billion  or 59 primarily due to the 83 billion before tax impairment charge for shave care this was partially offset by the net sales increase along with the marginal increase in gross margin and decrease in sga spending as a percentage of sales all of which are discussed above 

earnings before income taxes decreased 73 billion or 54 to 61 billion as the reduction in operating income discussed in the preceding paragraph was partially offset by the current year gain from the dissolution of the pgt healthcare partnership and the base year charges for the early extinguishment of debt each of which was discussed earlier net earnings decreased 59 billion or 60 to 40 billion  net earnings declined less than earnings before income taxes due to the above discussed reduction in income taxes foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately 900 million in 2019 due to weakening of certain currencies against the us dollar including those in argentina russia turkey brazil china and the united kingdom this impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to us dollars

corporate 



corporate includes certain operating and nonoperating activities not allocated to specific business segments these include the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level financing and investing activities certain employee benefit costs other general corporate items gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories certain asset impairment charges and certain restructuringtype activities to maintain a competitive cost structure including manufacturing and workforce optimization corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to us gaap the most significant ongoing reconciling item is income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall company effective tax rate for 2018 the tax impact also includes the impacts of the us tax act which were included in the corporate segment 

corporate net sales decreased 3 to 484 million in 2019 due to a decrease in the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level corporate net loss increased by 78 billion in 2019 primarily due to the 80 billion after tax 83 billion before tax charge for the shave care impairment as well as the impact of the allocation methodology of the lower us tax rates the us tax act was enacted in the middle of fiscal 2018 therefore the net benefit was held in corporate beginning in fiscal 2019 the lower rates are included in the reporting segments these impacts were partially offset by the following benefits each of which was discussed earlier 

 restructuring program to deliver productivity and cost savings 

in 2012 the company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain research and development marketing and overheads the plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work processes to fund the companys growth strategy in 2017 the company communicated specific elements of an additional multiyear productivity and cost savings program 

the current productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain certain marketing activities and overhead expenses as part of this plan the company incurred approximately 18 billion in total before tax restructuring costs across 2018 and 2019 with an additional 

 

amount of approximately 06 billion expected in 2020 this program is expected to result in additional enrollment reductions along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes savings generated from restructuring costs are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activities the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment however we estimate that through 2019 the underlying restructuring costs incurred since 2012 approximately 74 billion along with other nonmanufacturing enrollment reductions since 2012 have delivered approximately 36 billion in annual beforetax gross savings 

restructuring accruals of 468 million as of june 30 2019 are classified as current liabilities approximately 67 of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2019 either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuringtype activities the resulting charges are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting 

in addition to our restructuring programs we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins 

refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the operating costs section of the mda for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts 

cash flow financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses brands and geographies as necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating cash flow 

operating cash flow was 152 billion in 2019  a 3 increase from the prior year net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation deferred income taxes gain on sale of assets and goodwill and indefinitelived intangible impairment charges generated approximately 146 billion of operating cash flow working capital and other impacts generated 07 billion of operating cash flow as summarized below 



22 the procter  gamble company 

days collection the number of days sales outstanding increased approximately one day versus prior year 

 adjusted free cash flow we view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investment it is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the us tax act and it is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their atrisk compensation 

adjusted free cash flow was 121 billion in 2019  an increase of 9 versus the prior year the increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above adjusted free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the shave care impairment charges and the gain on dissolution of the pgt healthcare partnership was 105 in 2019  

investing cash flow 

net investing activities consumed 35 billion in cash in 2019  mainly due to capital spending and business acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments 

capital spending capital expenditures primarily to support capacity expansion innovation and cost efficiencies were 33 billion in 2019  a decrease of 10 versus prior year capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 70 basis points to 49 in 2019  

acquisitions acquisition activity used cash of 39 billion in 2019  primarily related to the merck otc acquisition acquisition activity used 109 million in 2018  primarily related to acquisitions in the beauty segment 

proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales proceeds from asset sales were 394 million in 2019 primarily from minor brand divestitures and the sale of real estate proceeds from asset sales contributed 269 million in cash in 2018 primarily from minor brand divestitures 

shortterm investments shortterm investments generated net cash of 35 billion in 2019 primarily from sales and 

 

maturities of availableforsale investments net cash flow from shortterm investments was not material in 2018 

financing cash flow 

net financing activities consumed 100 billion in cash in 2019  mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases partially offset by the impact of stock options 

dividend payments our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments dividends per common share increased 4 to 290 per share in 2019  total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were 75 billion in 2019 and 73 billion in 2018  in april 2019 the board of directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from 07172 to 07459 per share on common stock and series a and b esop convertible class a preferred stock this represents a 4 increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 63rd consecutive year that our dividend has increased we have paid a dividend for 129 consecutive years every year since our incorporation in 1890 

longterm and shortterm debt we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital total debt was 301 billion as of june 30 2019 and 313 billion as of june 30 2018  

treasury purchases total share repurchases were 50 billion in 2019 and 70 billion in 2018  

liquidity 

at june 30 2019  our current liabilities exceeded current assets by 75 billion  largely due to shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs as of june 30 2019  57 billion of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was related to foreign subsidiaries primarily various western european and asian countries under current law we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future as of june 30 2019  we did not have material cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds 

we utilize short and longterm debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchases we have strong short and longterm debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets in addition we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that if needed should provide sufficient credit funding to meet shortterm financing requirements 

on june 30 2019  our shortterm credit ratings were p1 moodys and a1 standard  poors while our longterm 

the procter  gamble company 23 

credit ratings were aa3 moodys and aa standard  poors all with a stable outlook 

we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an 80 billion facility split between a 32 billion fouryear facility and a 48 billion 364day facility which expire in november 2022 and november 2019 respectively both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn these credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers nor do they have material adverse events clauses except at the time 

 

of signing in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities for additional details on debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual commitments 

the following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of june 30 2019  



 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include revenue recognition income taxes certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note 

 

1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company 

the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

revenue recognition 

24 the procter  gamble company 

our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership risks and rewards transfer which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer trade promotions consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances instore merchandising funds advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons are offered through various programs to customers and consumers sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation based on contractual terms sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates the actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates these differences which have historically not been significant are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period the company adopted asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” on july 1 2018 adoption of this standard resulted in a change in the timing of recognition of certain trade promotional spending see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards and our ability to uphold certain tax positions 

realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods which involves business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment 

a core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities however because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various crossborder transactions we have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty we estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70 of our global earnings we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in 

 

accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the companys income taxes

we sponsor various postemployment benefits throughout the world these include pension plans both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and other postemployment benefit opeb plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations as permitted by us gaap the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary opeb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for 2019  the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and opeb assets was 66 and 83 respectively a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and opeb assets would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 115 million 

since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses discount rates used for our us defined benefit pension and opeb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts 

the procter  gamble company 25 

of the plan for our international plans the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 19 represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 200 million the average discount rate on the opeb plan of 37 reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the us which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits a 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual aftertax opeb expense by approximately 60 million see note 8 to the consolidated financial statement for additional details on our defined benefit pension and opeb plans 

goodwill and intangible assets 

significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations we typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets the valuations used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions overall category growth rates competitive activities cost containment and margin progression company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows 

indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months ended december 31 assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions for example future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in addition changes to or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses 

we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets the test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two step process in the first step step one we compare 

 

the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a second step step two to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill the second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting units tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination the difference between the step one fair value and the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities in step two is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill 

if this implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying value that difference represents an impairment 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands other acquired intangible assets eg certain brands all customer relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives an impairment assessment for determinablelived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 

most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that at a minimum exceed two times their underlying carrying values certain of our goodwill reporting units in particular shave care and appliances are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high the appliances whollyacquired reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value as previously disclosed the fair value of the shave care reporting unit and the related gillette indefinitelived intangible asset have been reduced during the recent year to amounts that approximated carrying value the fair value reductions were due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the us dollar a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits primarily in the developed markets and an increased competitive market environment in the us and certain other markets which collectively have resulted in reduced cash flow projections the business continued to be impacted by these factors during the quarter ended june 30 2019 which reduced previous estimates of earnings for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 because of this we reperformed our step one impairment tests for these assets as of june 30 2019 and determined that the fair values have been reduced below their respective carrying values 

therefore we conducted a step two test of goodwill for the shave care reporting unit step two requires that we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to identifiable assets and 

26 the procter  gamble company 

liabilities of the reporting unit including previously amortized or unrecognized intangible assets any residual fair value after this allocation is compared to the goodwill balance and any excess goodwill is charged to expense the step two test resulted in an implied fair value of the shave care goodwill that was below the carrying value therefore we recognized a noncash before and aftertax impairment charge of 68 billion  the resulting carrying value of the shave care goodwill is 126 billion as of june 30 2019  as a result of the methodology used in the step two testing the shave care fair value now exceeds the carrying value by approximately 20  this is primarily due to higher estimated fair values for certain fixed assets and defined lived intangibles assets both of which have been partially amortized subsequent to their initial acquisition along with fair values assigned to intangible assets not eligible for recognition in the financial statements 

the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset impairment charge was 16 billion  12 billion after tax this charge was equal to the difference between its estimated fair value as calculated in step one and its carrying value the resulting carrying value of the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset is 141 billion as of june 30 2019  which is equal to its estimated fair value as a result the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset is more susceptible to future impairment risk 

the shave care goodwill and gillette indefinitelived asset impairment charges are presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of earnings irrespective of these impairment charges the shave care business has consistently generated significant earnings and cash flow and will continue to be a strategic business for the company with attractive earnings cash flow and growth opportunities 

the most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates including residual growth rates and discount rate the residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorterterm business planning period and approximates expected long term category market growth rates the net sales and earnings growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates the competitive environment inflation relative currency exchange rates business activities that impact market share and input cost fluctuations as a result these growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth grooming habit changes an increased competitive environment increases in input costs or devaluation of currencies against the us dollar spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the us the discount rate which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant is based upon industry required rates of return including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors such as further devaluation of currencies against the us dollar while management can and has implemented strategies to address 

 

these events changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the reporting units goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

the table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values the table below provides in isolation the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase to discount rate or a 25 basis point decrease to our shorterterm and residual growth rates both of which would result in incremental impairment charges to the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

as a multinational company with diverse product offerings we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices we evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting we leverage the companys diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments to the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations as discussed below we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities these financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument types and other hedging practices see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments 

derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk modeling the tests for interest rate currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the riskmanager™ valueatrisk model using a oneyear horizon and a 95 confidence level the model incorporates 

the procter  gamble company 27 

the impact of correlation the degree to which exposures move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics™ dataset as of june 30 2019  in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetrics™ a reasonable proxy is included 

our market risk exposures relative to interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as discussed below have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period in addition we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term 

interest rate exposure on financial instruments interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the companys foreign net investments 

based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june 30 2019  including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates we believe a nearterm change in interest rates at a 95 confidence level based on historical interest rate movements would not materially affect our financial statements 

currency rate exposure on financial instruments because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months 

based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june 30 2019  we believe at a 95 confidence level based on historical currency rate movements the impact on such instruments of a nearterm change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements 

commodity price exposure on financial instruments we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors we may use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 

as of and during the years ended june 30 2019 and june 30 2018  we did not have any commodity hedging activity

financial information about segments 

as of june 30 2018  the company has five reportable segments under us gaap beauty  grooming  health care  fabric  home care and baby feminine  family care  many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate while none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal components within certain reportable segments such as appliances grooming and personal health care health are seasonal 

additional information about our reportable segments can be found in the mda and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k quarterly and annual reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with the mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

the procter  gamble company 3 

our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets including foreign currency fluctuations currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility 

we are a global company with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world we hold assets incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar and our operations outside the us generate a significant portion of our net revenue fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows we receive from nonus markets increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those markets negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition moreover discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries including potential changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could adversely affect our results see also the results of operations and cash flow financial condition and liquidity sections of the mda and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

we also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange import authorization pricing or other controls or restrictions such as nigeria algeria and egypt our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas or if new or increased tariffs quotas exchange or price controls trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business 

additionally our business operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions including political instability or upheaval broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments particularly in emerging markets 

uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship which could adversely impact our business 

our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local regional or global economic disruptions such as a slowdown in the general economy reduced market growth rates tighter credit markets for our suppliers vendors or customers a significant shift in government policies or the inability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers vendors and suppliers additionally economic conditions may cause our suppliers distributors contractors or other thirdparty partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles in addition if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow it could affect the company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments 

disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit 

a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital 

disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results 

our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements including for issues such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites discontinuity in our internal information and data systems inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials significant changes in trade policy natural disasters increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor transportation energy pension and healthcare therefore our business results are dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost saving projects and sourcing decisions while maintaining and improving margins and market share failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results 

our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits  

we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products achieving our business results depends in part on successfully developing introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends to obtain maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we 

4 the procter  gamble company 

must also successfully respond to technological advances made by and intellectual property rights granted to competitors failure to continually innovate improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels 

the consumer products industry is highly competitive across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends including pricing promotional incentives product delivery windows and trade terms in addition evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics which for example may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online and growth in hard discounter channels failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models particularly ecommerce and mobile commerce applications could negatively impact our results 

a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we sell most of our products via retail customers which include mass merchandisers ecommerce grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores distributors wholesalers baby stores specialty beauty stores highfrequency stores and pharmacies our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level or shelf space of our products as a result of increased offerings of private label brands and generic nonbranded products or for other reasons significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the companys reputation and the reputation of our brands form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies including consumers customers and suppliers the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business many of our brands have worldwide 

 

recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall productrelated litigation defects or impurities in our products product misuse changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products additionally negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about safety quality ingredients efficacy environmental impacts or similar matters sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer our company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility strong communities diversity and inclusion gender equality and environmental sustainability if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity the companys reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our thirdparty relationships and the agreements under which our thirdparty partners operate our financial results could suffer additionally while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our financial legal reputational and operational risk 

an information security or operational technology incident including a cybersecurity breach or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems networks hardware processes andor associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation 

as part of the company’s regular review of potential risks we maintain an information and operational technology “itot” risk management program that is primarily supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal crossfunctional stakeholders as part of this program analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats as well as the company’s plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management the audit 

the procter  gamble company 5 

committee and the board of directors despite our policies procedures and programs including this itot risk management program we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed 

we rely extensively on itot systems networks and services including internet and intranet sites data hosting and processing facilities and technologies physical security systems and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms many of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business the various uses of these itot systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

 numerous and evolving information security threats including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats pose a risk to the security of our services systems networks and supply chain as well as to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations as cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally the company is continually increasing its attention to these threats we assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and systems increasing specialized information security skills deploying employee security training and updating security policies for the company and its thirdparty providers however because the techniques tools and tactics used in cyber attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack 

our itot databases and systems and our thirdparty providers’ databases and systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to advanced computer viruses or other 

 

malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing social engineering hacking and other cyberattacks such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties hackers criminal organizations or other threat actors to date we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks however we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our thirdparty providers will prevent material breaches operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our thirdparty providers’ itot databases or systems 

periodically we also need to upgrade our itot systems or adopt new technologies if such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures it could affect our ability to order materials make and ship orders and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues further if the itot systems networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations or if we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations or inadvertent disclosure of lack of integrity of or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling security incidents or employee error or malfeasance and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive operational financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action the costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results 

changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results 

changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results for example the united kingdom’s decision to leave the european union has created uncertainty regarding among other things the uks future legal and economic framework and how the uk will interact with other countries including with respect to the free movement of goods services capital and people in addition results of elections referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies laws and regulations may change including with respect to sanctions taxes the movement of goods services capital and people between countries and other matters the potential implications of such uncertainty which include among others exchange rate fluctuations trade barriers and market contraction could adversely affect the company’s business and financial results 

we must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across all of the countries in which we do business including 

6 the procter  gamble company 

those laws and regulations involving intellectual property product liability marketing antitrust data protection environmental including climate water waste employment antibribery anticorruption tax accounting and financial reporting or other matters rapidly changing laws regulations and related interpretations as well as increased enforcement actions create challenges for the company including our compliance and ethics programs and may alter the environment in which we do business which could adversely impact our financial results if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws regulations and related interpretations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position furthermore if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

the company is subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the various tax laws can and do occur for example on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “us tax act” the changes included in the us tax act are broad and complex the final transition impacts of the us tax act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations of the us tax act any regulatory guidance or legislative action to address questions that arise because of the us tax act or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts including impacts from changes to current year earnings estimates 

additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements “beps recommended by the g8 g20 and organization for economic cooperation and development oecd as these and other tax laws and related regulations change our financial results could be materially impacted given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 

furthermore we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities while we believe our tax positions will be sustained the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 beauty brands transaction with coty may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial 

 

statements which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results 

we must successfully manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against our business objectives specifically our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures such as the termination of the pgt healthcare partnership between the company and teva pharmaceutical industries our financial results could also be impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities such as the planned acquisition of merck kgaas consumer health business if 1 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 2 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change 

our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings while continuing to invest in business growth could adversely impact our financial results additionally successfully executing organizational change including management transitions at leadership levels of the company and motivation and retention of key employees is critical to our business success factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation competition from other employers and availability of qualified personnel our success is dependent on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans

economic conditions and uncertainties 

we discuss expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in annual and quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all such statements except for historical and present factual information are forwardlooking statements and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outofdate or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations for more information on risks that could impact our results refer to item 1a risk factors in this form 10k 

global economic conditions current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic and any causes of market size contraction such as reduced gdp in commoditydependent economies greater political unrest in the middle east central  eastern europe and the korean peninsula economic uncertainty related to the execution of the united kingdoms exit from the european union political instability in certain latin american markets and overall economic slowdowns could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin in either case reducing our earnings 

changes in costs our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices transportation costs and our own productivity efforts we have significant exposures to certain commodities in particular certain oilderived materials like resins and paperbased materials like pulp and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs if we are unable to manage commodity and other cost fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements it may adversely impact our gross margin operating margin and net earnings sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products we strive to implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plans including outsourcing projects supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization as discussed later in this mda we initiated certain nonmanufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvement projects in 2012 in fiscal 2017 we communicated specific elements of an additional multiyear cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reductions and other savings if we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings 

foreign exchange we have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the us dollar as their functional currency transaction exposures relate to 1 the impact from input costs that are denominated in a 

 

currency other than the local reporting currency and 2 the revaluation of transactionrelated working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency over previous fiscal years the us dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations like argentina egypt russia turkey and the united kingdom have previously had and could in the future have a significant impact on our sales costs and earnings increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products which would affect our sales and profits 

government policies our net earnings could be affected by changes in us or foreign government tax policies for example the us tax act enacted in december 2017 the implications and uncertainties of which are disclosed elsewhere in this report additionally we attempt to carefully manage our debt currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange import authorization and pricing controls such as nigeria algeria and egypt further our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in north america and elsewhere including potential increases of import tariffs changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales operating margin and net earnings

results of operations 

the key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales gross margin selling general and administrative costs sga other nonoperating items and income taxes the primary factors driving yearoveryear changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete product initiatives competitive activities the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors marketing spending and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as pricing actions which can also indirectly impact volume changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the us 

most of our cost of products sold and sga are to some extent variable in nature accordingly our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute yearoveryear changes in total costs the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs energy and other commodities pricing impacts geographic mix for example gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products product mix for example the beauty segment has higher gross margins than the company average foreign exchange rate fluctuations in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the 

the procter  gamble company 17 

underlying sales the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments for example product or package improvements and to a lesser extent scale impacts for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature the primary components of sga are marketingrelated costs and nonmanufacturing overhead costs marketingrelated costs are primarily variable in nature although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies overhead costs are also variable in nature but on a relative basis less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth accordingly we generally experience more scalerelated impacts for these costs 

the company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain certain marketing activities and overhead expenses the plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work processes to fund the companys growth strategy

corporate level corporate net earningsloss from continuing operations decreased by 380 million in 2018 primarily due to 

 these costs were partially offset by lower charges related to the early extinguishment of longterm debt in 2018 versus 2017 the lower tax rate on current year earnings as a result of the us tax act and an increase in the proportion of corporate overhead spending allocated to the segments

restructuring program to deliver productivity and cost savings 

in 2012 the company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain research and development marketing and overheads the plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work processes to fund the companys growth strategy in 2017 the company communicated specific elements of an additional multiyear productivity and cost savings program 

the current productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain certain marketing activities and overhead expenses as part of this plan the company incurred approximately 11 billion in total before tax restructuring costs in fiscal 2018 with an additional amount of approximately 08 billion expected in fiscal 2019 this program is expected to result in additional enrollment reductions along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes savings generated from restructuring costs are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activities the timing of the execution and the degree of 

the procter  gamble company 25 

reinvestment however we estimate that through 2018 the underlying restructuring costs and other nonmanufacturing enrollment reductions since 2012 have delivered approximately 33 billion in annual beforetax gross savings 

restructuring accruals of 513 million as of june 30 2018 are classified as current liabilities approximately 65 of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2018 either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuringtype activities the resulting charges are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting 

in addition to our restructuring programs we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins

cash flow financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses brands and geographies as necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating cash flow 

fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 

operating cash flow was  149 billion in 2018  a 17 increase from the prior year net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization loss on extinguishment of debt sharebased compensation deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets generated 114 billion of operating cash flow working capital and other impacts generated 35 billion of operating cash flow as summarized below

operating cash flow was 128 billion in 2017  a 17 decrease from the prior year net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation deferred income taxes lossgain on sale of assets and impairment charges and the loss on early extinguishment of debt generated 130 billion of operating cash flow working capital and other impacts used 281 million of operating cash flow 

 adjusted free cash flow we view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investment it is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding tax payments related to certain divestitures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their atrisk compensation 

26 the procter  gamble company 

fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 

adjusted free cash flow was 112 billion in 2018  an increase of 14 versus the prior year the increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above adjusted free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the transitional impact of the us tax act and the loss on early extinguishment of debt was 104 in 2018  

fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 

adjusted free cash flow was 98 billion in 2017  a decrease of 19 versus the prior year the decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flows adjusted free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the loss on debt extinguishment and impacts of the sale of the beauty brands was 94 in 2017  

investing cash flow 

fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 

net investing activities consumed 35 billion in cash in 2018 mainly due to capital spending and purchases of shortterm investments partially offset by proceeds from asset sales and sales and maturities of shortterm investments 

fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 

net investing activities consumed 57 billion in cash in 2017 mainly due to capital spending and purchases of shortterm investments partially offset by proceeds from asset sales transactions related to the close of the beauty brands divestiture and sales and maturities of shortterm investments 

capital spending capital expenditures primarily to support capacity expansion innovation and cost efficiencies were 37 billion in 2018 and 34 billion in 2017  capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points to 56 in 2018  capital spending as a percentage of net sales was 52 in 2017

proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales proceeds from asset sales in 2018 contributed 269 million in cash primarily from minor brand divestitures proceeds from asset sales contributed 571 million in cash in 2017 primarily from real estate sales and other minor brand divestitures in fiscal 2017 the company invested an additional 874 million of cash received from the issuance of debt in restricted cash at the closing of the beauty brands transaction 19 billion of restricted cash including the 874 million invested in 2017 was released and returned to cash and cash equivalents and 475 million of cash was transferred to the discontinued beauty brands business

dividend payments our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments dividends per common share increased 33 to 279 per share in 2018  total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were 73 billion in 2018 and 72 billion in 2017  in april 2018 the board of directors 

 

declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from 06896 to 07172 per share on common stock and series a and b esop convertible class a preferred stock this represents a 4 increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 62nd consecutive year that our dividend has increased we have paid a dividend for 128 years every year since our incorporation in 1890 

longterm and shortterm debt we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital total debt was 313 billion as of june 30 2018 and 316 billion as of june 30 2017  

treasury purchases total share repurchases were 70 billion in 2018 and 52 billion in 2017  

liquidity 

at june 30 2018  our current liabilities exceeded current assets by 49 billion largely due to shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs as of june 30 2018  114 billion of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was held offshore by foreign subsidiaries this balance has declined versus the prior year primarily due to cash repatriations following the enactment of the us tax act under current law we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future of the june 30 2018 balance of offshore cash cash equivalents and marketable securities the majority relates to various western european countries as of june 30 2018  we did not have material cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds 

we utilize short and longterm debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchases we have strong short and longterm debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets in addition we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that if needed should provide sufficient credit funding to meet shortterm financing requirements 

on june 30 2018  our shortterm credit ratings were p1 moodys and a1 standard  poors while our longterm credit ratings were aa3 moodys and aa standard  poors all with a stable outlook 

we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an 80 billion facility split between a 32 billion fiveyear facility and a 48 billion 364day facility which expire in november 2022 and november 2018 respectively both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms 

the procter  gamble company 27 

of the credit agreement these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn these credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers nor do they have material adverse events clauses except at the time of signing in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities for additional details on debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual commitments 

the following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of june 30 2018  



 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include revenue recognition income taxes certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed 

 

as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company 

the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

revenue recognition 

sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned for us this generally means revenue is recognized when title to the product ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer trade promotions 

28 the procter  gamble company 

consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances instore merchandising funds advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons are offered through various programs to customers and consumers sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending which is recognized as incurred generally at the time of the sale amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation based on contractual terms customer performance sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates the actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates these differences which have historically not been significant are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period the company will adopt asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” on july 1 2018 adoption of this standard will result in a change in the timing of recognition of certain trade promotional spending see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards and our ability to uphold certain tax positions 

realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods which involves business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment 

a core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities however because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various crossborder transactions we have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty we estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70 of our global earnings we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have 

 

a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate for additional details on the companys income taxes see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

employee benefits 

we sponsor various postemployment benefits throughout the world these include pension plans both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and other postemployment benefit opeb plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations as permitted by us gaap the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary opeb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for 2018  the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and opeb assets was 68 and 83 respectively a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and opeb assets would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 115 million 

since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses discount rates used for our us defined benefit pension and opeb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan for our international plans the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined 

the procter  gamble company 29 

benefit pension plans of 25 represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 190 million the average discount rate on the opeb plan of 42 reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the us which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits a 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual aftertax opeb expense by approximately 65 million for additional details on our defined benefit pension and opeb plans see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets 

significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations we typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets the valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions overall category growth rates competitive activities cost containment and margin progression company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows 

indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested separately at least annually for impairment assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions for example future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in addition changes to or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses 

we test individual indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets the test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two step process in the first step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill the second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting units tangible and 

 

intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination if the resulting implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying value that difference represents an impairment 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands other acquired intangible assets eg certain brands all customer relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives an impairment assessment for determinablelived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 

most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that at a minimum exceed two times their underlying carrying values certain of our goodwill reporting units in particular shave care and appliances are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high both of these whollyacquired reporting units have fair value cushions the fair values currently exceed the underlying carrying values however the overall shave care cushion as well as the related gillette indefinitelived intangible asset cushion have both been reduced to below 10  both due in large part to an increased competitive market environment a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the us dollar that have occurred in recent years and which has contributed to reduced cash flow projections as a result this reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are more susceptible to impairment risk 

the most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset are the residual net sales and earnings growth rates and discount rate the residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the 10year time horizon the residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long term category market growth rates the residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates the competitive environment inflation relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share as a result the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth grooming habit changes devaluation of currencies against the us dollar or an increased competitive environment the discount rate which is 

30 the procter  gamble company 

consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant is based upon industry required rates of return including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors such as further devaluation of currencies against the us dollar and changes in expected rates of inflation while management can and has implemented strategies to address these events significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business units goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles as of june 30 2018  the carrying values of shave care goodwill and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset are 195 billion and 157 billion  respectively 

the table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the residual net sales growth rate and the discount rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values the table below provides in isolation the estimated fair value impacts related to a 50 basis point decrease to our residual net sales growth rate or a 50 basis point increase to our discount rate given the size of the fair value cushions changes in the assumptions of this magnitude would result in an impairment of the underlying goodwill and could result in an impairment of the indefinite lived intangible asset

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

as a multinational company with diverse product offerings we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices we evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting except within financing operations we leverage the companys diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize 

 

operational hedging activities over financial market instruments to the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities these financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument types and other hedging practices see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments 

derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk modeling the tests for interest rate currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the riskmanager™ valueatrisk model using a oneyear horizon and a 95 confidence level the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposures move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics™ dataset as of june 30 2018  in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetrics™ a reasonable proxy is included 

our market risk exposures relative to interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as discussed below have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period in addition we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term 

interest rate exposure on financial instruments interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the companys foreign net investments 

based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june 30 2018  including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates we believe a nearterm change in interest rates at a 95 confidence level based on historical interest rate movements would not materially affect our financial statements 

currency rate exposure on financial instruments because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months in addition we have entered into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions 

based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june 30 2018  we 

the procter  gamble company 31 

believe at a 95 confidence level based on historical currency rate movements the impact on such instruments of a nearterm change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements 

commodity price exposure on financial instruments we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors we may use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 

as of and during the years ended june 30 2018 and june 30 2017  we did not have any commodity hedging activity

financial information about segments 

as of june 30 2017  the company has five reportable segments under us gaap beauty  grooming  health care  fabric  home care  and baby feminine  family care  many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate while none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal components within certain reportable segments such as appliances grooming and personal health care health are seasonal 

additional information about our reportable segments can be found in the mda and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k quarterly and annual reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with the mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

the procter  gamble company 3 

our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets including foreign currency fluctuations currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility 

we are a global company with operations in approximately 70  countries and products sold in more than 180  countries and territories around the world we hold assets incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar and our operations outside the us generate a significant portion of our net revenue fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows we receive from nonus markets increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those markets negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition moreover discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries could adversely affect our results see also the results of operations and cash flow financial condition and liquidity sections of the mda and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

we also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with exchange import authorization pricing or other controls or restrictions including nigeria and ukraine our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas or if new or increased tariffs quotas exchange or price controls trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business 

additionally our business operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions including political instability or upheaval broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments particularly in emerging markets 

uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship which could adversely impact our business 

our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local regional or global economic disruptions such as a slowdown in the general economy reduced market growth rates tighter credit markets for our suppliers vendors or customers a significant shift in government policies or the inability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers vendors and suppliers additionally economic conditions may cause our suppliers distributors contractors or other third party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic 

 

conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles in addition if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow it could affect the company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments 

disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit 

a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital 

disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results 

our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements including for issues such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites discontinuity in our internal information and data systems inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials significant changes in trade policy natural disasters acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor transportation energy pension and healthcare therefore our business results are dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost saving projects and sourcing decisions while maintaining and improving margins and market share failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results 

our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits  

we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products achieving our business results depends in part on successfully developing introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends to obtain maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also successfully respond to technological advances made by and intellectual property rights granted to competitors failure to continually innovate improve and 

4         the procter  gamble company 

respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels 

the consumer products industry is highly competitive across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives and trade terms in addition evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics which for example may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models particularly ecommerce could negatively impact our results 

a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we sell most of our products via retail customers which include mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores distributors wholesalers baby stores specialty beauty stores ecommerce highfrequency stores and pharmacies our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the companys reputation and the reputation of our brands form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies including consumers customers and suppliers the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall productrelated litigation changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of 

 

counterfeit products additionally negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about safety quality ingredients efficacy or similar matters sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer our company also devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity the companys reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners and external business partners for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our third party relationships and the agreements under which our third party partners operate our financial results could suffer additionally while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our financial legal reputational and operational risk 

an information security incident including a cybersecurity breach or the failure of one or more key information technology systems networks hardware processes andor associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information technology it systems networks and services including internet and intranet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools physical security systems and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms many of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 



the procter  gamble company 5 

 numerous and evolving information security threats including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats pose a risk to the security of our it systems networks and services as well as to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations as cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally the company is continually increasing its attention to these threats we continue to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them including monitoring of networks and systems increasing information security skills deploying employee security training and updating security policies for the company and its thirdparty providers however because the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or mitigating harms after such an attack our it databases and systems and our thirdparty providers’ databases and systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing and other cyberattacks to date we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks however we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our thirdparty providers will prevent breaches operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our thirdparty providers’ databases or systems if the it systems networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations or if we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer a loss significant unavailability of key operations or disclosure of our sensitive business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security incidents and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive operational and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action the costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results 

changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results 

changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results for example the united kingdom’s decision to leave the european union has created uncertainty regarding among other things the uks future legal and economic framework and how the uk will interact with other countries including with respect to the free movement of goods services and people in addition results of elections referendums or other 

 

political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies laws and regulations may change including with respect to sanctions taxes the movement of goods services and people between countries and other matters the potential implications of such uncertainty which include among others exchange rate fluctuations and market contraction could adversely affect the company’s business and financial results 

we must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across all of the countries in which we do business including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property product liability marketing antitrust privacy environmental employment antibribery anticorruption tax accounting and financial reporting or other matters rapidly changing laws regulations and related interpretations as well as increased enforcement actions create challenges for the company including our compliance and ethics programs and may alter the environment in which we do business which could adversely impact our financial results if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws regulations and related interpretations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position furthermore if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

the company is subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions because the us maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us if those same foreign earnings are instead repatriated to the us additional residual us taxation will likely occur due to the us’s worldwide tax system and higher us corporate tax rate the us is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change the corporate tax rate and the us international tax rules additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving   as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements “beps recommended by the g8 g20 and organization for economic cooperation and development oecd as these and other tax laws and related regulations change our financial results could be materially impacted given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be 

6         the procter  gamble company 

cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 

furthermore we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities while we believe our tax positions will be sustained the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 beauty brands transaction with coty may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results 

we must successfully manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against our business objectives specifically our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands our financial results could also be impacted in the event of acquisitions or joint venture activities if 1 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 2 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change 

our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings while continuing to invest in business growth could adversely impact our financial results additionally successfully executing management transitions at leadership levels of the company and retention of key employees is critical to our business success we are generally a buildfromwithin company and 

 

our success is dependent on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans

economic conditions and uncertainties 

we discuss expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in annual and quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all such statements except for historical and present factual information are forwardlooking statements and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outofdate or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations for more information on risks that could impact our results refer to item 1a risk factors in this form 10k 

global economic conditions    current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic and any causes of market size contraction such as reduced gdp in commoditydependent economies greater political unrest in the middle east and central  eastern europe further economic instability in the european union political instability in certain latin american markets further economic slowdowns in japan and china and changes to international trade agreements in north america and elsewhere could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin in either case reducing our earnings 

changes in costs   our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts we have significant exposures to certain commodities in particular certain oilderived materials like resins and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs if we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements it may adversely impact our gross margin operating margin and net earnings sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products we strive to implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plans including outsourcing projects supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization as discussed later in this mda we initiated certain nonmanufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2017 we announced an additional multiyear cost reduction program these programs are resulting in significant enrollment and other savings if we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings 

foreign exchange   we have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the us dollar as their functional currency transaction exposures relate to 1 the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2 the revaluation of transactionrelated working capital balances 

 

denominated in currencies other than the functional currency over the past four years the us dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations like argentina egypt nigeria and the united kingdom have had and could continue to have a significant impact on our sales costs and earnings increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products which would affect our sales 

government policies   our net earnings could be affected by changes in us or foreign government tax policies for example the us is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the us tax treatment of international earnings additionally we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange import authorization and pricing controls such as nigeria and ukraine changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales operating margin and net earnings for example during fiscal 2015 the company deconsolidated its venezuelan subsidiaries due to evolving conditions that resulted in an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and us dollar and restricted our ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in us dollars 

results of operations 

the key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales gross margin selling general and administrative costs sga other nonoperating items and income taxes the primary factors driving yearoveryear changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete product initiatives competitive activities the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as pricing actions which can also indirectly impact volume changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the us 

most of our cost of products sold and sga are to some extent variable in nature accordingly our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute yearoveryear changes in total costs the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs energy and other commodities pricing impacts geographic mix for example gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products product mix for example the beauty segment has higher gross margins than the company average foreign exchange rate fluctuations in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments for example product or package improvements and to a lesser extent scale impacts for costs 

16         the procter  gamble company 

that are fixed or less variable in nature the primary drivers of sga are marketingrelated costs and nonmanufacturing overhead costs marketingrelated costs are primarily variable in nature although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies overhead costs are also variable in nature but on a relative basis less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth accordingly we generally experience more scalerelated impacts for these costs 

the company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain certain marketing activities and overhead expenses the plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work processes to fund the companys growth strategy

 total sga decreased 2  to 186 billion  as increased overhead and advertising spending were more than offset by a reduction in other operating expenses primarily due to a reduction in net foreign exchange transactional costs and gains on real estate sales sga as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points to 285  as a result of the decline in other operating expenses

 in addition to the gross margin expansion and decrease in sga as a percent of net sales discussed above operating margin also increased by 290 basis points in 2016 due to a 20 billion charge in 2015 related to the deconsolidation of the companys venezuelan subsidiaries

net earnings from discontinued operations increased 46 billion  in 2017  to 52 billion  this change was driven by the 53 billion gain on the sale of the beauty brands in the current year partially offset by the impact of the base period results which included the net earnings of the batteries and beauty brands businesses prior to divestiture a gain on the sale of the batteries business and impairment charges on the batteries business prior to divestiture see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

venezuela impacts 

there are a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions in venezuela which have evolved over time and may continue to evolve in the future these evolving conditions resulted in an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and us dollar and restricted our venezuelan operations’ ability to pay dividends or pay for certain raw and package materials finished goods and services denominated in us dollars for accounting purposes this resulted in a lack of control over our venezuelan subsidiaries therefore in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation effective

productivity and cost savings plan 

in 2012 the company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain research and development marketing and overheads the plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing 

24         the procter  gamble company 

and other work processes to fund the companys growth strategy in 2016 the company communicated additional multiyear productivity and cost savings targets in 2017 the company communicated specific elements of the productivity and cost savings targets 

as part of the original plan the company incurred approximately 56 billion  in beforetax restructuring costs over a sixyear period from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017  savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activities the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment through 2017  these costs and other nonmanufacturing enrollment reductions delivered approximately 29 billion  in annual beforetax gross savings 

the additional productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain certain marketing activities and overhead expenses as part of this plan the company expects to incur approximately 12 billion in total beforetax restructuring costs in fiscal 2018 and 2019 this program is expected to result in meaningful nonmanufacturing enrollment reductions along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes 

restructuring accruals of 277 million  as of june 30 2017  are classified as current liabilities during fiscal 2017  48  of the restructuring charges incurred either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuringtype activities the resulting charges are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting 

in addition to our restructuring programs we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins

cash flow financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses brands and geographies as necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations

fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016   

adjusted free cash flow was 98 billion in 2017  a decrease of 19 versus the prior year the decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flows adjusted free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the loss on debt extinguishment and impacts of the sale of the beauty brands was 94 in 2017  

fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015

investing cash flow 

fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016

longterm and shortterm debt   we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital total debt was 316 billion as of june 30 2017  and 306 billion as of june 30 2016  

treasury purchases   total share repurchases were 52 billion  in 2017  and 40 billion  in 2016  in addition the cash infusion of 17 billion  in the batteries divestiture was reflected as a purchase of treasury stock in 2016  

liquidity 

at june 30 2017  our current liabilities exceeded current assets by 37 billion largely due to shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs as of june 30 2017  150 billion of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities is held offshore by foreign subsidiaries amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation upon repatriation to the us under current law we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future of the june 30 2017  balance of offshore cash cash equivalents and marketable securities the majority relates to various western european countries as of june 30 2017  we did not have material cash cash equivalents and 

26         the procter  gamble company 

marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds 

we utilize short and longterm debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchases we have strong short and longterm debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets in addition we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that if needed should provide sufficient credit funding to meet shortterm financing requirements 

on june 30 2017  our shortterm credit ratings were p1 moodys and a1 standard  poors while our longterm credit ratings were aa3 moodys and aa standard  poors all with a stable outlook 

we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an 80 

 

billion facility split between a 32 billion fiveyear facility and a 48 billion 364day facility which expire in november 2021 and november 2017 respectively both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn these credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers nor do they have material adverse events clauses except at the time of signing in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities for additional details on debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual commitments 

the following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of june 30 2017  



 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require 

 

 a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include income taxes certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets we believe these accounting 

the procter  gamble company 27 

policies and others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company 

the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of 

certain deferred tax balances primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards and our ability to uphold certain tax positions 

realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods which involves business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment 

a core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities however because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various crossborder transactions we have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty we estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70 of our global earnings we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on

we sponsor various postemployment benefits throughout the world these include pension plans both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and other postemployment benefit opeb plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations as permitted by us gaap the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary opeb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for 2017  the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and opeb assets was 69 and 83 respectively a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and opeb assets would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 100 million 

since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses discount rates used for our us defined benefit pension and opeb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan for our international plans the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 24 represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a 10 change in the discount rate would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 200 million the average discount rate on the opeb plan of 39 reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the us which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits a 10 change in the discount rate would impact annual aftertax opeb expense by approximately 70 million for additional details on our defined benefit pension and opeb plans see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements

goodwill and intangible assets 

significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations we typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets the valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions overall category growth rates competitive activities cost containment and margin expansion company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows 

assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions for example future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in addition changes to or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses 

we test individual indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets the test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two step process in the first step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill the second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting units tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination if the resulting implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying value that difference represents an impairment 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands other acquired intangible assets eg certain brands all customer relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life 

 

is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives impairment assessment for determinablelived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested separately at least annually for impairment 

most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that at a minimum exceed two times their underlying carrying values certain of our goodwill reporting units in particular shave care and appliances are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high both of these whollyacquired reporting units have fair value cushions that currently exceed the underlying carrying values however the shave care cushion as well as the related gillette indefinitelived intangible asset cushion have been reduced to below 10 due in large part to an increased competitive market environment in the us a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the us dollar that have occurred in recent years and resulted in reduced cash flow projections as a result this unit is more susceptible to impairment risk from adverse changes in business operating plans category development and macroeconomic environment conditions including any further significant devaluation of major currencies relative to the us dollar while management has implemented strategies to address these events adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business units goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles carrying values of shave care goodwill and the gillette indefinitelived intangible asset as of june 30 2017 are 19 billion and 16 billion respectively

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

as a multinational company with diverse product offerings we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices we evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting except within financing operations we leverage the companys diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments to the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities these financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument types and other hedging practices see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments 

derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk modeling the tests for interest rate currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the corporatemanager™ valueatrisk model using a oneyear horizon and a 95 confidence level the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposures move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics™ dataset as of june 30 2017  in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetrics™ a reasonable proxy is included 

our market risk exposures relative to interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as discussed below have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period in addition we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term 

interest rate exposure on financial instruments   interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the companys foreign net investments 

based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june 30 2017  including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates we believe a nearterm change in interest rates at a 95 confidence level based on historical interest rate movements would not materially affect our financial statements 

currency rate exposure on financial instruments   because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates corporate policy prescribes the range of 

 

allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months in addition we have entered into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions 

based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june 30 2017  we believe at a 95 confidence level based on historical currency rate movements the impact on such instruments of a nearterm change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements 

commodity price exposure on financial instruments   we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors we may use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 

as of and during the years ended june 30 2017  and june 30 2016  we did not have any commodity hedging activity 

measures not defined by us gaap 

our discussion of financial results includes several nongaap financial measures we believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends ie trends excluding nonrecurring or unusual items and results and provide a supplemental measure of yearonyear results the nongaap measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes these measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their atrisk compensation these nongaap measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related gaap measure but rather as supplemental information to our business results these nongaap measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted these measures include 

organic sales growth   organic sales growth is a nongaap measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the venezuela deconsolidation acquisitions divestitures and foreign exchange from yearoveryear comparisons we believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for atrisk compensation

the following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth 



 adjusted free cash flow   adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding certain divestiture impacts tax payments related to certain divestitures adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion we view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investment 

 

the following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow  millions 



 adjusted free cash flow productivity   adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding batteries impairments the gain on the sale of the batteries and beauty brands businesses the loss on early debt extinguishment and the venezuela deconsolidation charges we view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand pg’s ability to generate cash adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes this measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for atrisk compensation the companys longterm target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent

 we do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of yearonyear results these items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their atrisk compensation

 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with the mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

the procter  gamble company 3 

our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets including foreign currency fluctuations currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility 

we are a global company with operations in approximately 70  countries and products sold in more than 180  countries and territories around the world we hold assets incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar and our operations outside the us generate a significant portion of our net revenue fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies such as the recent volatility in the russian ruble may reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows we receive from nonus markets increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those markets negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition moreover discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in different countries could adversely affect our results see also the results of operations and cash flow financial condition and liquidity sections of the mda and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

we also have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange import authorization pricing or other controls including argentina egypt nigeria and ukraine our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas or if new or increased tariffs quotas exchange or price controls trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business outside the us 

additionally our business operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions including political instability or upheaval broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments particularly in emerging markets 

uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship which could adversely impact our business 

our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local regional or global economic disruptions such as a slowdown in the general economy reduced market growth rates tighter credit markets for our suppliers vendors or customers or the inability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers vendors and suppliers additionally economic conditions may cause our suppliers distributors contractors or other third party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic 

 

conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow it could affect the company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments 

disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit 

a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital 

disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results 

our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of our previouslyannounced supply chain simplifications and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements including for issues such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials natural disasters acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor transportation energy pension and healthcare therefore our business results are dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost saving projects and sourcing decisions while maintaining and improving margins and market share failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results 

our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation  

we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products achieving our business results depends in part on successfully developing introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends to obtain maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances made by and intellectual property rights granted to competitors failure to continually innovate improve and 

4         the procter  gamble company 

respond to competitive moves could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels 

the consumer products industry is highly competitive across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins   to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives and trade terms in addition evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics which for example may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models particularly ecommerce could negatively impact our results 

a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we sell most of our products via retail customers which include mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores distributors baby stores specialty beauty stores ecommerce highfrequency stores and pharmacies our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets continued consolidation among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the companys reputation and the reputation of our brands form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies including consumers customers and suppliers the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall productrelated litigation changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of 

 

counterfeit products additionally negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about safety quality ingredients efficacy or similar matters sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer our company also devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity the companys reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners or external business partners for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our third party relationships and the agreements under which our third party partners operate our financial results could suffer additionally while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our financial legal reputational and operational risk 

an information security incident including a cybersecurity breach or the failure of one or more key information technology systems networks hardware processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information technology it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools physical security systems and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 



the procter  gamble company 5 

 numerous and evolving information security threats including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats pose a risk to the security of our it systems networks and services as well as to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and the availability and integrity of our critical business operations as cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally the company is continually increasing its sensitivity and attention to these threats we continue to assess potential threats and make investments seeking to address these threats including monitoring of networks and systems and upgrading skills employee training and security policies for the company and its thirdparty providers however because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures our it databases and systems and our third party providers databases and systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing and other cyberattacks to date we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks however we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third party providers will prevent breaches or breakdowns to our or our thirdparty providers’ databases or systems if the it systems networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations or if we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer a loss significant unavailability of or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action the costs and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant 

we must successfully manage compliance with legislation regulation and enforcement as well as pending legal matters in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across all of the countries in which we do business including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property product liability marketing antitrust privacy environmental employment antibribery or anticorruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act tax or other matters rapidly changing laws regulations and related interpretations including changes in accounting standards as well as increased enforcement actions create challenges for the company including our compliance and ethics programs and 

 

may alter the environment in which we do business which could adversely impact our financial results if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws regulations and related interpretations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position furthermore if pending legal matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results 

the company is subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions because the us maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us if those same foreign earnings are instead repatriated to the us additional residual us taxation will likely occur due to the us’s worldwide tax system and higher us corporate tax rate the us is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change the corporate tax rate and the us international tax rules additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project “beps undertaken by the g8 g20 and organization for economic cooperation and development oecd as these and other tax laws and related regulations change our financial results could be materially impacted given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 

if we are unable to successfully execute our portfolio optimization strategy as well as successfully manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities it could adversely impact our business 

in august 2014 the company announced a plan to significantly streamline our product portfolio by divesting discontinuing or consolidating about 100 nonstrategic brands resulting in a portfolio of about 65 brands the company has announced the beauty brands transaction with coty and completed a series of other transactions that will substantially complete this plan our ability to successfully execute our portfolio optimization strategy could impact our results 

in addition as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against our business 

6         the procter  gamble company 

objectives specifically our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands our financial results could also be impacted in the event of acquisitions or joint venture activities if 1 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 2 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change 

our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings while continuing to invest in business growth could adversely impact our financial results additionally successfully executing management transitions at leadership levels of the company and retention of key employees is critical to our business success we are generally a buildfromwithin company and our success is dependent on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans 

the united kingdom’s departure from the european union could adversely impact our business and financial results 

on june 23 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which a majority of voters voted for the united kingdom to exit the   european union “brexit” the announcement of which resulted in significant currency exchange   rate fluctuations and volatility in global stock markets it is expected that the british government will commence negotiations to determine the terms of brexit given   the lack of comparable precedent the implications of brexit or how such implications might affect the company are unclear brexit could among other things disrupt trade and the free movement of goods services and   people between the united kingdom and the european union or other countries as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty these and other potential implications of brexit could adversely affect the company’s business and financial results

economic conditions and uncertainties 

we discuss expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in annual and quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all such statements except for historical and present factual information are forwardlooking statements and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outofdate or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations for more information on risks that could impact our results refer to item 1a risk factors in this form 10k 

global economic conditions    current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic and any causes of market size contraction such as reduced gdp in commodityproducing economies as commodity prices decline greater political unrest in the middle east and eastern europe further economic instability in the european union political instability in certain latin american markets and economic slowdowns in japan and china could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin in either case reducing our earnings 

changes in costs   our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts we have significant exposures to certain commodities in particular certain oilderived materials like resins and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs if we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements it may adversely impact our gross margin operating margin and net earnings sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products we strive to implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plans including outsourcing projects supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization as discussed later in the mda we initiated certain nonmanufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in 2012 if we are not successful in executing these changes there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings 

foreign exchange   we have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the us dollar as their functional currency transaction exposures relate to 1 the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2 the revaluation of transactionrelated working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in 2016 2015 and 2014 the us dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and 

 

earnings from these foreign exchange impacts certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations like argentina brazil canada egypt mexico nigeria russia and turkey have had and could have a significant impact on our sales costs and earnings increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products which would affect our sales 

government policies   our net earnings could be affected by changes in us or foreign government tax policies for example the us may consider corporate tax reform that could significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the us tax treatment of international earnings additionally we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange import authorization and pricing controls such as argentina egypt nigeria and ukraine changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales operating margin and net earnings 

results of operations 

the key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales gross margin selling general and administrative costs sga other nonoperating items and income taxes the primary factors driving yearoveryear changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete product initiatives the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as pricing actions which can also indirectly impact volume changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the us 

most of our cost of products sold and sga are to some extent variable in nature accordingly our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute yearoveryear changes in total costs the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs energy and other commodities pricing impacts geographic mix for example gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products product mix for example the beauty segment has higher gross margins than the company average foreign exchange rate fluctuations in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature the primary drivers of sga are marketingrelated costs and nonmanufacturing overhead costs marketingrelated costs are primarily variable in nature although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies overhead costs are also variable in nature but on a relative basis less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth accordingly we generally experience more scalerelated impacts for these costs

venezuela impacts 

there are a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions in venezuela which have evolved over time and may continue to evolve in the future these evolving conditions resulted in an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and us dollar and restricted our venezuelan operations’ ability to pay dividends or pay for certain raw and package materials finished goods and services denominated in us dollars for accounting purposes this resulted in a lack of control over our venezuelan subsidiaries therefore in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation effective june 30 2015 we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting this resulted in a writeoff of all of the net assets of our venezuelan subsidiaries along with venezuela related assets held by other subsidiaries beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2016 our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive payments from venezuela accordingly we no longer include the results of our venezuelan subsidiaries’ operations in our financial results

productivity and cost savings plan 

in 2012 the company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain research and development marketing and overheads the plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing 

 

and other work processes to fund the companys growth strategy 

as part of this plan the company expects to incur approximately 55 billion  in beforetax restructuring costs over a sixyear period from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017 through the end of fiscal 2016  89  of the expected costs have been incurred savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activities the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment overall these costs and other nonmanufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver approximately 30 billion  in annual beforetax gross savings the cumulative beforetax savings realized through 2016  were approximately 24 billion  

restructuring accruals of 315 million  as of june 30 2016  are classified as current liabilities during fiscal 2016  51  of the restructuring charges incurred either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuringtype activities the resulting charges are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting 

in addition to our restructuring programs we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins

cash flow financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses brands and geographies as necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating cash flow

operating cash flow was 154 billion in 2016  a 6 increase from the prior year net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation deferred income taxes lossgain on sale of businesses and impairment charges generated 136 billion of operating cash

 fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014   

operating cash flow was 146 billion in 2015  a 5 increase from the prior year operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation deferred income taxes impairment charges gains on sale of businesses and the venezuela deconsolidation charge and a decrease in working capital partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities 

 adjusted free cash flow   we view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investment it is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding certain divestiture impacts tax payments in the prior year for the pet care divestiture and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their atrisk compensation 

 

fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015   

adjusted free cash flow was 121 billion in 2016  an increase of 4 versus the prior year the increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows and decrease in capital spending adjusted free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the impairment charges and gain on the sale of the batteries business was 115 in 2016  

fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014

acquisitions  acquisition activity was not material in 2016  or 2015  

proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales proceeds from asset sales in 2016  contributed 432 million in cash primarily from plant asset sales and other minor brand divestitures proceeds from asset sales contributed 45 billion in cash in 2015  primarily from the sale of our pet care business the sale of our chinese battery venture and other minor brand divestitures 

financing cash flow 

dividend payments   our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments dividends per common share increased 3 to 266 per share in 2016  total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were 74 billion in 2016  and 73 billion in 2015  in april 2016 the board of directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from 06629 to 06695 per share on common stock and series a and b esop convertible class a preferred stock this represents a 1 increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 60th consecutive year that our dividend has increased we 

the procter  gamble company 25 

have paid a dividend for 126 years every year since our incorporation in 1890 

longterm and shortterm debt   we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital total debt was 306 billion as of june 30 2016  and 303 billion as of june 30 2015  

treasury purchases   total share repurchases were 40 billion in 2016  and 46 billion in 2015  in addition the cash infusion of 17 billion in the batteries divestiture was reflected as a purchase of treasury stock 

liquidity 

at june 30 2016  our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 30 billion largely due to current assets and current liabilities of the beauty brands business held for sale excluding current assets and current liabilities of the beauty brands business held for sale our current liabilities exceeded current assets by 18 billion largely due to shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs as of june 30 2016  110 billion of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities is held offshore by foreign subsidiaries amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the us we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future of the june 30 2016  balance of offshore cash cash equivalents and marketable securities the majority relates to various western european countries as of june 30 2016  we did not have material cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds 

 

we utilize short and longterm debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchases we have strong short and longterm debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets in addition we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that if needed should provide sufficient credit funding to meet shortterm financing requirements 

on june 30 2016  our shortterm credit ratings were p1 moodys and a1 standard  poors while our longterm credit ratings were aa3 moodys and aa standard  poors all with a stable outlook 

we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an 80 billion facility split between a 32 billion fiveyear facility and a 48 billion 364day facility which expire in november 2020 and november 2016 respectively the 364day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn these credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers nor do they have material adverse events clauses except at the time of signing in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities for additional details on debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity

contractual commitments 

the following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of june 30 2016  



 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include income taxes certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company 

the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of 

 

certain deferred tax balances primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards and our ability to uphold certain tax positions 

realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods which involves business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment 

our operating principles are that our tax structure is based on our business operating model such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities however we may have income tax exposure related to the determination of the appropriate transfer prices 

the procter  gamble company 27 

for our various crossborder transactions we obtain advance rulings with tax authorities to support our positions where possible to help manage these exposures nonetheless many of the underlying transactions are subject to audit resulting in uncertainty until the ultimate audit resolution we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate for additional details on the companys income taxes see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

employee benefits 

we sponsor various postemployment benefits throughout the world these include pension plans both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and other postemployment benefit opeb plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations as permitted by us gaap the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary opeb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for 2016  the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and opeb assets was 72 and 83 respectively a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and opeb assets would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 100 million 

 

since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses discount rates used for our us defined benefit pension and opeb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan for our international plans the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans of 21 and 36 respectively represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a 100 basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual aftertax defined benefit pension expense by approximately 200 million a change in the opeb discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual aftertax opeb expense by approximately 86 million for additional details on our defined benefit pension and opeb plans see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets 

significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 

we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles economic barriers to entry a brands relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands other acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors all of our acquired technology and customerrelated intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives

the costs of determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that at a minimum exceed two times their underlying carrying values certain of our continuing goodwill reporting units in particular shave care and appliances are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high while both of these whollyacquired reporting units have fair value cushions that currently exceed the underlying carrying values the shave care cushion as well as certain of the related indefinitelived intangible assets have been reduced to below 20 due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the us dollar that began in recent years and continued during fiscal 2016 as a result this unit is more susceptible to impairment risk from adverse changes in business operating plans and macroeconomic environment conditions including any further significant devaluation of major currencies relative to the us dollar any such adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business units goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

the business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions overall category growth rates competitive activities cost containment and margin expansion and company business plans we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable changes to or a failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

as a multinational company with diverse product offerings we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices we evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting except within financing operations we leverage the companys diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments to the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities these financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument types and other hedging practices see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments 

derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk modeling the tests for interest rate currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the corporatemanager™ valueatrisk model using a oneyear horizon and a 95 confidence level the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposures move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics™ dataset as of june 30 2016  in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetrics™ a reasonable proxy is included 

our market risk exposures relative to interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as discussed below have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period in addition we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term 

interest rate exposure on financial instruments   interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the companys foreign net investments 

the procter  gamble company 29 

based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june 30 2016  including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates we believe a nearterm change in interest rates at a 95 confidence level based on historical interest rate movements would not materially affect our financial statements 

currency rate exposure on financial instruments   because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months in addition we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions 

based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june 30 2016  we believe at a 95 confidence level based on historical currency rate movements the impact on such instruments of a nearterm change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements 

commodity price exposure on financial instruments   we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors we may use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 

as of and during the years ended june 30 2016  and june 30 2015  we did not have any commodity hedging activity 

measures not defined by us gaap 

our discussion of financial results includes several nongaap financial measures we believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends ie trends excluding nonrecurring or unusual items and results and provide a supplemental measure of yearonyear results the nongaap measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes these measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their atrisk compensation these nongaap measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related gaap measure but rather as supplemental information to our business results these nongaap measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted these measures include 

organic sales growth   organic sales growth is a nongaap measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the venezuela deconsolidation acquisitions divestitures and 

 

foreign exchange from yearoveryear comparisons we believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for atrisk compensation 

the following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth 



 core eps   core eps is a measure of the companys diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated management views these nongaap measures as a useful supplemental measure of company performance over time the table below provides a reconciliation of revised diluted net earnings per share to core eps including the following reconciling items 



30         the procter  gamble company 

accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation effective june 30 2015 we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting the charge was incurred to write off our net assets related to venezuela 

 we do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of yearonyear results 

 adjusted free cash flow   adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending excluding tax payments related to the divestiture of the discontinued pet business adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion we view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investment 

 

the following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow  millions 



 adjusted free cash flow productivity   adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding batteries impairments the gain on the sale of the batteries business and venezuela charges we view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand pg’s ability to generate cash adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes the companys longterm target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent

financial information about segments 

as of june 30 2015  the company has five reportable segments under us gaap beauty hair and personal care  grooming  health care  fabric care and home care  and baby feminine and family care  many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate while none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal components within certain reportable segments such as appliances grooming and prestige fragrances beauty hair and personal care are seasonal

 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with the mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

the procter  gamble company 14 

our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets including foreign currency fluctuations currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility 

we are a global company with operations in approximately 70  countries and products sold in more than 180  countries and territories around the world we hold assets incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar and our operations outside the us generate a significant portion of our net revenue fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies such as the recent volatility in the russian ruble may reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows we receive from nonus markets increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition moreover discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in different countries could adversely affect our results see also the results of operations and cash flow financial condition and liquidity sections of the mda and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

we also have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange import authorization pricing or other controls including argentina china egypt greece india nigeria ukraine and venezuela our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and repatriate earnings from overseas or if new or increased tariffs quotas exchange or price controls trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business outside the us such as the current year impact of deconsolidating our venezuelan subsidiaries as discussed in this form 10k 

additionally our business operations or employees may be affected by political volatility labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions including political instability or upheaval broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments particularly in emerging markets which could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 

uncertain global economic conditions including disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit rating may adversely impact demand for our products cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship or reduce our access to credit all of which could adversely impact our business 

our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local regional or global economic disruptions such as a slowdown in the general economy reduced market growth rates tighter credit markets for our suppliers vendors or customers or the inability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers vendors and suppliers additionally economic conditions may cause our suppliers distributors contractors or other third party partners to suffer financial difficulties that 

 

they cannot overcome resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow it could affect the company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments 

a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital 

disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results 

our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of our previouslyannounced supply chain simplifications and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements including for issues such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials natural disasters acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor transportation energy pension and healthcare therefore our business results are dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost saving projects and sourcing decisions while maintaining and improving margins and market share in addition our financial projections include cost savings described in our announced productivity plan failure to manage these fluctuations and deliver the planned cost savings could adversely impact our financial results 

our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation  

we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products achieving our business results depends in part on successfully developing introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends to obtain maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid 

15     the procter  gamble company 

infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances made by and intellectual property rights granted to competitors failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels 

the consumer products industry is highly competitive across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins this includes among other things increasing competition from mid and lowertier value products including privatelabel products in both developed and developing markets to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives and trade terms in addition the emergence of new sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and effectively compete in new sales channels could negatively impact our results 

a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we sell most of our products via retail customers which include mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores salons distributors ecommerce and highfrequency stores our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets continued consolidation among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the companys reputation and the reputation of our brands form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies including consumers customers and suppliers the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its 

 

reputation due to a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products additionally negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about safety quality efficacy or similar matters sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer our company also devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity the companys reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners or external business partners for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our third party relationships and the agreements under which our third party partners operate our financial results could suffer additionally while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our financial legal reputational and operational risk 

a breach of information security including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks hardware processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information technology it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to

 numerous and evolving information security threats including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats pose a risk to the security of our it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data as cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally the company is continually increasing its sensitivity and attention to these threats we continue to assess potential threats and make investments seeking to address these threats including monitoring of networks and systems and upgrading skills employee training and security policies for the company and its thirdparty providers however because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures our it systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts phishing and other cyberattacks to date we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks however we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns to our or our thirdparty providers’ databases or systems if the it systems networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or if we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer a loss significant unavailability of or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action the costs and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant 

we must successfully manage compliance with legislation regulation and enforcement as well as pending legal matters in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across all of the countries in which we do business including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property product liability marketing antitrust privacy environmental employment antibribery or anticorruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or other matters rapidly changing laws regulations and related interpretations including changes in accounting standards as well as increased enforcement actions create challenges for our compliance and ethics programs and may alter the environment in which we do business if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws regulations and related interpretations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

 

furthermore if pending legal matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results 

the company is subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions because the us maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us if those same foreign earnings are instead repatriated to the us additional residual us taxation will likely occur due to the us’s worldwide tax system and higher us corporate tax rate the us is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change the corporate tax rate and the us international tax rules additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving    such as the base erosion and profit shifting project “beps currently being undertaken by the g8 g20 and organization for economic cooperation and development oecd as these and other tax laws and related regulations change our financial results could be materially impacted given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 

if we are unable to successfully execute our portfolio optimization strategy as well as successfully manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities it could adversely impact our business 

in august 2014 the company announced a plan to significantly streamline our product portfolio by divesting discontinuing or consolidating about 100 nonstrategic brands resulting in a portfolio of about 65 brands the company has announced a series of transactions that will substantially complete this plan it will take time to execute this plan and our ability to successfully do so could impact our results 

in addition as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against our business objectives specifically our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands our financial results could also be impacted in the event of acquisitions or joint venture activities if 1 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 2 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets 

17     the procter  gamble company 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change 

our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement including those described in our announced productivity plan and our portfoliooptimization strategy if we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth our financial results could be adversely impacted we expect these types of changes which will include staffing adjustments as well as employee departures to continue for the foreseeable future successfully executing these changes including effective management transitions at leadership levels of the company and retention of key employees is critical to our business success we are generally a buildfromwithin company and our success is dependent on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense it also includes continued development and execution of robust leadership succession plans including successful execution of our recently announced ceo transition

our value creation progress is measured internally with the operating total shareholder return otsr model over time 

25     the procter  gamble company 

otsr performance is highly correlated with market total shareholder returns otsr is a balanced measure that requires strong performance across the three primary drivers of value creation sales growth profit margin expansion and efficient utilization of assets to generate strong reliable operating cash flow we operationalize otsr deep within the company by defining tight linkages between business activities and the key drivers of value creation from strategic choices of global business units brands and country teams down to individual employees’ daily work plans 

the company has recently undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and brands that are structurally attractive and that play to pg strengths this will enable us to allocate resources to leading brands  marketed in the right set of countries channels and customers  where the size of the prize and probability of winning is highest when the major portion of this work is complete we expect to compete in four industrybased sectors made up of approximately ten product categories and 65 leading brands 

innovation has always been  and continues to be  pgs lifeblood to consistently win with consumers around the world across price tiers and preferences and to consistently win versus our best competitors each pg product category needs a full portfolio of innovation including a mix of commercial programs product improvements and gamechanging 

 

innovations we are also innovating to improve our category brand and market business models to better serve consumers and customers 

productivity is a core strength for pg which creates flexibility to fund our growth efforts offset cost challenges andor improve operating margins we have taken significant steps to accelerate productivity and savings across all elements of costs including cost of goods sold marketing expense and nonmanufacturing overhead these efforts are yielding significant benefits to our operating margin 

finally we are focused on improving execution and operating discipline in everything we do operating discipline and execution have always been  and must continue to be  core capabilities and competitive advantages for pg 

the company expects the delivery of the following longterm annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group 

 in periods with significant macroeconomic pressures we will maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the longterm health of our businesses to meet shortterm objectives in any given year

economic conditions and uncertainties 

we discuss expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in annual and quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all such statements except for historical and present factual information are forwardlooking statements and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outofdate or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations for more information on risks that could impact our results refer to item 1a risk factors in this 10k 

global economic conditions    current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic and any causes of market size contraction such as greater political unrest in the middle east and eastern europe further economic instability in the european union political instability in certain latin american markets and economic slowdowns in japan and china could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin in either case reducing our earnings 

changes in costs   our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts we have significant exposures to certain commodities in particular certain oilderived materials like resins and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs if we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements it may adversely impact our gross margin operating margin and net earnings sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products we strive to implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plans including outsourcing projects supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization as discussed later in this mda we initiated certain nonmanufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in 2012 if we are not successful in executing these changes there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings 

foreign exchange   we have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the us dollar as their functional currency transaction exposures relate to 1 the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2 the revaluation of transactionrelated working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in 2015 and 2014 the us dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts certain 

 

countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations like russia ukraine japan and switzerland have had and could have an additional significant impact on our sales costs and earnings increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products which would affect our sales 

government policies   our net earnings could be affected by changes in us or foreign government tax policies for example the us is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the us tax treatment of international earnings additionally we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange import authorization and pricing controls such as argentina china egypt greece india nigeria ukraine and venezuela changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales operating margin and net earnings during fiscal 2015 the company deconsolidated its venezuelan subsidiaries due to evolving conditions that have resulted in an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and us dollar and have restricted our ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in us dollars 

results of operations 

the key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales gross margin sga other nonoperating items and income taxes the primary factors driving yearoveryear changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete product initiatives the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as pricing actions which can also indirectly impact volume changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the us 

most of our cost of products sold and sga are to some extent variable in nature accordingly our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute yearoveryear changes in total costs the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs energy and other commodities pricing impacts geographic mix for example gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products product mix for example the beauty hair and personal care segment has higher gross margins than the company average foreign exchange rate fluctuations in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature the primary drivers of sga are marketingrelated costs and nonmanufacturing overhead costs marketingrelated costs are primarily variable in nature although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other 

27     the procter  gamble company 

marketing efficiencies overhead costs are also variable in nature but on a relative basis less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth accordingly we generally experience more scalerelated impacts for these costs 

the company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain marketing and overhead expenses the plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work processes to fund the companys growth strategy 

net sales 

fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 

net sales decreased 5 to 763 billion in 2015 on a 1 decrease in unit volume versus the prior year period volume grew low single digits in fabric care and home care volume decreased low single digits in baby feminine and family care grooming and health care and decreased midsingle digits in beauty hair and personal care volume increased low single digits in developed regions and declined low single digits in developing regions due in part to pricing actions to address 

 

foreign exchange devaluations unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6 while higher pricing drove a 2 favorable impact on net sales organic volume decreased 1 and organic sales grew 1 driven by higher pricing 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

net sales increased less than half a percent to 805 billion in 2014 on a 3 increase in unit volume versus the prior year period fabric care and home care along with baby feminine and family care volume grew midsingle digits grooming and health care volume grew low single digits beauty hair and personal care volume was unchanged volume increased low single digits in developed regions and grew midsingle digits in developing regions unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3 organic sales grew 3 driven by the unit volume increase a 1 favorable impact from higher pricing was offset by a 1 impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix due to higher relative growth of developing regions which have lower than average selling prices and of lower priced product categories such as fabric care and baby care 

operating costs 



fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 

gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 490 of net sales in 2015 gross margin benefited from a 200 basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings and a 90 basis point benefit from higher pricing these impacts were offset by a 140 basis point impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix primarily from a decline in the prestige business which has higher than average margins and within the fabric care and home care and grooming segments additional offsets include a 40 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange a 40 basis point impact from costs related to initiatives and capacity investments a 30 basis point impact from higher restructuring costs and smaller impacts from lower volume scale and higher commodity costs 

total sga decreased 5 to 236 billion as reduced overhead and marketing spending was partially offset by increased foreign exchange transaction charges sga as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 309 as the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and inflationary 

 

impacts were partially offset by cost savings efforts marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points behind lower spending due to efficiency efforts overhead spending as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points as productivity savings of 60 basis points from reduced overhead spending were more than offset by wage inflation investments in research and development the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and higher restructuring costs increased foreign exchange transaction charges added approximately 30 basis points to sga as a percentage of net sales as current year foreign currency transaction charges from revaluing receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than a local entity’s functional currency were partially offset by lower yearonyear charges for venezuela remeasurement and devaluation 

during fiscal 2015 the company incurred a 20 billion 21 billion after tax charge related to the deconsolidation of its venezuelan subsidiaries see the “venezuela impacts” later in the results of operations section 

the procter  gamble company 28 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

gross margin contracted 100  basis points to 491  of net sales in 2014 the decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a 150 basis point impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix a 50 basis point impact from higher commodity costs and a 90 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange partially offset by manufacturing cost savings of 190 basis points and a 40 basis point benefit from higher pricing the unfavorable geographic and product mix was caused by disproportionate growth in developing regions and the fabric care and home care and baby feminine and family care segments which have lower gross margins than the company average 

total sga decreased 5  to  248 billion  in 2014 due to a reduction in marketing spending overhead expense impairment charges and restructuring costs sga as a percentage of net sales decreased 170  basis points to 308  lower restructuring spending drove 30 basis points of the decline marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points primarily due to lower spending behind a focus on more efficient marketing support and scale benefits from increased net sales overhead spending decreased 50 basis points from productivity savings impairment charges were 40 basis points in 2013 but were zero in 2014 charges for the 2014 foreign currency policy changes in venezuela were comparable to the 2013 venezuela devaluation impact

income taxes 

fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 

the effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 350 basis points to 246 in 2015 mainly due to the nondeductibility of the 20 billion venezuelan deconsolidation charge the rate increase caused by lower current year favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions the net benefit was 80 basis points in the current year versus 160 basis points in the prior year was largely offset by a decrease related to favorable geographic earnings mix 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

the effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 170 basis points to 211 in 2014 the primary driver of this rate decline was approximately 320 basis points from the favorable geographic mix of earnings and approximately 60 basis points due to the nondeductibility of the 2013 impairment charges related to our appliances business these impacts were partially offset by a 50 basis point increase due to the venezuela currency policy changes and devaluation discussed below which decreased the prior year rate 20 basis points and increased the current year rate by 30 basis points a 110 basis point increase due to the tax impacts of acquisition and divestiture activities the gains from the purchase of the balance of the baby care and feminine care joint venture in iberia and the sale of our italy bleach business in 2013 and a 30 basis point increase due to the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions the net benefit 2014 was 228 million or 160 basis points versus 190 basis points of net benefit in 2013 

net earnings 

fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 

net earnings from continuing operations decreased 24 billion or 21 to 89 billion due to the 21 billion after tax charge related to the deconsolidation of venezuelan subsidiaries and the decline in net sales partially offset by reduced selling general and administrative costs sga foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately 14 billion in 2015 due to the weakening of certain key currencies against the us dollar primarily in russia ukraine venezuela and argentina partially offset by lower aftertax charges related to balance sheet remeasurement charges in venezuela 

29     the procter  gamble company 

net earnings from discontinued operations decreased 23 billion in 2015 due primarily to 21 billion of after tax impairment charges in our batteries business see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and the absence of fiscal 2015 earnings from our divested pet care business net earnings attributable to procter  gamble decreased 46 billion or 40 to 70 billion 

diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 080 or 21 to 306 due to the decrease in net earnings we had a diluted net loss per share from discontinued operations of 062 due primarily to the impairment charges on the batteries business this was a reduction of 078 per share versus the prior year diluted net earnings per share decreased 157 or 39 to 244

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

net earnings from continuing operations increased 365 million or 3 to 113 billion in 2014 due to the increase in sales and a 40basis point expansion in net earnings margin the increase in net earnings margin was primarily driven by the decrease in sga as a percentage of net sales and the lower tax rate partially offset by the gross margin contraction and the acquisition and divestituredriven net reduction in other nonoperating income net 

net earnings from discontinued operations increased 18 million in 2014 due to stronger results in our batteries business offsetting the ongoing impacts of prior year product recalls in pet care net earnings attributable to procter  gamble increased 331 million or 3 to 116 billion

venezuela impacts 

effective june 30 2015 the company deconsolidated its local venezuelan operations from our consolidated financial statements    pg has operated in venezuela for over 65 years and remains committed to serving venezuelan consumers with our leading brands and products to grow our business we expect our operations in venezuela will continue for the foreseeable future we continue to work proactively with the venezuelan official agencies to ensure we fully understand and remain compliant as the policies within which our venezuelan subsidiaries operate evolve we do not expect this change in accounting to directly affect the local operations of our venezuelan subsidiaries  

there are a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions in venezuela which have evolved over time and may continue to evolve in the future these evolving conditions have resulted in an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and us dollar and have restricted our venezuelan operations’ ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in us dollars for accounting purposes this has resulted in a lack of control over our venezuelan subsidiaries therefore in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation effective june 30 2015 we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting this change resulted in a fourth quarter fiscal 2015 onetime beforetax charge of 20 billion 21 billion after tax or 071 per share in future periods our financial results will only include sales of finished goods to our venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive payments from venezuela expected to be largely through the cencoex exchange market accordingly we will no longer include the results of our venezuelan subsidiaries’ operations in future reporting periods see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements our operations in venezuela accounted for less than 2 of consolidated net sales and earnings from continuing operations before the deconsolidation charge during fiscal 2015 

venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under us gaap as a result prior to deconsolidation the us dollar had been the functional currency for our subsidiaries in venezuela a number of changes have been initiated in the venezuelan exchange rate system including changes that resulted in devaluations to their currency prior to deconsolidation currency remeasurement adjustments for nondollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by our venezuelan subsidiaries along with any other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses have been reflected in earnings and totaled 104 million 275 million and 236 million on an aftertax basis in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

there are currently three official exchange rate mechanisms in venezuela the cencoex national center for external commerce exchange rate is 63 venezuelan bolivares fuerte vef per dollar and can be used for the importation of certain qualifying products and materials sicad complementary 

the procter  gamble company 30 

system for foreign exchange administration is an auctionbased exchange program applicable to foreign investment transactions and certain other qualifying imports of finished goods and materials the rate available through sicad was 106 vef per dollar at june 30 2014 and 128 vef per dollar at june 30 2015 a third exchange mechanism referred to as simadi sistema marginal de divisas is also an auctionbased program recently trading at approximately 200 vef per dollar 

through december 31 2013 venezuela had only one officially established exchange rate for qualifying dividends and imported goods and services the cencoex rate previously cadivi foreign exchange administrative commission accordingly through december 31 2013 our results in venezuela and all of our net monetary assets were measured at this exchange rate on january 24 2014 a number of announcements were made affecting currency exchange rate and other controls including the introduction of the sicad and sicad ii exchange rate mechanisms in addition based on local regulatory guidance we had expected dividends to be executed under the sicad rate accordingly beginning in 

 

january 2014 other than transactions flowing through cencoex our historical operations and balance sheet positions were generally measured using the sicad rate in january 2015 additional announcements were made relating to currency exchange rate and other controls including the elimination of the sicad ii exchange rate and the introduction of the simadi rate 

a significant portion of our imports have historically qualified for the cencoex rate while we continue to import certain materials and products under this rate payments for such qualifying imports have declined in recent years at this time there is considerable uncertainty as to how cencoex will operate in the future including the nature and quantity of transactions that will continue to flow through cencoex however we believe a portion of our imports will continue to qualify for the preferential rate we have had no recent access to the sicad market for imports or dividends to date we have had limited access to the simadi market our plans and ability to access that market in the future is unclear 

segment results 

segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation the results of these reportable segments do not include certain nonbusiness unit specific costs such as interest expense investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs these costs are reported in our corporate segment and are included as part of our corporate segment discussion additionally as described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in corporate all references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations

corporate 



corporate includes certain operating and nonoperating activities not allocated to specific business units these include the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level financing and investing activities other general corporate items the historical gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories certain asset impairment charges certain balance sheet impacts from significant foreign exchange devaluations and certain restructuringtype activities to maintain a competitive cost structure including manufacturing and workforce optimization corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies 

 

used in the segments to us gaap the most significant reconciling item is income taxes to adjust from blended statutory tax rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall company effective tax rate 

net sales in corporate decreased by 271 million in the current year primarily due to the prior year divestiture of the mdvip business corporate net expenses from continuing operations increased 20 billion in 2015 primarily due the charge related to the deconsolidation of the venezuelan subsidiaries increased foreign exchange transactional charges and incremental restructuring charges which were partially offset by gains on minor brand divestitures

productivity and cost savings plan 

in 2012 the company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain research and development marketing and overheads the plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work processes to fund the companys growth strategy 

as part of this plan the company expects to incur in excess of 50 billion  in beforetax restructuring costs over a sixyear period from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017 approximately 78  of the costs have been incurred through the end of fiscal 2015 savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activities the corollary benefits achieved eg enrollment reduction achieved via normal attrition the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment overall these costs and other nonmanufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver approximately 30 billion in annual beforetax gross savings the cumulative beforetax savings realized through 2015 were approximately 21 billion  

restructuring accruals of 389 million as of june 30 2015 are classified as current liabilities approximately 70 of the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2015 either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuringtype activities the resulting charges are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting 

in addition to our restructuring programs we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins

cash flow financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses brands and geographies as necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating cash flow 

fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 

operating cash flow was 146 billion in 2015 a 5 increase from the prior year operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation deferred income taxes impairment charges gains on sale of businesses and the venezuela deconsolidation charge and a decrease in working capital partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities reduced accounts receivable generated 349 million of cash due to changes in customer terms and improved collection results the number of days sales outstanding decreased 5 days due to foreign exchange impacts and improvements in collection results and customer terms lower inventory generated 313 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs inventory days on hand decreased 7 days due to foreign exchange impacts supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs accounts payable accrued and other liabilities increased generating 928 million in operating cash flow primarily driven by extended payment terms other operating assets and liabilities utilized 976 million of cash primarily to eliminate the deferred tax impacts associated with the pet care divestiture 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

operating cash flow was 140 billion in 2014 a 6 decrease from the prior year which was primarily driven by a 10 billion discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation deferred income taxes and gains on sale of businesses partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities working capital changes did not have a significant impact on operating cash flow in 2014 

 

reduced accounts receivable generated 87 million of cash primarily due to improved collection results which along with the timing and mix of sales late in the period drove a 1 day decrease in accounts receivable days sales outstanding inventory changes did not significantly impact operating cash flow as inventory management improvement efforts offset inventory needed to support product initiatives and build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes inventory days on hand decreased by 3 days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts accounts payable accrued and other liabilities also did not significantly impact operating cash flow other operating assets and liabilities utilized 16 billion of cash primarily driven by 10 billion of cash used for a discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan 

adjusted free cash flow   we view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investment it is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding certain divestiture impacts tax payments in the current year for the pet care divestiture and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their atrisk compensation 

fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 

adjusted free cash flow was 116 billion in 2015 an increase of 15 versus the prior year the increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows adjusted free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges on the batteries business and the venezuelan deconsolidation charge was 102 in 2015 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

adjusted free cash flow was 101 billion in 2014 a decrease of 7 versus the prior year the decrease was driven by the decrease in operating cash flows which was primarily due to a 10 billion discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan adjusted free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges from divested businesses was 86 in 2014 

investing cash flow 

fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 

net investing activities consumed 29 billion in cash in 2015 mainly due to capital spending net purchases of availableforsale securities and a reduction in cash due to venezuela deconsolidation partially offset by asset sales 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

net investing activities consumed 41 billion in cash in 2014 mainly due to capital spending and cash paid for investments in availableforsale securities partially offset by asset sales 

capital spending   we manage capital spending to support our business growth plans and have cost controls to deliver our cash generation targets capital expenditures primarily to

support capacity expansion innovation and cost efficiencies were 37 billion in 2015 and 38 billion in 2014 capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 49 in 2015 capital spending as a percentage of net sales in 2014 decreased 10 basis points versus 2013 to 48 

acquisitions  acquisition activity was not material in 2015 or 2014 

proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales proceeds from asset sales in 2015 contributed 45 billion in cash primarily from the sale of our pet care business the sale of our chinese battery venture and other minor brand divestitures proceeds from asset sales contributed 570 million in cash in 2014 mainly due to minor brand divestiture activities including mdvip the pert business in latin america and the bleach business in europe imea and latin america 

financing cash flow 

dividend payments   our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments dividends per common share increased 6 to 259 per share in 2015 total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were 73 billion in 2015 and 69 billion in 2014 in april 2015 the board of directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from 06436 to 06629 per share on common stock and series a and b esop convertible class a preferred stock this represents a 3 increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 59th consecutive year that our dividend has increased we have paid a dividend for 125 years every year since our incorporation in 1890 

longterm and shortterm debt   we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital total debt was 304 billion as of june 30 2015 and 354 billion as of june 30 2014 our total debt decreased in 2015 mainly due to debt maturities partially offset by debt issuances 

treasury purchases   total share repurchases were 46 billion in 2015 and 60 billion in 2014 

liquidity 

at june 30 2015 our current liabilities exceeded current assets by 144 million 25 billion excluding current assets and current liabilities of the batteries business held for sale largely due to shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs as of june 30 2015 110 billion of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities is held offshore by foreign subsidiaries amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the us we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our 

 

overall liquidity financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future we utilize short and longterm debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchases we have strong short and longterm debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets in addition we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that if needed should provide sufficient credit funding to meet shortterm financing requirements 

on june 30 2015 our shortterm credit ratings were p1 moodys and a1 standard  poors while our longterm credit ratings are aa3 moodys and aa standard  poors all with a stable outlook 

we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an 110 billion facility split between a 70 billion fiveyear facility and a 40 billion 364day facility which expire in august 2018 and july 2016 respectively the 364day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future these credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers nor do they have material adverse events clauses except at the time of signing in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities for additional details on debt see note 4

contractual commitments 

the following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of june 30 2015  



 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include income taxes certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company 

the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of 

 

certain deferred tax balances primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards and our ability to uphold certain tax positions 

realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods which involves business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the 

the procter  gamble company 38 

progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate for additional details on the companys income taxes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

employee benefits 

we sponsor various postemployment benefits throughout the world these include pension plans both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and other postemployment benefit opeb plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations as permitted by us gaap the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary opeb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for 2015 the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and opeb assets was 72 and 83 respectively a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and opeb assets would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 101 million 

since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses discount rates used for our us defined benefit pension and opeb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan for our international plans the discount rates are 

 

set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans of 31 and 45 respectively represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a 100basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual aftertax defined benefit pension expense by approximately 195 million a change in the opeb discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual aftertax opeb expense by approximately 60 million for additional details on our defined benefit pension and opeb plans see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets 

significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 

we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles economic barriers to entry a brands relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands other acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors all of our acquired technology and customerrelated intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives 

the costs of determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets we 

39     the procter  gamble company 

test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

with the exception of our appliances and batteries businesses all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed recorded values however future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in addition any potential change in the strategic plans for these businesses due to the refocusing of our business portfolio could impact these judgments assumptions and estimates in turn impacting our fair value a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year the recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge 

prior to 2013 our appliances reporting unit incurred an impairment charge to reduce the goodwill carrying amount to its estimated fair value during 2013 the estimated fair value of our appliances reporting unit declined further below the carrying amount resulting from the prior impairment therefore we recorded an additional noncash before and aftertax impairment charge of 259 million  in fiscal 2013 additionally our 2013 impairment testing for appliances indicated a decline in the fair value of our braun trade name intangible asset below its carrying value this resulted in a noncash beforetax impairment charge of 49 million   31 million  aftertax to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value the impairment of the appliances business in fiscal 2013 was due to the devaluation of currency in japan a key country that generates a significant portion of the earnings of the appliances business relative to the currencies in which the underlying net assets are recorded 

as of june 30 2015 the appliances business has remaining goodwill of 299 million  and remaining intangible assets of 706 million  as a result of the impairments the estimated fair value of our appliances business slightly exceeds its 

 

respective carrying value our 2015 valuation of the appliances business has it returning to sales and earnings growth rates consistent with our longterm business plans however the currency in japan has continued to devalue relative to the currencies in which the related assets are recorded reducing the fair value cushion in the appliances business to approximately 5  

during 2015 we determined that the estimated fair value of our batteries reporting unit was less than its carrying amount resulting in a series of impairment charges the underlying fair value assessment was initially triggered by an agreement in september 2014 to sell the chinabased battery joint venture and a related decision to pursue options to exit the remainder of the batteries business the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing during fiscal 2014 had indicated a decline in the fair value of the batteries reporting unit due to lower longterm market growth assumptions in certain key geographies at that time the estimated fair value of the batteries business continued to exceed its underlying carrying value but the fair value cushion had been reduced to about 5  the agreement to sell the chinabased battery joint venture was at a transaction value that was below the earnings multiple implied from the prior valuation of our batteries business which effectively eliminated our fair value cushion as a result the remaining business unit cash flows no longer supported the remaining carrying amount of the batteries business due largely to these factors we recorded an initial noncash before and aftertax impairment charge of 863 million  to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill for the batteries business unit to its estimated fair value these same factors resulted in a decline in the fair value of our duracell trade name intangible asset below its carrying value this resulted in a noncash beforetax impairment charge of 110 million   69 million  after tax to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value 

in november 2014 the company reached an agreement to divest the remaining batteries business via a split transaction in which the company will exchange a recapitalized duracell company for berkshire hathaways bh shares of pg stock see note 13 based on the terms of the agreement and the value of bhs shares of pg stock at the agreement date and changes thereto through june 30 2015 the company recorded additional noncash before and aftertax impairment charges totaling 12  billion all of the fiscal 2015 impairment charges in the batteries business are included as part of discontinued operations 

the business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions overall category growth rates competitive activities cost containment and margin expansion and company business plans we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable changes to or a failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses in addition we also 

the procter  gamble company 40 

considered the structure and value of the divestiture agreement with bh in the impairment testing for batteries if the value of bh’s shares of the company declines further before the transaction closing dates we may need to record additional noncash impairment charges as part of discontinued operations in the future

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

as a multinational company with diverse product offerings we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices we evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting except within financing operations we leverage the companys diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments to the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities these financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument types and other hedging practices note 5 to the consolidated financial statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments 

derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk modeling the tests for interest rate currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the corporatemanager™ valueatrisk model using a oneyear horizon and a 95 confidence level the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposures move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics™ dataset as of june 30 2015  in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetrics™ a reasonable proxy is included 

our market risk exposures relative to interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as discussed below have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period in addition we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term 

 

interest rate exposure on financial instruments   interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the companys foreign net investments 

based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june 30 2015  including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates we believe a nearterm change in interest rates at a 95 confidence level based on historical interest rate movements would not materially affect our financial statements 

currency rate exposure on financial instruments   because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months in addition we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions 

based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june 30 2015  we believe at a 95 confidence level based on historical currency rate movements the impact of a nearterm change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements 

commodity price exposure on financial instruments   we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors we may use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 

as of and during the years ended june 30 2015  and june 30 2014  we did not have any commodity hedging activity 

measures not defined by us gaap 

our discussion of financial results includes several nongaap financial measures we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management when used in the mda we have provided the comparable us gaap measure in the discussion these measures include 

organic sales growth   organic sales growth is a nongaap measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions divestitures and foreign exchange from yearoveryear comparisons we believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation

the following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth 



 core eps   this is a measure of the companys diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the companys sustainable results or trends this includes 

 we do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results we believe the core eps measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of yearonyear earnings per share growth core eps is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation 

 

the table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to core eps 

note  all reconciling items are presented net of tax tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction 

adjusted free cash flow   adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding certain divestiture impacts tax payments in the current year for the pet care divestiture we view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investments adjusted free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation the following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow  millions 



adjusted free cash flow productivity   adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges on the batteries business and the venezuelan deconsolidation charge adjusted free cash flow productivity is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation

financial information about segments 

as of june 30 2014 the company has five reportable segments under us gaap beauty grooming health care fabric care and home care and baby feminine and family care many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate while none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal components within certain reportable segments such as batteries fabric care and home care appliances grooming and prestige fragrances beauty are seasonal in addition anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters such as hurricanes can drive unusually high demand for batteries 

additional information about our reportable segments can be found in mda and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements

key product categories  information on key product categories can be found in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

key customers  our customers include mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores salons distributors ecommerce and highfrequency stores sales to walmart stores inc and its affiliates represent approximately 14 of our total revenue in 2014 2013 and 2012 no other customer represents more than 10 of our net sales our top ten customers account for approximately 30 of our total unit volume in 2014 and 2013 and 31 of our total unit volume in 2012 the nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government we believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete 

sources and availability of materials  almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the company are purchased from others some of which are singlesource suppliers we produce certain raw materials primarily chemicals for further use in the manufacturing process in addition fuel natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in the distribution of input materials and finished 

12       the procter  gamble company 

product to customers the prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation when prices for these items change we may or may not pass the change to our customers the company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials none of which is material to our business taken as a whole

competitive condition  the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies including wellknown global competitors in many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers privatelabel brands we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate often holding a leadership or significant market share position we support our products with advertising promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with an extensive sales force we believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products product quality performance value and packaging are also important differentiating factors

 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the 

the procter  gamble company       13 

time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

a change in consumer demand for our products andor lack of market growth could have a significant impact on our business   

we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by focusing on the most profitable businesses biggest innovations and most important emerging markets we also expect to achieve our financial targets in part by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions if demand for our products andor market growth rates in either developed or developing markets falls substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses our volume and consequently our results could be negatively impacted this could occur due to among other things unforeseen negative economic or political events unexpected changes in consumer trends and habits or negative consumer responses to pricing actions 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels 

the consumer products industry is highly competitive across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result there are ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins this includes among other things increasing competition from mid and lowertier value products in both developed and developing markets to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives and trade terms in addition the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics failure to 

 

effectively compete in these new channels could negatively impact results 

our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product marketing and operations innovation and our ability to successfully respond to competitive innovation  

achieving our business results depends in part on the successful development introduction and marketing of new products and improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances made by competitors and intellectual property rights granted to competitors failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our results 

our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials labor costs energy costs pension and healthcare costs and foreign exchange and interest rates therefore our success is dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost saving projects and sourcing decisions while maintaining and improving margins and market share in addition our financial projections include cost savings described in our announced productivity plan failure to deliver these savings could adversely impact our results 

we face risks that are inherent in global manufacturing that could negatively impact our business results 

we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements to achieve our cost targets while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials it may be impracticable to have a sufficient alternative source particularly when the input materials are in limited supply in addition our strategy for global growth includes increased presence in emerging markets some emerging markets have greater political volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets any significant disruption of manufacturing such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business 

14       the procter  gamble company 

we rely on third parties in many aspect our business which creates additional risk 

due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties for certain functions such as our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners or external business partners while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our financial legal reputational andor operational risk 

we face risks associated with having significant international operations 

we are a global company with manufacturing operations in more than 40 countries and a significant portion of our revenue outside the us our international operations are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to 

 we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange import authorization or pricing controls including but not limited to venezuela argentina china india and egypt our results of operations andor financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment 

fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the us are translated into us dollars our operations outside of the us generate a significant portion of our net revenue fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore adversely impact our business results or financial condition see also the results of operations and cash flow financial condition and liquidity sections of the 

 

mda and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

we face risks related to changes in the global and political economic environment including the global capital and credit markets 

our business is impacted by global economic conditions which continue to be volatile our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world if the global economy experiences significant disruptions our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to a slowdown in the general economy supplier vendor or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets andor temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers vendors and suppliers 

our objective is to maintain credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global capital and credit markets any downgrade of our current credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us 

we could also be negatively impacted by political issues or crises in individual countries or regions including sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments for example we could be adversely impacted by instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the us 

consequently our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global andor economic uncertainty especially in our significant geographies as well as any political or economic disruption these risks could negatively impact our overall liquidity and financing costs as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments including refunds of value added taxes andor create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the companys reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies such as customers and suppliers in addition many of our brands have worldwide recognition this recognition is the result of the large investments we have made in our products over many years the quality and safety of our products is critical to our business our company also devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability if we are unable to effectively 

the procter  gamble company       15 

manage real or perceived issues including concerns about safety quality efficacy or similar matters sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands and the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination negative or inaccurate postings or comments about the company could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands in addition given the association of our individual products with the company an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products or the company as a whole thereby potentially hurting results 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change could impact our business results 

our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth our financial results could be adversely impacted we continue to execute a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies we expect these types of changes which may include many staffing adjustments as well as employee departures to continue for the foreseeable future successfully managing these changes including retention of particularly key employees is critical to our business success we are generally a buildfromwithin company and our success is dependent on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities could impact our business results 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against our business objectives specifically our financial results could be adversely impacted if 1 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired 

 

assets to fall below book value 2 we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with divested brands or 3 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions and joint ventures which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets 

our business is subject to changes in legislation regulation and enforcement and our ability to manage and resolve pending legal matters in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements and increased enforcement actions and penalties may alter the environment in which we do business the increasingly complex and rapidly changing legal and regulatory environment creates additional challenges for our ethics and compliance programs our ability to continue to meet these challenges could have an impact on our legal reputational and business risk 

 as a usbased multinational company we are subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these or other tax regulations should change our financial results could be impacted for example there are increasing calls in the us from members of leadership in both major us political parties for “comprehensive tax reform” which may significantly change the income tax rules that are applicable to us domiciled corporations such as pg it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential legislation would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flows but such changes could significantly impact our financial results 

our ability to manage regulatory environmental tax including but not limited to any audits or other investigations and legal matters including but not limited to product liability patent and other intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position furthermore if pending legal matters including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we sell most of our products via retail customers which consist of mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores salons distributors ecommerce and highfrequency stores our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers this includes 

16       the procter  gamble company 

our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption 

consolidation among our retail customers could also create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complexity across broader geographic boundaries for both us and our key retailers this would be particularly challenging if major customers are addressing local trade pressures local law and regulation changes or financial distress 

a breach of information security including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information technology it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

 numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of our it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data the company has made investments seeking to address these threats including monitoring of networks and systems 

 

employee training and security policies for the company and its thirdparty providers however because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures if the it systems networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or if we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action the costs and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant

ability to achieve business plans  we are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers our continued success is dependent on innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands this means we must be able to obtain and maintain patents and trademarks and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition our success is also dependent on effective sales advertising and marketing programs in a more fastpaced and rapidly changing environment our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing net sales and volume profitably especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets including developing markets in which we have chosen to focus there are high levels of competitive activity in the markets in which we operate to address these challenges we must respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives trade terms and product initiatives we must manage each of these factors as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition divestiture and joint venture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against base business objectives 

daily conduct of our business also depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems including systems operated by thirdparty suppliers and to maintain security over our data 

26       the procter  gamble company 

cost pressures  our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials labor costs foreign exchange and interest rates therefore our success is dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions as well as ongoing productivity improvements we also must manage our debt and currency exposure especially in certain countries with currency exchange controls such as venezuela china india egypt and argentina we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including sole supplier and manufacturing plant arrangements and successfully manage any disruptions at company manufacturing sites we must implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plans including our established outsourcing relationships and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization successfully managing these changes including identifying developing and retaining key employees is critical to our success 

global economic conditions  demand for our products has a correlation to global macroeconomic factors the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic economic changes terrorist activity political unrest and natural disasters may result in business interruption inflation deflation or decreased demand for our products our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political andor economic uncertainty especially in our significant geographic markets due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters we could also be negatively impacted by a global regional or national economic crisis including sovereign risk in the event of a deterioration in the credit worthiness of or a default by local governments resulting in a disruption of credit markets such events could negatively impact our ability to collect receipts due from governments including refunds of value added taxes create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions andor negatively impact our overall liquidity additionally changes in exchange controls and other limits could impact our ability to repatriate earnings from overseas 

regulatory environment  changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards and tax laws or the enforcement thereof our ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including but not limited to product liability patent and other intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results 

results of operations 

the key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales gross margin selling general and administrative expenses sga other nonoperating items and income taxes the 

 

primary factors driving yearoveryear changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete product initiatives the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as pricing actions which can also indirectly impact volume changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the us 

most of our cost of products sold and sga are to some extent variable in nature accordingly our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute yearoveryear changes in total costs the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs energy and other commodities pricing impacts geographic mix for example gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products product mix for example the beauty segment has higher gross margins than the company average foreign exchange rate fluctuations in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature the primary drivers of sga are marketingrelated costs and overhead costs marketingrelated costs are primarily variable in nature although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies overhead costs are also variable in nature but on a relative basis less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth accordingly we generally experience more scalerelated impacts for these costs 

the company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain research and development marketing and overhead expenses the plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work processes to fund the companys growth strategy the company expects to incur in excess of 45 billion  in beforetax restructuring costs over a fiveyear period fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016 as part of this plan overall the costs and other nonmanufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver in excess of  28 billion  in annual gross beforetax savings see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

net sales 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

net sales increased 1 to 831 billion in 2014 on a 3 increase in unit volume versus the prior year period fabric care and home care along with baby feminine and family care volume grew midsingle digits grooming and health care volume grew low single digits beauty volume was unchanged volume increased low single digits in developed regions and grew midsingle digits in developing regions 

the procter  gamble company       27 

unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2 organic sales grew 3 driven by the unit volume increase a 1 favorable impact from higher pricing was offset by a 1 impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix due to higher relative growth of developing regions which have lower than average selling prices and of lower priced product categories such as fabric care and baby care 

fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 

net sales increased 1 to 826 billion in 2013 on a 2 increase in unit volume volume in health care and baby feminine and family care grew midsingle digits volume in fabric care and home care grew low single digits 

 

beauty volume was in line with the prior year grooming volume decreased low single digits volume grew low single digits in both developed and developing regions the impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories price increases added 1 to net sales driven by price increases across all business segments primarily executed in prior periods to offset cost increases and devaluing developing market currencies foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2 organic sales growth was 3 driven by both volume and price increases 

operating costs 



fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

gross margin contracted 100 basis points to 489 of net sales in 2014 the decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a 150 basis point impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix a 50 basis point impact from higher commodity costs and a 90 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange partially offset by manufacturing cost savings of 190 basis points and a 40 basis point benefit from higher pricing the unfavorable geographic and product mix was caused by disproportionate growth in developing regions and the fabric care and home care and baby feminine and family care segments which have lower gross margins than the company average 

total selling general and administrative expenses decreased 5 to 253 billion in 2014 due to a reduction in marketing spending overhead expense and restructuring costs sga as a percentage of net sales decreased 170 basis points to 305 lower restructuring spending drove 30 basis points of the decline marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points primarily due to lower spending behind a focus on more efficient marketing support and scale benefits from increased net sales overhead spending decreased 50 basis points from productivity savings of 40 basis points and scale benefits from increased net sales the 2014 impact from foreign currency policy changes in venezuela was comparable to the prior year devaluation impact

gross margin expanded 40 basis points in 2013 to 499 of net sales driven by higher pricing and manufacturing cost savings partially offset by negative mix and higher commodity costs gross margin was positively impacted by 70 basis points from higher pricing and approximately 160 basis points from manufacturing cost savings gross margin was negatively impacted by 160 basis points from negative geographic and product mix behind disproportionate growth in developing regions and midtier products both of which have lower gross margins than the company average gross margin was also reduced by capacity investments and to a lesser extent by foreign exchange impacts and higher commodity costs 

total sga increased 2 to 266 billion in 2013 driven by a charge for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in venezuela and an increase in marketing spending partially offset by reduced overhead costs as a result of the productivity and cost savings plan sga as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points to 322 largely due to a 40 basis point impact from the venezuela devaluation charge and a 10 basis point increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 20 basis points as a 70 basis point benefit from our productivity and cost savings plan and 20 basis points of lower restructuring costs were largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange this was due to a higher

the effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 170 basis points to 214 in 2014 the primary driver of this rate decline was approximately 320 basis points from the favorable geographic mix of earnings and approximately 60 basis points due to the nondeductibility of the prior year impairment charges related to our appliances business these impacts were partially offset by a 50 basis point increase due to the venezuela currency policy changes and devaluation discussed below which decreased the prior year rate 20 basis points and increased the current year rate by 30 basis points a 110 basis point increase due to the tax impacts of acquisition and divestiture activities the gains from the purchase of the balance of the baby care and feminine care joint venture in iberia and the sale of our italy bleach business in the prior year and a 30 basis point increase is due to the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions the net benefit on the current year was 228 million or 150 basis points versus 180 basis points of net benefit in the prior year

venezuela currency impacts 

venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under us gaap as a result the us dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in venezuela any currency remeasurement adjustments for nondollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings for the current fiscal year venezuela represented approximately 1 of the company’s consolidated net sales and operating profit excluding the impact of the remeasurement charge discussed below 

through december 31 2013 the venezuelan government had established one official exchange rate for qualifying dividends and imported goods and services transactions at the official exchange rate are subject to approval by cencoex national center for external commerce previously cadivi foreign exchange administrative commission effective february 9 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivares fuerte vef per dollar the remeasurement of our local balance sheets to reflect this devaluation in the fiscal year ended 2013 resulted in an after tax charge of 236 million 008 per share 

in addition to the preferential cencoex exchange rate there are and have been parallel exchange markets controlled by the central bank of venezuela as the only legal intermediary to execute foreign exchange transactions outside of cencoex through december 31 2013 various regulations and a limited notional amount of transactions that ran through these programs essentially eliminated the companys ability to access any foreign exchange rate other than the preferential rate to pay for imported goods andor manage our local monetary asset balances accordingly all of our net monetary assets were measured at the preferential 63 vef per dollar exchange rate through december 31 2013 in addition through december 31 2013 our results in venezuela were reflected in our consolidated financial statements at the official cadivi rate which was the rate we expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations 

on january 24 2014 the government made a number of announcements affecting currency exchange rate and other controls the preferential cencoex exchange rate remains at 63 vef per dollar in addition while there is considerable uncertainty as to the nature of transactions that will flow through cencoex and how cencoex will operate in the future the company believes that a significant portion of its imports will continue to qualify for the preferential rate however the importation of certain finished goods and raw materials for some product categories along with the payment of dividends and

royalties will be executed under the sicad complementary system for foreign exchange administration program sicad is an auctionbased exchange program the company expects to be able to access the sicad program for dividends and other transactions the rate available through sicad was 117 vef per dollar in january 2014 and was 106 vef per dollar at june 30 2014 the company incurred an after tax charge of 275 million 009 per share in january 2014 to remeasure certain portions of our local venezuela balance sheets not qualifying for the preferential cencoex rate to the initial sicad exchange rate in late march 2014 the government introduced a third exchange mechanism referred to as sicad ii which is also an auctionbased program currently trading at approximately 500 vef per dollar the company does not expect to access sicad ii accordingly the underlying sicad ii exchange rates have not been utilized for purposes of remeasuring or translating our venezuela results 

as of june 30 2014 the company had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of approximately 10 billion approximately 670 million of that amount is expected to be utilized to satisfy liabilities for past imports that were approved under cencoex and are measured at the preferential 63 vef per dollar rate the remaining balance has been measured at the sicad rate local currency net monetary balances increased approximately 110 million versus june 30 2013 as increases due to earnings in venezuela the timing of cencoex payments and an increase in the net amount of indirect value added taxes vat receivable from the government from goods receipts and shipments was partially offset by the remeasurement of balances from the preferential cencoex rate to the sicad rate 

other controls imposed by the venezuelan government include import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls price controls and recently enacted profit margin controls the ongoing impact of the recent announcements and our ability to restore net sales and profit to levels achieved prior to the recent devaluations will be impacted by several factors these include our ability to mitigate the effect of the price and profit margin controls any potential future devaluation of the preferential cencoex exchange rate any significant change in the   auction exchange rates or liquidity in the sicad program any migration of additional product categories from the 

 

cencoex to the sicad rates any company actions to access the sicad ii market any further venezuelan government price or exchange controls economic conditions and the availability of raw materials and utilities in addition depending on the future availability of us dollars at the preferential rate our local us dollar needs our overall repatriation plans including our ability to obtain government approval for the payment of dividends which has been limited in recent years the creditworthiness of the local depository institutions and other creditors and our ability to collect amounts due from customers and the government including vat receivables we may have exposure for our local monetary assets

restructuring accruals of 381 million as of june 30 2014 are classified as current liabilities approximately 75 of the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2014 either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuringtype activities the resulting charges are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting 

refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for more details on the restructuring program 

cash flow financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses brands and geographies as necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating cash flow 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

operating cash flow was 140 billion in 2014 a 6 decrease from the prior year which was primarily driven by a 1 billion discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation deferred income taxes and gains on sale and purchase of businesses partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities working capital changes did not have a significant impact on operating cash flow in 2014 reduced accounts receivable generated 87 million of cash primarily due to improved collection results which along with the timing and mix of sales late in the period drove a 1 day decrease in accounts receivable days sales outstanding inventory changes did not significantly impact operating cash flow as inventory management improvement efforts offset inventory needed to support product initiatives and build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes inventory days on hand decreased by 3 days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts accounts payable accrued and other liabilities also did not significantly impact operating cash flow other operating assets and liabilities utilized 16 billion of cash primarily driven by 1 billion of cash used for a discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan 

36       the procter  gamble company 

fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 

operating cash flow was 149 billion in 2013 a 12 increase from the prior year operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation asset impairments deferred income taxes and gains on sale and purchase of businesses and a decrease in working capital increased accounts receivable used 415 million of cash primarily to fund growth in addition accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased two days due to the timing and mix of sales late in the period and foreign exchange impacts increased inventory used 225 million of cash to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes partially offset by inventory management improvement efforts inventory days on hand increased by one day primarily due to foreign exchange impacts increased accounts payable accrued and other liabilities generated 13 billion of cash primarily due to an increase in marketing accruals from increased advertising and other marketing costs 

free cash flow   we view free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investment it is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their atrisk compensation 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

free cash flow was 101 billion in 2014 a decrease of 7 versus the prior year the decrease was driven by the decrease in operating cash flows which was primarily due to a 1 billion discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings was 86 in 2014 

fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 

free cash flow was 109 billion in 2013 an increase of 17 versus the prior year the increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings was 95 in 2013 

investing cash flows 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

net investing activities consumed 41 billion in cash in 2014 mainly due to capital spending and cash paid for investments in availableforsale securities partially offset by asset sales 

fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 

net investing activities consumed 63 billion in cash in 2013 mainly due to capital spending cash paid for acquisitions and investments in availableforsale securities partially offset by asset sales 

 

capital spending   we manage capital spending to support our business growth plans and have cost controls to deliver our cash generation targets capital expenditures primarily to support capacity expansion innovation and cost savings were 38 billion in 2014 and 40 billion in 2013 capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 46 in 2014 capital spending as a percentage of net sales in 2013 increased 10 basis points to 49 

acquisitions  acquisition activity was not material in 2014 acquisitions used 11 billion of cash in 2013 primarily for the acquisition of our partners interest in a joint venture in iberia 

proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales   proceeds from asset sales contributed 570 million in cash in 2014 mainly due to minor brand divestiture activities including mdvip the pert business in latin america and the bleach business in ceemea and latin america proceeds from asset sales contributed 584 million in cash in 2013 mainly due to the divestitures of the bleach business in italy and the braun household appliances business 

financing cash flows 

dividend payments   our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments dividends per common share increased 7 to 245 per share in 2014 total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were 69 billion in 2014 and 65 billion in 2013 in april 2014 the board of directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from 06015 to 06436 per share on common stock and series a and b esop convertible class a preferred stock this represents a 7 increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 58th consecutive year that our dividend has increased we have paid a dividend in every year since our incorporation in 1890 

longterm and shortterm debt   we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital total debt was 354 billion as of june 30 2014 and 315 billion as of june 30 2013 our total debt increased in 2014 mainly due to debt issuances and an increase in commercial paper outstanding partially offset by bond maturities 

treasury purchases   total share repurchases were 60 billion in 2014 and 2013 

liquidity 

at june 30 2014 our current liabilities exceeded current assets by 21 billion 43 billion excluding current assets and current liabilities of the pet care business held for sale largely due to shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations the company regularly assesses 

the procter  gamble company       37 

its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs the majority of our cash is held offshore by foreign subsidiaries but we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the united states to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future we utilize short and longterm debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchases we have strong short and longterm debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets in addition we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that if needed should provide sufficient credit funding to meet shortterm financing requirements 

on june 30 2014 our shortterm credit ratings were p1 moodys and a1 standard  poors while our longterm credit ratings are aa3 moodys and aa standard  poors all with a stable outlook 

we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an 110 billion facility split between a 70 billion 5year facility and a 40 billion 364day facility which expire in august 2018 and july 2015 respectively the 364day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in and in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future these credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers nor do they have material adverse events clauses except at the time of signing in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity

contractual commitments 

the following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of june 30 2014 



 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include income taxes certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company 

the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated 

 

differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement or net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized to reduce future taxes deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

the procter  gamble company       39 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate for additional details on the companys income taxes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

employee benefits 

we sponsor various postemployment benefits throughout the world these include pension plans both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and other postemployment benefit opeb plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations as permitted by us gaap the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion of the deferred amount is included in 

 

expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary opeb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for 2014 the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and opeb assets was 72 and 83 respectively a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and opeb assets would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 111 million 

since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses discount rates used for our us defined benefit pension and opeb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan for our international plans the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans of 35 and 44 respectively represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a 100basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual aftertax defined benefit pension expense by approximately 197 million a change in the opeb discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual aftertax opeb expense by approximately 79 million for additional details on our defined benefit pension and opeb plans see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets 

significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 

we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles economic barriers to entry a brands relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows 

40       the procter  gamble company 

unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands other acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors all of our acquired technology and customerrelated intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives 

the costs of determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

with the exception of our appliances batteries and salon professional businesses all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed recorded values however future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in addition any potential change in the strategic plans for these businesses due to the refocusing of our business portfolio could impact these judgments assumptions and estimates in turn impacting our fair value a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges 

 

that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year the recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge 

the results of our impairment testing during fiscal 2012 indicated that the estimated fair values of our appliances and salon professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts therefore we recorded a noncash before and aftertax impairment charge of 13 billion in fiscal 2012 additionally our impairment testing for indefinitelived intangible assets during fiscal 2012 indicated a decline in the fair value of our koleston perfect and wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values this resulted in a noncash beforetax impairment charge of 246 million 173 million aftertax to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their estimated fair values 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the estimated fair value of our appliances reporting units declined further below the carrying amount resulting from the fiscal 2012 impairment therefore we recorded an additional noncash before and aftertax impairment charge of 259 million in fiscal 2013 additionally our fourth quarter 2013 impairment testing for appliances indicated a decline in the fair value of our braun trade name intangible asset below its carrying value this resulted in a noncash beforetax impairment charge of 49 million 31 million aftertax to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value 

the appliances business was acquired as part of the gillette acquisition in 2005 and the salon professional business consists primarily of operations acquired in the wella acquisition in 2004 both businesses are standalone reporting units these businesses represent some of our more discretionary consumer spending categories because of this their operations and underlying fair values were disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn that began in fiscal 2009 which led to a reduction in home and personal grooming appliance purchases and in visits to hair salons that drove the fiscal 2012 impairment the additional impairment of the appliances business in fiscal 2013 was due to the devaluation of currency in japan a key country that generates a significant portion of the earnings of the appliances business relative to the currencies in which the underlying net assets are recorded as of june 30 2014 the appliances business has remaining goodwill of 317 million and remaining intangible assets of 875 million while the salon professional business has remaining goodwill of 436 million and remaining intangible assets of 726 million as a result of the impairments the estimated fair value of our appliances business and the salon professional business slightly exceed their respective carrying values our fiscal 2014 valuations of the appliances and salon professional businesses has them returning to sales and earnings growth 

the procter  gamble company       41 

rates consistent with our longterm business plans changes to or a failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses 

the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing during fiscal 2014 indicated a decline in the fair value of the batteries reporting unit due to lower longterm market growth assumptions in certain key geographies the estimated fair value of batteries continues to exceed its underlying carrying value but the fair value cushion has been reduced to about 5 as of june 30 2014 the batteries business has goodwill of 26 billion and intangible assets of 24 billion the actual batteries business results for the year ended june 30 2014 were in line with the 2014 projections used in our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing 

the business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions overall category growth rates competitive activities cost containment and margin expansion and company business plans we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable however actual events and results of the batteries reporting unit could differ substantially from those used in our valuations to the extent such factors result in a further reduction of the level of projected cash flows used to estimate the batteries reporting unit fair value we may need to record noncash impairment charges in the future 

in addition in the fourth quarter of the year ended june 30 2014 a key competitor announced its intent to split its consolidated business into two separate companies during 2015 one of those companies would operate primarily in the batteries category while this proposed transaction has not been consummated initial independent third party estimates of the competitor’s standalone batteries business valuation are well below the earnings multiple implied from the valuation of our batteries business we attribute the implied valuation differences to our more favorable business trends primarily organic net sales and share growth along with scale dissynergies general market uncertainty regarding the capabilities and competitiveness of a standalone company and lack of a control premium in addition the company conducts a regular portfolio review of its businesses to assess longterm strategic fit if our portfolio review process were to result in a decision to divest the batteries business a divestiture could result in a loss that could be material if potential acquirers utilize valuations consistent with those indicated above for the key competitor

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

as a multinational company with diverse product offerings we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices we evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting except within financing operations we leverage the companys broadly diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments to the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities these financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument types and other hedging practices note 5 to the consolidated financial statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments 

derivative positions can be monitored using techniques including market valuation sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk modeling the tests for interest rate currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the corporatemanager™ valueatrisk model using a oneyear horizon and a 95 confidence level the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposures move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics™ dataset as of june 30 2014 in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetrics™ a reasonable proxy is included 

our market risk exposures relative to interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as discussed below have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period in addition we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term 

interest rate exposure on financial instruments   interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on 

42       the procter  gamble company 

our investments in foreign operations these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the companys foreign net investments 

based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june 30 2014 including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates we believe a nearterm change in interest rates at a 95 confidence level based on historical interest rate movements would not materially affect our financial statements 

currency rate exposure on financial instruments  because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with our financing operations we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months in addition we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions 

based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june 30 2014 we believe at a 95 confidence level based on historical currency rate movements the impact of a nearterm change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements 

commodity price exposure on financial instruments   we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors we may use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 

as of and during the years ended june 30 2014 and june 30 2013 we did not have any commodity hedging activity 

measures not defined by us gaap 

our discussion of financial results includes several nongaap financial measures we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management when used in mda we have provided the comparable gaap measure in the discussion these measures include 

organic sales growth   organic sales growth is a nongaap measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions divestitures and foreign exchange from yearoveryear comparisons we believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation 

 

the following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth 

  

 acquisitiondivestiture impact includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales 

core eps   this is a measure of the companys diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the companys sustainable results or trends this includes charges in 2014 2013 and 2012 for incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings charges in 2014 and 2013 for the balance sheet impacts from foreign exchange policy changes and the devaluations of the official foreign currency exchange rate in venezuela charges in 2014 2013 and 2012 related to pending european legal matters a holding gain in 2013 on the purchase of the balance of our iberian joint venture jv and impairment charges in 2013 and 2012 for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets  we do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results we believe the core eps measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of yearonyear earnings per share growth core eps is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation

financial information about segments 

as of june 30 2013 the company has five reportable segments under us gaap beauty grooming health care fabric care and home care and baby care and family care many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate while none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal components within certain reportable segments such as batteries fabric care and home care appliances grooming and prestige fragrances beauty are seasonal in addition anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters such as hurricanes can drive unusually high demand for batteries

narrative description of business 

business model  our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products as well as the creation of new products the markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive our products are sold in more than 180  countries and territories around the world primarily through mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores salons ecommerce and highfrequency stores the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets we work collaboratively with our customers to improve the instore presence of our products and win the first moment of truth  when a consumer is shopping in the store we must also win the second moment of truth  when a consumer uses the product evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and decides whether it was a good value we believe we must continue to provide new innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business research and product development activities designed to enable sustained organic growth continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year while many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years we believe these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth 

key product categories  information on key product categories can be found in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

key customers  our customers include mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores highfrequency stores distributors and ecommerce retailers sales to walmart stores inc and its affiliates represent approximately 14 of our total revenue in 2013 and 2012 and 15 in 2011 no other customer represents more than 10 of our net sales our top ten customers account for approximately 30 31 and 32 of our total unit volume in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government we believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete 

sources and availability of materials  almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the company are purchased from others some of which are singlesource suppliers we produce certain raw materials primarily chemicals for further use in the manufacturing process in addition fuel natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in the distribution of input materials and finished product to customers the prices we pay for materials and 

14       the procter  gamble company 

other commodities are subject to fluctuation when prices for these items change we may or may not pass the change to our customers the company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials none of which is material to our business taken as a whole 

trademarks and patents  we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products the trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products all major products and trademarks in each business are registered in part our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks patents and licenses 

competitive condition  the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies including wellknown global competitors in many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers privatelabel brands we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate often holding a leadership or significant market share position we support our products with advertising promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force we believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products product quality performance value and packaging are also important competitive factors 

research and development expenditures  research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers total research and development expenses were 20 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011   

expenditures for environmental compliance  expenditures for compliance with federal state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the company no material change is expected in fiscal year 2014

financial information about foreign and domestic operations 

net sales in the united states account for approximately 36 of total net sales no other individual country exceeds 10 of total net sales operations outside the united states are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may be affected by additional factors including changing currency values different rates of inflation economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and disruptions our sales by geography for the fiscal years ended june 30 were as follows 



 net sales and assets in the united states and internationally were as follows in billions 






 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k other quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the 

the procter  gamble company       15      

time the statements are made which may become out of date or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

a change in consumer demand for our products andor lack of market growth could have a significant impact on our business   

we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by focusing on the most profitable businesses biggest innovations and most important emerging markets we also expect to achieve our financial targets in part by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions if demand for our products andor market growth rates in either developed or developing markets falls substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses our volume and consequently our results could be negatively impacted this could occur due to among other things unforeseen negative economic or political events changes in consumer trends and habits or negative consumer responses to pricing actions 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels 

the consumer products industry is highly competitive across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result there are ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins this includes among other things increasing competition from mid and lowertier value products in both developed and developing markets to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives and trade terms in addition the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics failure to 

 

effectively compete in these new channels could negatively impact results 

our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product marketing and operations innovation and our ability to successfully respond to competitive innovation  

achieving our business results depends in part on the successful development introduction and marketing of new products and improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances made by competitors and intellectual property rights granted to competitors failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our results 

our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials labor costs energy costs pension and healthcare costs and foreign exchange and interest rates therefore our success is dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost saving projects and sourcing decisions while maintaining and improving margins and market share in addition our financial projections include cost savings described in our announced productivity plan failure to deliver these savings could adversely impact our results 

we face risks that are inherent in global manufacturing that could negatively impact our business results 

we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements to achieve our cost targets while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials it may be impracticable to have a sufficient alternative source particularly when the input materials are in limited supply in addition our strategy for global growth includes increased presence in emerging markets some emerging markets have greater political volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets any significant disruption of manufacturing such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business 

16       the procter  gamble company 

we face risks associated with having significant international operations 

we are a global company with manufacturing operations in more than 40 countries and a significant portion of our revenue is outside the us our international operations are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to 

 we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange import authorization or pricing controls including but not limited to venezuela argentina china india and egypt our results of operations andor financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment 

fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the united states are translated into us dollars our operations outside of the us generate a significant portion of our net revenue fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore adversely impact our business results or financial condition see also the results of operations and cash flow financial condition and liquidity sections of the mda and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

we face risks related to changes in the global and political economic environment including the global capital and credit markets 

our business is impacted by global economic conditions which continue to be volatile our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world if the global economy experiences significant disruptions our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to a slowdown in the general 

 

economy supplier vendor or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets andor temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers vendors and suppliers 

our objective is to maintain credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global capital and credit markets any downgrade of our current credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us 

we could also be negatively impacted by political issues or crises in individual countries or regions including sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments for example we could be adversely impacted by continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states 

consequently our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global andor economic uncertainty especially in our significant geographies as well as any political or economic disruption these risks could negatively impact our overall liquidity and financing costs as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments including refunds of value added taxes andor create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the companys reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies such as customers and suppliers in addition many of our brands have worldwide recognition this recognition is the result of the large investments we have made in our products over many years the quality and safety of our products is critical to our business our company also devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about safety quality efficacy or similar matters these issues could negatively impact sentiments toward the company or our products our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands and the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit 

the procter  gamble company       17      

products in addition given the association of our individual products with the company an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products or the company as a whole thereby potentially hurting results 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change could impact our business results 

we recently experienced a ceo transition as well as other senior leadership changes and we continue to execute a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies we expect these types of changes which may include many staffing adjustments as well as employee departures to continue for the foreseeable future successfully managing these changes including retention of particularly key employees is critical to our business success further ongoing business and organizational changes are likely to result in more reliance on third parties for various services and that reliance may increase reputational operational and compliance risks including the risk of corruption we are generally a buildfromwithin company and our success is dependent on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business this includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense finally our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth our financial results could be adversely impacted 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities could impact our business results 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against our business objectives specifically our financial results could be adversely impacted if 1 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value 2 we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with divested brands or 3 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions and joint ventures which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets additionally joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks associated with each joint venture 

 

our business is subject to changes in legislation regulation and enforcement and our ability to manage and resolve pending legal matters in the united states and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements and increased enforcement actions and penalties may alter the environment in which we do business as a us based multinational company we are subject to tax regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the united states is not taxed in the united states provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states if these or other tax regulations should change our financial results could be impacted 

in addition our ability to manage regulatory environmental tax and legal matters including but not limited to product liability patent and other intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position furthermore if pending legal matters including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

there are increasing calls in the united states from members of leadership in both major us political parties for “comprehensive tax reform” which may significantly change the income tax rules that are applicable to us domiciled corporations such as pg it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential legislation would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flows but such changes could significantly impact our financial results 

a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we sell most of our products via retail customers which consist of mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores highfrequency stores distributors and ecommerce retailers our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption 

consolidation among our retail customers could also create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complexity across broader geographic boundaries for both us 

18       the procter  gamble company 

and our key retailers this would be particularly challenging if major customers are addressing local trade pressures local law and regulation changes or financial distress 

a failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information technology it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

 increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of our it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data if the it systems networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions 

 

in our ability to manage operations and reputational competitive andor business harm which may adversely impact our results of operations andor financial condition

trade customers our continued success is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations on the continued positive reputations of our brands and our ability to successfully maintain trademark protection this means we must be able to obtain patents and trademarks and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition our success is also dependent on effective sales advertising and marketing programs our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing net sales and volume profitably especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets including developing markets in which we have chosen to focus there are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate to address these challenges we must respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives trade terms and product initiatives we must manage each of these factors as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition divestiture and joint venture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against base business objectives 

daily conduct of our business also depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems including systems operated by thirdparty suppliers and to maintain security over our data 

cost pressures  our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials labor costs foreign exchange and interest rates therefore our success is dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions as well as consistent productivity improvements we also must manage our debt and currency exposure especially in certain countries with currency exchange controls such as venezuela china india egypt and argentina we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including sole supplier and manufacturing plant arrangements and successfully manage any disruptions at company manufacturing sites we must implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plans including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization successfully managing these changes including identifying developing and retaining key employees is critical to our success 

global economic conditions  demand for our products has a correlation to global macroeconomic factors the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic economic changes terrorist activity political unrest and natural disasters may result in business interruption inflation 

 

deflation or decreased demand for our products our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political andor economic uncertainty especially in our significant geographic markets due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters we could also be negatively impacted by a global regional or national economic crisis including sovereign risk in the event of a deterioration in the credit worthiness of or a default by local governments resulting in a disruption of credit markets such events could negatively impact our ability to collect receipts due from governments including refunds of value added taxes create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions andor negatively impact our overall liquidity additionally changes in exchange controls and other limits could impact our ability to repatriate earnings from overseas 

regulatory environment  changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards and tax laws or the enforcement thereof our ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including but not limited to product liability patent and other intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results 

results of operations 

the key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales gross margin selling general and administrative expenses sga other nonoperating items and income taxes the primary factors driving yearoveryear changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete product initiatives geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as pricing actions which can also indirectly impact volume changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the us 

most of our cost of products sold and sga are to some extent variable in nature accordingly our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute yearoveryear changes in total costs the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs energy and other commodities pricing impacts product and geographic mix for example gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature the primary drivers of sga are marketingrelated costs and overhead costs marketingrelated costs are primarily variable in nature although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies overhead costs are also variable in nature but on a relative basis less so than marketing costs due to our

ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth accordingly we generally experience more scalerelated impacts for these costs 

in february and november 2012 the company made announcements related to a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain research and development marketing and overhead expenses the plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the companys growth strategy the company expects to incur in excess of 35 billion  in beforetax restructuring costs over a fiveyear period fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016 as part of this plan overall the costs are expected to deliver in excess of 20 billion in beforetax annual savings

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

net sales increased 3 to 837 billion in 2012 on unit volume that was consistent with the prior year period difficult macroeconomic conditions caused a slowdown in market growth in fiscal 2012 particularly in developed markets in addition we initiated a number of price increases across each reportable segment in fiscal 2012 in large part to recover the rising cost of commodities and currency devaluations these factors negatively impacted volume growth in 2012 but the price increases led to higher overall sales volume grew low single digits in beauty grooming health care and baby care and family care fabric care and home care volume decreased low single digits volume grew midsingle digits in developing regions and was down low single digits in developed regions the impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories price increases added 4 to net sales driven by price increases across all business segments and regions primarily to help offset commodity costs and devaluing currencies in certain developing markets mix reduced net sales by 1 due to unfavorable geographic mix across the beauty grooming health care and fabric care and home care reportable segments and unfavorable product mix foreign exchange was neutral to net sales organic sales growth was 3 driven by price increases 

operating costs 



fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 

gross margin expanded 30 basis points in 2013 to 496 of net sales driven by higher pricing and manufacturing cost savings partially offset by negative mix and higher commodity costs gross margin was positively impacted by 70 basis points from higher pricing and approximately 160 basis points from manufacturing cost savings gross margin was negatively impacted by 160 basis points from negative geographic and product mix behind disproportionate growth 

 

in developing regions and midtier products both of which have lower gross margins than the company average gross margin was also reduced by capacity investments and to a lesser extent by foreign exchange impacts and higher commodity costs

offset by reduced overhead costs as a result of the productivity and cost savings plan sga as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points to 320 largely due to a 40 basis point impact from the venezuela devaluation charge and a 10 basis point increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 20 basis points as a 70basis point benefit from our productivity and cost savings plan and 20 basis points of lower restructuring costs were largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange this was due to a higher portion of sga spending in strengthening currencies as compared to net sales higher employee wages and benefit costs and increased merchandising investments

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

gross margin contracted 160 basis points in 2012 to 493 of net sales the reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 230basis point impact from higher commodity and energy costs gross margin was also negatively impacted by 200 basis points from negative geographic and product mix and by 30 basis points from the impact of increased restructuring spending due to the productivity and cost savings plan the negative mix resulted from disproportionate growth in developing regions as developing regions have lower relative gross margins than developed regions these impacts were partially offset by a 200basis point impact from increased pricing and a 140basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings 

total sga increased 3 to 264 billion in 2012 driven by higher marketing spending to support initiative activity and a 510 million increase in restructuring spending from our productivity and cost savings plan partially offset by a reduction in competition law fines see item 3 of this form 10k and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements which were 303 million in 2011 compared to 75 million in 2012 sga as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 315 as reduced competition law fines and the impact of increased scale leverage on marketing and overhead costs from higher sales were partially offset by 60 basis points of incremental restructuring costs

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

in 2012 the effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 510 basis points to 271 primarily due to a 250basis point impact from the nondeductibility of impairment charges in fiscal 2012 and the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions which drove 250 basis points of the tax rate difference the net benefit from favorable discrete adjustments was 165 million in fiscal 2012 which netted to 130 basis points versus 380 basis points of net benefits in fiscal 2011

diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 19 in 2012 to 312 due to the decline in net earnings partially offset by a reduction in shares outstanding the reduction in the number of shares outstanding was driven by treasury share repurchases of 40 billion which were made under our publicly announced share repurchase program partially offset by shares issued under sharebased compensation plans diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations increased 046 due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business partially offset by a decrease in the earnings of the snacks business prior to the divestiture diluted net earnings per share decreased 7 from the prior year to 366 in fiscal 2012 core eps in 2012 decreased 1 to 385 

venezuela currency impacts 

venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under us gaap as a result the us dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in venezuela any currency remeasurement adjustments for nondollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings 

the venezuelan government has established one official exchange rate for qualifying dividends and imported goods and services that rate was equal to 43 bolivares fuertes vef to one us dollar through february 12 2013 effective february 13 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency relative to the us dollar from 43 to 63 official rate the remeasurement of our balance sheets in 2013 to reflect the impact of the devaluation resulted in a net aftertax charge of 236 million 008 per share there will also be an ongoing impact related to translating our income statement at the new exchange rates moving from the 43 rate to the 63 rate will reduce future total company reported net sales by less than 1 on a going basis this does not impact our organic sales growth rate which excludes the impact of foreign currency changes versus our existing business plans the exchange rate change reduced our reported earnings per share by approximately 004 per share in 2013 

the procter  gamble company       31      

transactions at the official exchange rate are subject to cadivi venezuelan governments foreign exchange administrative commission our overall results in venezuela are reflected in our consolidated financial statements at the official rate which is currently the rate expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations 

in addition to the official exchange rate there had been a parallel exchange market sitme that was controlled by the central bank of venezuela as the only legal intermediary to execute foreign exchange transactions outside of cadivi the published rate was 53 through february 12 2013 the notional amount of transactions that ran through this foreign exchange rate for nonessential goods was restrictive which for us essentially eliminated our ability to access any foreign exchange rate other than the official cadivi rate to pay for imported goods andor manage our local monetary asset balances when the government devalued its currency in february 2013 it also eliminated sitme but established a new exchange rate market program referred to as sicad as of june 30 2013 there is little official information available on the new auction process or the underlying auction rates 

as of june 30 2013 we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of 913 million local currency balances decreased 14 since june 30 2012 due to the impact of the february 2013 devaluation and an increase in payments by the government through cadivi partially offset by an increase in the net amount of indirect value added taxes vat receivable from the government from goods receipts and shipments prior to the february 2013 devaluation a portion of our net monetary assets denominated in local currency was remeasured using the sitme rate because we planned to use that amount of the net assets largely cash to satisfy us dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars the remaining net monetary asset balances had been reflected within our consolidated financial statements at the 43 official exchange rate however as noted in the preceding paragraph the parallel sitme market was eliminated at the time of the february 2013 devaluation and there is little information available on the sicad mechanism accordingly all of our net monetary assets are measured at the official 63 exchange rate at june 30 2013 

additionally the venezuelan government enacted a price control law during the second half of fiscal 2012 that negatively impacted the net selling prices of certain products sold in venezuela 

depending on the ultimate transparency and liquidity of the sicad market it is possible that we may remeasure a 

 

portion of our net monetary balances the amount of the net assets needed to satisfy us dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars approximately 240 million as of june 30 2013 at the sicad rate this would result in an additional devaluation charge over time we intend to restore net sales and profit to levels achieved prior to the devaluation however our ability to do so will be impacted by several factors these include the companys ability to mitigate the effect of the recently enacted price controls any potential future devaluation any further venezuelan government price or exchange controls economic conditions and the availability of raw materials and utilities in addition depending on the future availability of us dollars at the official rate our local us dollar needs our overall repatriation plans the creditworthiness of the local depository institutions and other creditors and our ability to collect amounts due from customers and the government including vat receivable we may have exposure for our local monetary assets we also have devaluation exposure for the differential between the current and potential future official exchange rates

corporate 



corporate includes certain operating and nonoperating activities not allocated to specific business units these include the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level financing and investing activities other general corporate items the historical results of certain divested brands and categories certain asset impairment charges and certain restructuringtype activities to maintain a competitive cost structure including manufacturing and workforce optimization corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to us gaap the most significant reconciling items include income taxes to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall company effective tax rate adjustments for unconsolidated entities to eliminate net sales cost of products sold and sga for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for us gaap and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100 ownership since certain unconsolidated entities and less than 100owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the related segments they are accounted for similar to a whollyowned subsidiary for management and segment purposes this means our segment results recognize 100 of each income statement component through beforetax earnings in the segments with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in corporate in determining segment net earnings we apply the statutory tax rates with adjustments to arrive at the companys effective tax rate in corporate and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest 

corporate net sales primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities included in business segment results accordingly corporate net sales are generally negative negative net sales in corporate for 2013 decreased by 250 million due to 1 the purchase of the balance of our iberian joint venture after which this business is consolidated for both segment and consolidated 

 

results and the underlying sales no longer need to be eliminated and 2 smaller adjustments required to eliminate reduced sales of the remaining unconsolidated entities corporate net earnings improved 16 billion primarily due to reduced net aftertax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges which totaled 15 billion in the prior year as compared to 290 million in the current period along with the current year net aftertax holding gain related to the purchase of the balance of our iberian joint venture partially offset by the current year charge for the impact of the venezuela devaluation additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in corporate are included in the results of operations section 

in 2012 negative net sales in corporate decreased by 108 million due to adjustments required to eliminate the lower net sales of unconsolidated entities corporate net earnings declined 22 billion primarily due to the net after tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 15 billion incremental aftertax restructuring charges of 587 million and the impact of lower net discrete tax adjustments in 2012 additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in corporate are included in the results of operations section above 

productivity and cost savings plan 

in february and november 2012 the company made announcements related to a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain research and development marketing and overheads the plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work processes to fund the companys growth strategy 

 as part of this plan the company expects to incur in excess of 35 billion in beforetax restructuring costs over a fiveyear period from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016 approximately 55 of the costs have been incurred through the end of fiscal 2013 savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activities the corollary benefits achieved the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment overall the costs are expected to deliver in excess of 2 billion in beforetax annual savings the cumulative beforetax savings realized as a result of restructuring costs incurred through 2013 were approximately 940 million 

restructuring accruals of 323 million as of june 30 2013 are classified as current liabilities approximately 86 of the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2013 either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuringtype activities the resulting charges are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting

cash flow financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses brands and geographies as necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating cash flow 

fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 

operating cash flow was 149 billion in 2013 a 12 increase from the prior year operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation asset impairments deferred income taxes and gains on sale and purchase of businesses and a decrease in working capital increased accounts receivable used 415 million of cash primarily to fund growth in addition accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased two days due to the timing and mix of sales late in the period and foreign exchange impacts increased inventory used 225 million of cash to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes partially offset by inventory management improvement efforts inventory days on hand increased by one day primarily due to foreign exchange impacts increased accounts payable accrued and other liabilities generated 13 billion of cash primarily due to an increase in marketing accruals from increased advertising and other marketing costs 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

operating cash flow was 133 billion in 2012 in line with the prior year operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation asset impairments deferred income taxes and gains on sale of businesses partially offset by working capital increases increased accounts receivable used 427 million of cash to fund growth however accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down two days primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange inventory generated 77 million of cash mainly due to an increase in inventory management improvement efforts partially offset by inventory to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity 

 

expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes inventory days on hand declined by 10 days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts and the impact of foreign exchange accounts payable accrued and other liabilities used 22 million of cash due primarily to the payment of fines related to violations of the european competition laws cash flow from discontinued operations contributed approximately 200 million to operating cash flow 

free cash flow   we view free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investment it is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their atrisk compensation 

fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 

free cash flow was 109 billion in 2013 an increase of 17 versus the prior year the increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings was 95 in 2013 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

free cash flow was 93 billion in 2012 a decrease of 7 versus the prior year free cash flow decreased primarily due to higher capital spending to support geographic expansion free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings was 85 in 2012 

investing cash flows 

fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 

net investing activities consumed 63 billion in cash in 2013 mainly due to capital spending cash paid for acquisitions and investments in availableforsale securities partially offset by asset sales 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

net investing activities consumed 11 billion in cash in 2012 mainly due to capital spending partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of 29 billion these proceeds were primarily related to cash received from the sale of our snacks business in 2012 

capital spending   we manage capital spending to support our business growth plans and have cost controls to deliver our cash generation targets capital expenditures primarily to support capacity expansion innovation and cost savings were 40 billion in both 2013 and 2012 capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 48 in 2013 capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points to 47 in 2012 

acquisitions  acquisitions used 11 billion of cash in 2013 primarily for the acquisition of our partners interest in a joint venture in iberia acquisitions used 134 million of 

38       the procter  gamble company 

cash in 2012 primarily for the acquisition of new chapter a vitamins supplement business 

proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales   proceeds from asset sales contributed 584 million in cash in 2013 mainly due to the divestitures of our bleach business in italy and the braun household appliances business proceeds from asset sales contributed 29 billion to cash in 2012 mainly due to the sale of our snacks business 

financing cash flows 

dividend payments   our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments dividends per common share increased 7 to 229 per share in 2013 total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were 65 billion in 2013 and 61 billion in 2012 in april 2013 the board of directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from 05620 to 06015 per share on common stock and series a and b esop convertible class a preferred stock this represents a 7 increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 57th consecutive year that our dividend has increased we have paid a dividend in every year since our incorporation in 1890 

longterm and shortterm debt   we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital total debt was 315 billion as of june 30 2013 and 298 billion as of june 30 2012 our total debt increased in 2013 mainly due to debt issuances and an increase in commercial paper outstanding partially offset by bond maturities 

treasury purchases   total share repurchases were 60 billion in 2013 and 40 billion in 2012 

liquidity 

at june 30 2013 our current liabilities exceeded current assets by 60 billion largely due to shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations additionally a portion of our cash is held offshore by foreign subsidiaries the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the united states to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future we utilize short and longterm debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchases we have strong short and longterm debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets in addition we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that if needed should provide 

 

sufficient credit funding to meet shortterm financing requirements 

on june 30 2013 our shortterm credit ratings were p1 moodys and a1 standard  poors while our longterm credit ratings are aa3 moodys and aa standard  poors both with a stable outlook 

we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an 110 billion facility split between a 70 billion 5year facility and a 40 billion 364day facility which expire in august 2018 and august 2014 respectively the 364day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in and in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future these credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers nor do they have material adverse events clauses except at the time of signing in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity

contractual commitments 

the following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of june 30 2013 



 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include income taxes certain employee benefits and acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company 

the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred the tax effect of 

40       the procter  gamble company 

expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate for additional details on the companys income taxes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

employee benefits 

we sponsor various postemployment benefits throughout the world these include pension plans both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and other postemployment benefit opeb plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and 

 

managements best judgment regarding future expectations as permitted by us gaap the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary opeb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for 2013 the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and opeb assets were 73 and 83 respectively a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and opeb assets would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 100 million 

since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses discount rates used for our us defined benefit pension and opeb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan for our international plans the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans of 40 and 48 respectively represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a 100basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual aftertax defined benefit pension expense by approximately 160 million a change in the opeb discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual aftertax opeb expense by approximately 65 million for additional details on our defined benefit pension and opeb plans see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets 

our consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations 

the procter  gamble company       41      

and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 

we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles economic barriers to entry a brands relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands other acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors all of our acquired technology and customerrelated intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives 

the costs of determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur an impairment test is performed and 

 

indefinitelived brands may be adjusted to a determinable life 

with the exception of our appliances and salon professional businesses all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed recorded values however future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year the recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge 

for example the gillette intangible and goodwill amounts represent values as of a more recent acquisition date and as such the amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate gillette indefinitelived intangible assets represent approximately 89 of the 268 billion of indefinitelived intangible assets at june 30 2013 goodwill allocated to standalone reporting units consisting primarily of businesses purchased as part of the gillette acquisition represents 42 of the 552 billion of goodwill at june 30 2013 this includes the shave care and appliances businesses which are components of the grooming segment and the batteries business which is part of the fabric care and home care segment 

the results of our impairment testing during fiscal 2012 indicated that the estimated fair values of our appliances and salon professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts therefore we recorded a noncash before and aftertax impairment charge of 13 billion in fiscal 2012 additionally our impairment testing for indefinitelived intangible assets during fiscal 2012 indicated a decline in the fair value of our koleston perfect and wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values this resulted in a noncash beforetax impairment charge of 246 million 173 million aftertax to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their estimated fair values 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the estimated fair value of our appliances reporting units declined further below the carrying amount resulting from the fiscal 2012 impairment therefore we recorded an additional noncash before and aftertax impairment charge of 259 million in fiscal 2013 additionally our fourth quarter 2013 impairment testing for appliances indicated a decline in the fair value of our braun trade name intangible asset below its carrying value this resulted in a noncash beforetax impairment charge of 49 million 31 million aftertax to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value

the appliances business was acquired as part of the gillette acquisition in 2005 and the salon professional business consists primarily of operations acquired in the wella acquisition in 2004 both businesses are standalone reporting units these businesses represent some of our more discretionary consumer spending categories because of this their operations and underlying fair values were disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn that began in fiscal 2009 which led to a reduction in home and personal grooming appliance purchases and in visits to hair salons that drove the fiscal 2012 impairment the additional impairment of the appliances business in fiscal 2013 was due to the devaluation of currency in japan a key country that generates a significant portion of the earnings of the appliances business relative to the currencies in which the underlying net assets are recorded as of june 30 2013 the appliances business has remaining goodwill of 313 million while the salon professional business has remaining goodwill of 424 million as a result of the impairments the estimated fair value of our appliances business approximates its carrying value while the estimated fair value of the salon professional business now slightly exceeds its carrying value our fiscal 2013 valuations of the appliances and salon professional businesses has them returning to sales and earnings growth rates consistent with our longterm business plans failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses 

new accounting pronouncements 

during fiscal 2013 the company adopted asu 201105 comprehensive income topic 220  presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 and asu 201302 “comprehensive income topic 220  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income” asu 201302 this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity and requires entities to present the components of net earnings and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements we chose to present net earnings and other comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements this guidance also requires entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and to present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income we chose to present the requirements in the notes to the financial statements see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements the adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

no other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

as a multinational company with diverse product offerings we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices we evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting except within financing operations we leverage the companys broadly diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments to the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities these financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument types and other hedging practices note 5 to the consolidated financial statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments 

derivative positions can be monitored using techniques including market valuation sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk modeling the tests for interest rate currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the corporatemanager™ valueatrisk model using a oneyear horizon and a 95 confidence level the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposures move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics™ dataset as of june 30 2013 in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetrics™ a reasonable proxy is included 

our market risk exposures relative to interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as discussed below have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period in addition we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term 

interest rate exposure on financial instruments   interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the companys foreign net investments 

based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june 30 2013 including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates we believe a nearterm change in interest rates at a 95 confidence level based on 

the procter  gamble company       43      

historical interest rate movements would not materially affect our financial statements 

currency rate exposure on financial instruments  because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with our financing operations we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months in addition we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions 

based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june 30 2013 we believe at a 95 confidence level based on historical currency rate movements the impact of a nearterm change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements 

commodity price exposure on financial instruments   we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors in addition to fixed price contracts we may use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 

as of and during the year ended june 30 2013 we did not have material commodity hedging activity 

measures not defined by us gaap 

our discussion of financial results includes several nongaap financial measures we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management when used in mda we have provided the comparable gaap measure in the discussion these measures include 

organic sales growth   organic sales growth is a nongaap measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions divestitures and foreign exchange from yearoveryear comparisons we believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation 

 

the following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth 

  

 acquisitiondivestiture impact includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales 

core eps   this is a measure of the companys diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the companys sustainable results or trends this includes a charge in 2013 for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in venezuela a holding gain in 2013 on the purchase of the balance of our iberian joint venture impairment charges in 2013 and 2012 for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets charges in 2013 and 2012 related to incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings a significant benefit in 2011 from the settlement of us tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations and charges in 2013 2012 and 2011 related to pending european legal matters we do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results we believe the core eps measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of yearonyear earnings per share growth core eps is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation

the table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to core eps 



note  all reconciling items are presented net of tax tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction the significant adjustment to an income tax reserve was tax expense there was no tax impact on eps due to the charges for pending european legal matters 

free cash flow   free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending we view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investment free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation 

free cash flow productivity   free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings free cash flow productivity is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation 

the following table provides a numerical reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity  millions

financial information about segments 

as of june 30 2012 the company is organized into two global business units gbus beauty and grooming and household care we have five reportable segments under us gaap beauty grooming health care fabric care and home care and baby care and family care many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate while none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal components within certain reportable segments such as batteries fabric care and home care appliances grooming and prestige fragrances beauty are seasonal in addition anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters such as hurricanes can drive 

 

unusually high demand for batteries

narrative description of business 

business model  our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products as well as the creation of new products the markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive our products are sold in more than 180 countries around the world primarily through mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores department stores salons and in highfrequency stores the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets we work collaboratively with our customers to improve the instore presence of our products and win the first moment of truth  when a consumer is shopping in the store we must also win the second moment of truth  when a consumer uses the product evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and decides whether it was a good value we believe we must continue to provide new innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business research and product development activities designed to enable sustained organic growth continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year while many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years we believe these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth 

key product categories  information on key product categories can be found in note 11 of our consolidated financial statements segment information 

key customers  our customers include mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores and highfrequency stores sales to walmart stores inc and its affiliates represent approximately 14 15 and 16 of our total revenue in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively no other customer represents more than 10 of our net sales our top ten customers account for approximately 31 of our total unit volume in 2012 and 32 of our total unit volume in 2011 and 2010 the nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government we believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete 

sources and availability of materials  almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the company are purchased from others some of whom are singlesource suppliers we produce raw materials primarily chemicals for further use in the manufacturing process in addition fuel natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in

the distribution of input materials and finished product to customers the prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation when prices for these items change we may or may not pass the change to our customers depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the change the company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials none of which is material to our business taken as a whole 

trademarks and patents  we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products the trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products all major products and trademarks in each business are registered in part our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks patents and licenses 

competitive condition  the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies including wellknown global competitors in many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers privatelabel brands we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate often holding a leadership or significant market share position we support our products with advertising promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force we believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products product quality performance value and packaging are also important competitive factors 

research and development expenditures  research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers total research and development expenses were 20 billion in 2012 and 2011 and 19 billion in 2010 

  

expenditures for environmental compliance  expenditures for compliance with federal state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the company no material change is expected in fiscal year 2013 

employees  total number of employees is an estimate of total company employees excluding interns coops and employees of joint ventures historical numbers include employees of discontinued operations 

  

 



financial information about foreign and domestic operations

 net sales and assets in the united states and internationally were as follows in billions 






 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the 

the procter  gamble company       4      

following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

a material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

  

we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing higher margin businesses and by focusing on the most profitable businesses biggest innovations and most important emerging markets we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions if demand for our products andor market growth rates in either developed or developing markets fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses our volume and consequently our results could be negatively impacted this could occur due to among other things unforeseen negative economic or political events changes in consumer trends and habits or negative consumer responses to pricing actions 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels 

the consumer products industry is highly competitive across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result there are ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins this includes among other things increasing competition from mid and lowertier value products in both developed and developing markets to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives and trade terms in addition the emergence of new sales channels such as sales made through the internet directly to consumers may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics failure to effectively compete in these new channels could negatively impact results 

our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product and operations innovation and our ability to successfully respond to competitive innovation  

achieving our business results depends in part on the successful development introduction and marketing of new products and improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes successful innovation depends on 

 

our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances by and intellectual property rights granted to competition and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our results 

our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures which could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials labor costs energy costs pension and healthcare costs foreign exchange and interest rates therefore our success is dependent in part on our continued ability to forecast and manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects including outsourcing projects and sourcing decisions while maintaining and improving margins and market share in addition our financial projections include cost savings described in our announced productivity plan failure to deliver these savings could adversely impact our results 

there are risks inherent in global manufacturing which could negatively impact our business results 

in the manufacturing and general overhead areas we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements to achieve our targets on cost while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials significant disruption of manufacturing such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business 

we face risks associated with having significant international operations 

we are a global company with manufacturing operations in more than 40 countries and a significant portion of our revenue is outside the us our international operations are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to 



5       the procter  gamble company 

contractual rights in certain jurisdictions 

 we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls including but not limited to venezuela china and india in addition some countries where we have businesses such as argentina have introduced import restrictions our results of operations andor financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment 

fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the united states are translated into us dollars our operations outside of the us generate a significant portion of our net revenue fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore adversely impact our business results or financial condition see also the financial condition and results of operations section of the mda and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

we face risks related to changes in the global and political economic environment including the global capital and credit markets 

our business is impacted by global economic conditions which have recently been volatile our products are sold in more than 180 countries around the world if the global economy experiences significant disruptions our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to a slowdown in the general economy supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers vendors and suppliers andor liquidity issues resulting from an inability to access credit markets to obtain cash to support operations 

our objective is to maintain credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global capital and credit markets any downgrade of our current credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us 

 

we could also be negatively impacted by political crises in individual countries or regions including sovereign risk related to a deterioration in the credit worthiness or a default by local governments for example we could be adversely impacted by continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union such as greece or the negative impact on economic growth resulting from the combination of federal income tax increases and government spending restrictions potentially occurring at the end of calendar year 2012 in the united states commonly referred to as the “fiscal cliff” 

consequently our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global andor economic uncertainty especially in our significant geographical markets as well as any political or economic disruption these risks could negatively impact our overall liquidity and financing and borrowing costs as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments including refunds of value added taxes andor create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the companys reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies such as customers and suppliers in addition many of our brands have worldwide recognition this recognition is the result of the large investments we have made in our products over many years the quality and safety of our products is critical to our business our company also devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about safety quality efficacy or similar matters these issues could negatively impact sentiments toward the company or our products our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands and the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products in addition given the association of our individual products with the company an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products or the company as a whole thereby potentially hurting results 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change could impact our business results 

we have executed a number of significant business 

the procter  gamble company       6      

and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies we expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future successfully managing these changes including retention of key employees is critical to our business success further ongoing business and organizational changes are likely to result in more reliance on third parties for various services and that reliance may increase reputational operational and compliance risks including the risk of corruption we are generally a buildfromwithin company and our success is dependent on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business this includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled employees is limited and competition for these resources is intense finally our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth our financial results could be adversely impacted 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities could impact our business results 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against our business objectives specifically our financial results could be adversely impacted if 1 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions and joint ventures 2 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3 we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with divested brands additionally joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks associated with each joint venture we enter into 

our business is subject to changes in legislation regulation and enforcement and our ability to manage and resolve pending legal matters in the united states and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements and increased enforcement actions and penalties may alter the environment in which we do business as a us based multinational company we are subject to tax regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the united states is not taxed in the united states provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside 

 

the united states if these or other tax regulations should change our financial results could be impacted 

in addition our ability to manage regulatory environmental tax and legal matters including product liability patent and other intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position furthermore if pending legal matters including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in item 3 of this form 10k and note 10 of our consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

there are increasing calls in the united states from members of leadership in both major us political parties for “comprehensive tax reform” which may significantly change the income tax rules that are applicable to us domiciled corporations such as pg it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential legislation would be cumulatively positive or negative for pgs earnings and cash flows 

a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we sell most of our products via retail customers which consist of mass merchandisers grocery stores club stores drug stores and highfrequency stores our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products 

consolidation among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and our key retailers this would be particularly challenging if major customers are addressing local trade pressures local law and regulation changes or financial distress 

a failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information technology it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by 

7       the procter  gamble company 

thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

 increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of our it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data if the it systems networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational competitive andor business harm which may adversely impact our results of operations andor financial condition

the following managements discussion and analysis mda is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of pgs financial condition results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes mda is organized in the following sections 

 throughout mda we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance including unit volume growth net sales and net earnings we also refer to a number 

 

of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap including organic sales growth core earnings per share core eps free cash flow and free cash flow productivity organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestitures core eps is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain specified charges free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings we believe these measures provide investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends the explanation at the end of mda provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures 

management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information references to market share and market consumption in mda are based on a combination of vendorreported consumption and market size data as well as internal estimates all market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products relative to all product sales in the category and are measured on an annual basis versus the prior 12 month period references to competitive activity includes promotional and product initiatives from our competitors

improving productivity and creating a cost savings culture   

we have taken significant steps to accelerate cost savings and create a more costfocused culture within the company including a fiveyear 10 billion cost savings initiative which was announced in february 2012 the cost savings program is based on 

 

 

strengthening our upstream innovation program and pipeline   

innovation has always been  and continues to be  pgs lifeblood to consistently win with consumers around the world across price tiers and preferences and to consistently win versus our best competitors each pg product category must have a full portfolio of innovation the innovation portfolios must include a mix of commercial programs incremental product improvements and discontinuous innovations we have made the creation of more discontinuous innovation a top priority dedicating rd resources and funding to develop new innovations aimed at changing the game in existing product categories and creating new ones 

summary of 2012 results 





 

margin was driven primarily by higher commodity costs and negative mix partially offset by price increases and manufacturing cost savings 

 economic conditions challenges and risks 

we discuss expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in annual and quarterly reports press releases

ability to achieve business plans  we are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers our continued success is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations on the continued positive reputations of our brands and our ability to successfully maintain trademark protection this means we must be able to obtain patents and trademarks and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition our success is also dependent on effective sales advertising and marketing programs our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets including developing markets in which we have chosen to focus there are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate to address these challenges we must respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives trade terms and product initiatives we must manage each of these factors as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition divestiture and joint venture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against base business objectives 

daily conduct of our business also depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems including systems operated by thirdparty suppliers and to maintain security over our data 

cost pressures  our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials labor costs foreign exchange and interest rates therefore our success is dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions as well as consistent productivity improvements we also must manage our debt and currency exposure especially in certain countries with 

 

currency exchange controls such as venezuela china and india we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements and successfully manage any disruptions at company manufacturing sites we must implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plans including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization successfully managing these changes including identifying developing and retaining key employees is critical to our success 

global economic conditions  demand for our products has a correlation to global macroeconomic factors the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic economic changes terrorist activity political unrest and natural disasters may result in business interruption inflation deflation or decreased demand for our products our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political andor economic uncertainty especially in our significant geographic markets due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters we could also be negatively impacted by a global regional or national economic crisis including sovereign risk in the event of a deterioration in the credit worthiness of or a default by local governments resulting in a disruption of credit markets such events could negatively impact our ability to collect receipts due from governments including refunds of value added taxes create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions andor negatively impact our overall liquidity 

regulatory environment  changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards and tax laws our ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including product liability patent intellectual property competition law matters and tax policy and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results 

results of operations 

the key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales gross margin selling general and administrative expenses sga other nonoperating items and income taxes the primary factors driving year over year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete product initiatives and geographic expansion all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as pricing actions which can also indirectly impact volume changes in product mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the united states most of our cost of products sold and sga expenses are to some extent variable in nature accordingly our discussion of these operating costs focus primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year over year changes in total costs the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs energy and other 

17       the procter  gamble company 

commodities pricing impacts product and geographic mix for example gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature the primary drivers of sga are marketingrelated costs and overhead costs marketingrelated costs are primarily variable in nature although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies overhead costs are also variable in nature but on a relative basis less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth accordingly we generally experience more scalerelated impacts for these costs 

in february 2012 the company announced a 10 billion productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain research and development marketing and overhead expenses the plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the companys growth strategy the company expects to incur approximately 35 billion  in beforetax restructuring costs over a fouryear period as part of this plan 

net sales 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

net sales increased 3 to 837 billion in 2012 on unit volume that was consistent with the prior year period difficult macroeconomic conditions have caused a slowdown in market growth particularly in developed markets in addition we have initiated a number of price increases across each reportable segment in large part to recover the rising cost of commodities and currency devaluations these factors have negatively impacted volume growth in 2012 but the price increases have led to higher overall sales volume grew low single digits in beauty grooming health care and baby care and family care fabric care and home care volume decreased low 

 

single digits volume grew midsingle digits in developing regions and was down low single digits in developed regions the impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories price increases added 4 to net sales driven by price increases across all business segments and regions primarily to help offset commodity costs and devaluing currencies in certain developing markets mix reduced net sales by 1 due to unfavorable geographic mix across the beauty grooming health care and fabric care and home care reportable segments and unfavorable product mix foreign exchange was neutral to net sales organic sales growth was 3 driven by price increases 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

net sales increased 5 in 2011 to 811 billion on a 6 increase in unit volume volume grew behind market and share growth global market growth in categories that we compete grew 3 on a constant currency basis volume increased low single digits in developed regions and double digits in developing regions all geographic regions contributed to volume growth led by doubledigit growth in asia high singledigit growth in latin america and midsingledigit growth in ceemea and western europe all five of the business segments contributed to volume growth with high singledigit growth in the baby care and family care and fabric care and home care segments midsingledigit growth in the beauty and health care segments and a low singledigit growth in the grooming segment organic volume which excludes acquisitions and divestitures was up 5 mix reduced net sales by 2 due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and midtier products both of which have lower than company average selling prices and declines in the premiumpriced professional salon and prestige categories pricing added 1 to net sales behind price increases to offset higher commodity costs and foreign exchange foreign exchange was neutral to net sales organic sales were up 4 led by high singledigit growth in the baby care and family care segment as well as midsingledigit growth across the grooming and health care segments 

operating costs 



the procter  gamble company       18      

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

gross margin contracted 160 basis points in 2012 to 493 of net sales the reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 230basis point impact from higher commodity and energy costs gross margin was also negatively impacted by 200 basis points from negative geographic and product mix and by 30 basis points from the impact of increased restructuring spending due to the productivity and cost savings plan the negative mix resulted from disproportionate growth in developing regions as developing regions have lower relative gross margins than developed regions these impacts were partially offset by a 200basis point impact from increased pricing and a 140basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings 

total sga increased 3 to 264 billion in 2012 driven by higher marketing spending to support initiative activity and a 510 million increase in restructuring spending from our productivity and cost savings plan partially offset by a reduction in competition law fines see item 3 of this form 10k and note 10 of our consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies which were 303 million in the prior year compared to 75 million in the current year sga as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 315 as reduced competition law fines and the impact of increased scale leverage on marketing and overhead costs from higher sales were partially offset by 60 basis points of incremental restructuring costs 

we incurred impairment charges of 16 billion 15 billion after tax in 2012 related to the carrying values of goodwill in our appliances and salon professional businesses and our koleston perfect and wella indefinite lived intangible assets which are part of our salon professional business see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for more details including factors leading to the impairment charges since goodwill is included in corporate for internal management and segment reporting the goodwill impairment charges are included in the corporate segment the indefinite lived intangible asset impairments are also included in the corporate segment for management and segment reporting 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

gross margin contracted 140 basis points in 2011 to 509 of net sales the reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 225basis point increase in commodity and energy costs along with negative product mix from disproportionate growth in developing regions and midtier products these impacts were partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and the favorable impact of volume scale leverage 

total sga increased 4 to 258 billion in 2011 behind higher marketing and overhead spending which was partially offset by the impact of lower foreign currency exchange costs sga as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 318 due to a reduction in overhead and other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales partially offset by increased marketing investments 

 

marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points due to additional marketing investments to support innovation and expansion plans overhead spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points due to sales leverage partially offset by added spending to support growth other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points mainly due to a decrease in venezuelarelated foreign currency exchange costs of 548 million see further discussion below in venezuela currency impacts charges for competition law fines increased to 303 million versus the prior year charge of 283 million 

nonoperating items 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

interest expense decreased 7 in 2012 to 769 million due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt and a decrease in average debt outstanding other nonoperating income net primarily includes divestiture gains interest and investment income other nonoperating income decreased 71 million to 262 million in 2012 mainly behind the impact of minor brand divestitures a divestiture gain from the sale of our pur water filtration brand in the current year was less than the zest and infasil divestiture gains in the prior year 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

in 2011 interest expense decreased 12 to 831 million due primarily to a reduction in interest rates on floating rate debt partially offset by an increase in debt outstanding other nonoperating income was a net benefit of 333 million in 2011 versus 82 million in 2010 this 251 million increase was primarily due to the impact of gains on divestitures in 2011 zest brand in north america and infasil brand in western europe and incremental costs in the 2010 associated with exercising the call option on an outstanding bond partially offset by a gain due to the acquisition of mdvip in 2010 

income taxes 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

the effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 510 basis points to 271 in 2012 primarily due to a 250basis point impact from the nondeductibility of impairment charges in the current year period and the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions which drove 250 basis points of the tax rate difference the net benefit on the current year was 165 million which netted to 130 basis points versus 380 basis points of net benefits in the prior year 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

in 2011 the effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 500 basis points to 220 this was primarily driven by net favorable discrete adjustments primarily driven by favorable audit and litigation settlements for uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions relating to 

19       the procter  gamble company 

prior periods which drove 410 basis points of the effective tax rate difference net adjustments to tax balances for uncertain tax positions in a number of jurisdictions resulted in a benefit of approximately 535 million in 2011 including a 252 million benefit from the settlement of us tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations the 2011 tax rate also benefited from the geographic mix of current year sales and earnings which drove a 50basis point reduction as an increased proportion of earnings were generated in foreign markets with lower tax rates versus the united states 

net earnings 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011

venezuela currency impacts 

venezuela was determined to be a highly inflationary economy under us gaap during fiscal 2010 and as a result the us dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in venezuela currency remeasurement adjustments for nondollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings during fiscal 2010 the venezuelan government devalued the bolivar fuerte relative to the us dollar the remeasurement of our local balance sheets in fiscal 2010 to the new official exchange rate 43 bolivares fuertes to the us dollar did not materially impact our results this was due to the relatively small nondollar denominated net monetary asset position in venezuela our overall results in venezuela are reflected in our consolidated financial statements at the 43 rate which is also expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations 

foreign currency transactions in venezuela are subject to an official government currency exchange rate transactions at the official exchange rate are subject to cadivi venezuela governments foreign exchange administrative commission during recent years in addition to the official exchange rate used for qualifying dividends and imports of goods and services the venezuelan government has had a number of currency controls for companies operating in 

the procter  gamble company       20      

venezuela through most of fiscal 2010 payments for certain imported goods and services that did not qualify for the official exchange rate had been satisfied by exchanging bolivares fuertes for us dollars through securities transactions in the parallel market rather than at the more favorable official exchange rate in fiscal 2010 the venezuelan government enacted regulations that reduced the availability of foreign currency at the official exchange rate that and an increased spread between the official and parallel exchange rates during most of fiscal 2010 resulted in increased costs for exchange transactions executed using securities transactions in the parallel market during fiscal 2010 the parallel market is now controlled by the central bank of venezuela as the only legal intermediary to execute foreign exchange transactions outside of cadivi this is done through the sitme rate which was approximately 53 as of june 30 2012 the notional amount of transactions that run through this foreign exchange rate for nonessential goods is restrictive which has essentially eliminated our ability to access any foreign exchange rate other than through the official cadivi rate to pay for imported goods andor manage our local monetary asset balances finally the venezuelan government enacted a price control law during the second half of fiscal 2012 that negatively impacted the net selling prices of certain products sold in venezuela this impact was not significant for the fiscal year 

as of june 30 2012 we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of approximately 11 billion approximately 338 million of this balance has been remeasured using the sitme parallel rate because we plan to use this amount of the net monetary assets largely cash to satisfy us dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars however as noted in the preceding paragraph the availability of the parallel market to settle these transactions is uncertain the remaining net monetary asset balances are currently reflected within our consolidated financial statements at the 43 official exchange rate depending on the future availability of us dollars at the official rate our local us dollar needs our overall repatriation plans and the creditworthiness of the 

 

local depository institutions and other creditors we have exposure for our local monetary assets we also have devaluation exposure for the differential between the current and potential future official and parallel exchange rates 

our ability to effectively manage sales and profit levels in venezuela will be impacted by several factors these include the companys ability to mitigate the effect of the recently enacted price controls any potential future devaluation any further venezuelan government price or exchange controls economic conditions and availability of raw materials and utilities

corporate 

corporate includes certain operating and nonoperating activities not allocated to specific business units these include the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level financing and investing activities other general corporate items the historical results of certain divested brands and categories certain asset impairment charges and certain restructuringtype activities to maintain a competitive cost structure including manufacturing and workforce optimization corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to us gaap the most significant reconciling items include income taxes to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall company effective tax rate adjustments for unconsolidated entities to eliminate net sales cost of products sold and sga for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for us gaap and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100 ownership since certain unconsolidated entities and less than 100owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the related segments they are accounted for similar to a whollyowned subsidiary for management and segment purposes this means our segment results recognize 100 of each income statement component through beforetax earnings in the segments with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in corporate in determining segment net earnings we apply the statutory tax rates with adjustments to arrive at the companys effective tax rate in corporate and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest 

corporate net sales primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities included in business segment results accordingly corporate net sales are generally negative negative net sales in corporate decreased by 108 million due to adjustments required to eliminate the lower net sales of unconsolidated entities net corporate expenses increased 22 billion primarily due to the net after tax goodwill and intangibles impairment charges of 15 billion incremental aftertax restructuring charges of 587 million and the impact of lower net discrete tax adjustments in the current year additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in corporate are included in the results of operations section

productivity and cost savings plan 

in february 2012 the company announced a 10 billion productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain research and development marketing and overheads the program was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work processes to fund the companys growth strategy 

as part of this plan the company expects to incur approximately 35 billion in beforetax restructuring costs over a fouryear period from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2015 more than half of the costs will be incurred by the end of fiscal 2013 and the remainder in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activities the corollary benefits achieved the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment overall the costs are expected to deliver approximately 2 billion in beforetax annual savings the beforetax savings in the current year are not material due to the timing of the plan 

restructuring accruals of 343 million as of june 30 2012 are classified as current liabilities approximately 62 of the restructuring charges incurred during 2012 either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuringtype activities the resulting charges will be funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting

cash flow financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends other discretionary uses include acquisitions and share repurchases to complement our portfolio of businesses brands and geographies as necessary we may supplement 

 

operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating cash flow 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

operating cash flow was 133 billion in 2012 in line with the prior year operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization stock based compensation asset impairments deferred income taxes and gains on sale of businesses partially offset by working capital increases increased accounts receivable used 427 million of cash to fund growth however accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down 2 days primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange inventory generated 77 million of cash mainly due to an increase in inventory management improvement efforts partially offset by inventory to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes inventory days on hand declined by 10 days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts and the impact of foreign exchange accounts payable accrued and other liabilities used 22 million of cash due primarily to the payment of fines related to violations of the european competition laws cash flow from discontinued operations contributed approximately 200 million to operating cash flow

capital was a net source of cash 

free cash flow  we view free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends and other discretionary investment it is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their atrisk compensation 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

free cash flow was 93 billion in 2012 a decrease of 7 versus the prior year free cash flow decreased primarily due to higher capital spending to support geographic expansion free cash flow productivity defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings was 85 in 2012 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

in 2011 free cash flow was 100 billion a decrease of 23 versus the prior year free cash flow decreased due to lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending free cash flow productivity was 84 in 2011

acquisitions  acquisitions used 134 million of cash in 2012 primarily for the acquisition of new chapter a vitamins supplement business in 2011 acquisitions used 474 million of cash primarily for the acquisition of ambi pur an air freshener business 

 

proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales  proceeds from asset sales contributed 29 billion to cash in 2012 mainly due to the sale of our snacks business in 2011 proceeds from asset sales contributed 225 million to cash mainly due to the sale of our infasil brand in western europe and zest brand in north america 

financing cash flows 

dividend payments  our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments dividends per common share increased 8 to 214 per share in 2012 total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were 61 billion in 2012 and 58 billion in 2011 the increase in dividend payments resulted from increases in our quarterly dividends per share partially offset by a reduction in the number of shares outstanding in april 2012 the board of directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from 0525 to 0562 per share on common stock and series a and b esop convertible class a preferred stock this represents a 7 increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 56th consecutive year that our dividend has increased we have paid a dividend in every year since our incorporation in 1890 

longterm and shortterm debt  we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital total debt was 298 billion as of june 30 2012 and 320 billion as of june 30 2011 our total debt decreased in 2012 mainly due to bonds reaching maturity and a reduction in commercial paper outstanding partially offset by debt issuances

at june 30 2012 our current liabilities exceeded current assets by 30 billion largely due to shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations we utilize short and longterm debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchases we have strong short and longterm debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets in addition we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that if needed should provide sufficient credit funding to meet shortterm financing requirements 

on june 30 2012 our shortterm credit ratings were p1 moodys and a1 standard  poors while our longterm credit ratings are aa3 moodys and aa standard  poors both with a stable outlook

we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program these facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in and in accordance with the terms of each credit agreement the current facility is an 110 billion facility split between a 70 billion 5year facility and a 40 billion 364day facility which expire in august 2017 and august 2013 respectively these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future these credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers nor do they have material adverse events clauses except at 

 

the time of signing in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity

significant accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include income taxes certain employee benefits and acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company 

the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the 

 

applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate for additional details on the companys income taxes see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

employee benefits 

we sponsor various postemployment benefits throughout the world these include pension plans both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and other postemployment benefit opeb plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees for accounting purposes the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations including the following variables discount rate expected salary increases certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations as permitted by us gaap the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary opeb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for 2012 the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and opeb assets were 74 and 92 respectively a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and opeb assets would impact annual aftertax benefit expense by approximately 90 million 

since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a 

29       the procter  gamble company 

discounted basis the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses discount rates used for our us defined benefit pension and opeb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan for our international plans the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans of 42 and 43 respectively represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a 100basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual aftertax defined benefit pension expense by approximately 160 million a change in the opeb discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual aftertax opeb expense by approximately 70 million for additional details on our defined benefit pension and opeb plans see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting under the purchase method our consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 

we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles economic barriers to entry a brands relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands other acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies are 

 

expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors all of our acquired technology and customerrelated intangibles are expected to have determinable useful lives 

  

the costs of determinablelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reportable unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur indefinitelived intangible assets may be reclassified to a determinable life asset and an additional impairment assessment may be performed 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from july 1 to october 1 of each year this change was made to better align the timing of our annual impairment testing with the timing of the companys annual strategic planning process we tested goodwill for impairment as of july 1 2011 the testing date under our previous policy and no impairments were indicated the results of our impairment testing during the quarter ended december 31 2011 indicated that the estimated fair values of our appliances and salon professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amount therefore we recorded a noncash before and after tax impairment charge of 13 billion additionally our impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets during the quarter ended december 31 2011 indicated a decline in the fair value of our koleston perfect and wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values this resulted in a noncash before tax impairment charge of 246 million 173 million 

the procter  gamble company       30      

after tax to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their respective fair values 

the appliances business was acquired as part of the gillette acquisition and is a standalone goodwill reporting unit the salon professional business consists primarily of operations acquired in the wella acquisition in 2004 these businesses represent some of our more discretionary consumer spending categories as of june 30 2012 the appliances business has remaining goodwill of 586 million while the salon professional business has remaining goodwill of 397 million as a result of the current year impairments the estimated fair values of our appliances and salon professional businesses approximate their carrying values because purchases in these categories are more discretionary in nature their operations and underlying fair values were disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn that began in fiscal 2009 which led to a reduction in home and personal grooming appliance purchases and in visits to hair salons our valuation of the appliances and salon professional businesses has them returning to sales and earnings growth rates consistent with our longterm business plans failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses for additional details on the timing and results of our goodwill impairment testing see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

other than as discussed in the preceding paragraphs our annual impairment testing for both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets indicated that all other reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset fair values significantly exceeded their respective recorded values however future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in additional impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year the recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge 

for example the gillette intangible and goodwill amounts represent values as of a relatively more recent acquisition date and as such the amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate gillette indefinitelived intangible assets represent approximately 90 of the 267 billion of indefinitelived intangible assets at june 30 2012 goodwill allocated to standalone reporting units consisting primarily of businesses purchased as part of the gillette acquisition represents 43 of the 538 billion of 

 

goodwill at june 30 2012 this includes the shave care and appliance businesses which are components of the grooming segment and the batteries business which is part of the fabric care and home care segment 

new accounting pronouncements 

there are no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective that will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements however we will be presenting comprehensive income in a new format beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 in accordance with new accounting guidance that will eliminate the option of presenting components of other comprehensive earnings as part of the statement of shareholders equity for additional details see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

other information 

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

as a multinational company with diverse product offerings we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices we evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting except within financing operations we leverage the companys broadly diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments to the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities these financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument types and other hedging practices note 5 to the consolidated financial statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments 

  

derivative positions can be monitored using techniques including market valuation sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk modeling the tests for interest rate currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the corporatemanager™ valueatrisk model using a oneyear horizon and a 95 confidence level the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposures move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics™ dataset as of june 30 2012 in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetrics™ a reasonable proxy is included 

our market risk exposures relative to interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as discussed below have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period in addition we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that 

31       the procter  gamble company 

would significantly impact such exposures in the near term 

interest rate exposure on financial instruments  interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the companys foreign net investments 

based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june 30 2012 including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates we believe a nearterm change in interest rates at a 95 confidence level based on historical interest rate movements would not materially affect our financial statements 

currency rate exposure on financial instruments  because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with our financing operations we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months in addition we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions 

based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june 30 2012 we believe at a 95 confidence level based on historical currency rate movements the impact of a nearterm change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements 

commodity price exposure on financial instruments  we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors in addition to fixed price contracts we may use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 

as of and during the year ended june 30 2012 we did not have material commodity hedging activity 

measures not defined by us gaap 

our discussion of financial results includes several nongaap financial measures we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management when used in mda we have provided the comparable gaap measure in the discussion these measures include 

 

organic sales growth  organic sales growth is a nongaap measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions divestitures and foreign exchange from yearoveryear comparisons we believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation 

the following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth 

  



  acquisitiondivestiture impact includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales 

core eps  this is a measure of the companys diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the companys sustainable results or trends this includes current year impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets current year charges related to incremental restructuring charges due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings a significant benefit in 2011 from the settlement of us tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations charges in 2012 2011 and 2010 related to pending european legal matters and a 2010 charge related to a tax provision for retiree healthcare subsidy payments in the us healthcare reform legislation 

the procter  gamble company       32      

we do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results we believe the core eps measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of yearonyear earnings per share growth core eps is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation the table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to core eps 

  



note  all reconciling items are presented net of tax tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction the significant adjustment to an income tax reserve was tax expense there was no tax impact on eps due to the charges for pending european legal matters 

free cash flow  free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending we view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation 

free cash flow productivity  free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings free cash flow productivity is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their atrisk compensation 

the following table provides a numerical reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity  millions

business model  our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products as well as the creation of new products the markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price referred to as superpremium premium midtier value and lowtier economy products generally speaking we compete with superpremium premium and midtier value products our products are sold in more than 180 countries around the world primarily through mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores and in highfrequency stores the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets we work collaboratively with our customers to improve the instore presence of our products and win the first moment of truthwhen a consumer is shopping in the store we must also win the second moment of truthwhen a consumer uses the product evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and whether it was a good value we believe we must continue to provide new innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business research and product development activities designed to enable sustained organic growth continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year while many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years we believe these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth 

key product categories  in 2011 two product categories accounted for 10 or more of consolidated net sales the laundry category constituted approximately 16 of net sales for fiscal year 2011 and 17 in 2010 and 2009 the diaper category constituted approximately 11 of net sales for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 

  

key customers  our customers include mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores and highfrequency stores sales to walmart stores inc and its affiliates represent approximately 15 of our total revenue in 2011 and 16 of total revenue in 2010 and 2009 no other customer represents more than 10 of our net sales our top ten customers account for approximately 32 of our total unit volume in 2011 and 2010 compared to 30 of total unit volume in in 2009 the nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government we believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete 

sources and availability of materials  almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the company are purchased from others some of whom are singlesource suppliers we produce raw materials primarily chemicals for further use in the manufacturing process in addition fuel natural gas and derivative products are important commodities used in our plants products and in the trucks used to deliver our products to customers the prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation when prices for these items change we may or may not pass on the change to our customers depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the change the company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials no one of which is material to our business taken as a whole 

trademarks and patents  we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products the trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products all major products and trademarks in each business are registered in part our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks patents and licenses 

competitive condition  the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies including wellknown global competitors in many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers privatelabel brands we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operateoften holding a leadership or significant market share position we market our products with advertising promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force we believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products product quality performance value and packaging are also important competitive factors 

research and development expenditures  research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers total research and development expenses were 2001 million in 2011 1950 million in 2010 and 1864 million in 2009

 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k the annual report to shareholders quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become out of date or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

a material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing higher margin businesses if demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses our results could be negatively impacted this could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits in addition our continued success is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors 

across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives and trade terms as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition 

our businesses face cost pressures and risks inherent in global manufacturing which could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials labor costs foreign exchange and interest rates therefore our success is dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects including outsourcing projects sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions in the manufacturing and general overhead areas we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements in addition we are subject to risks inherent in global manufacturing such as environmental events labor disputes disruption in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials significant disruption of manufacturing could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business 

we face risks associated with significant international operations 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the united states as a result we are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may reduce the us dollar value of revenues and earnings received andor balances held by or invested in our foreign subsidiaries as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the us that can increase our exposure we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls including but not limited to venezuela china and india our results of operations andor financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks in an increasingly volatile environment further we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions our results could be negatively impacted in addition economic changes terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption inflation deflation or decreased demand for our products our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political andor economic uncertainty especially in our significant geographical markets as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the companys reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues which could negatively impact sentiments toward the company our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands particularly our billiondollar brands the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers or we are unable to maintain trademark protection further our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products 

our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business results 

we have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies we expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future successfully managing these changes including retention of key employees is critical to our business success in addition we are generally a buildfromwithin company and our success is dependent on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business this includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled employees is limited and competition for these resources is intense further business and organizational changes may result in more reliance on third parties for various services and that reliance may increase reputational operational and compliance risks including the risk of corruption finally our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth our financial results could be adversely impacted 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against base business objectives specifically our financial results could be adversely impacted if 1 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions 2 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3 we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue streams associated with divested brands 

our business is subject to legislation regulation and enforcement in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations and increased enforcement actions may alter the environment in which we do business this includes changes in competition productrelated privacy and environmental laws including actions in response to global climate change concerns increased enforcement as well as changes in accounting standards taxation requirements and enforcement penalties accordingly our ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including product liability patent and other intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position furthermore the competition law and antitrust investigations described in part i item 3 of this form 10k may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position in addition as a us based multinational company we are also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these or other tax regulations should change our financial results could be impacted 

a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles further retail trade consolidation could create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers this can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes in addition our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products 

we face risks related to changes in the global economic environment 

our business is impacted by global economic conditions which are increasingly volatile if the global economy experiences significant disruptions our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to a slowdown in the general economy supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers vendors and suppliers andor liquidity issues resulting from an inability to access credit markets to obtain cash to support operations we could also be negatively impacted by an economic crisis in individual countries or regions including sovereign risk related to a deterioration in the credit worthiness of or a default by local governments such events could negatively impact our overall liquidity as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments including refunds of value added taxes andor create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions 

a failure of a key information technology system process or site could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers in order to conduct business these systems include but are not limited to ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements providing data security and other processes necessary to manage the business if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our results of operations andor financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

the company is subject from time to time to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters including antitrust and trade regulation product liability advertising contracts environmental issues patent and trademark matters labor and employment matters and tax 

as previously reported the company has been subject to a number of investigations into potential competition law violations in europe those that remain include investigations by national authorities in belgium france germany greece and romania we believe that all of these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies andor retail customers although nonmonetary sanctions are not being sought in any of these matters competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and if violations are found can result in substantial fines 

the companys policy is to comply with all laws and regulations including all antitrust and competition laws and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities which the company is doing in response to the actions of the european commission and national authorities the company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws the company identified violations in certain european countries and appropriate actions were taken 

as a result of certain investigations that were previously disclosed several authorities issued separate complaints alleging that the company along with several other companies engaged in violations of competition laws in the past during this fiscal year the company received final decisions from the czech republic the european commission italy spain and switzerland and the united kingdom decided not to pursue a case against the company the ultimate resolution of the remaining matters listed above may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts reserved that could materially impact our income statement and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued and paid respectively please refer to the companys risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k for additional information 

in december 2008 the company became aware of an investigation by italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the companys european affiliates the accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another italian authorities have commenced a formal criminal proceeding regarding whether the companys local affiliate and certain of its employees complied with italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products should they find that these entities violated the law the italian authorities could levy fines in excess of 100 thousand against the companys european affiliates

markets we work collaboratively with our customers to improve the instore presence of our products and win the “first moment of truth”—when a consumer is shopping in the store we must also win the “second moment of truth”—when a consumer uses the product evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and whether it was a good value we believe we must continue to provide new innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business research and product development activities designed to enable sustained organic growth continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year while many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years we believe these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth 

key product categories  in 2010 two product categories accounted for 10 or more of consolidated net sales the laundry category constituted approximately 17 of net sales for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 the diaper category constituted approximately 11 of net sales for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 and 10 in 2008 

key customers  our customers include mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores and highfrequency stores sales to walmart stores inc and its affiliates represent approximately 16 of our total revenue in 2010 2009 and 2008 no other customer represents more than 10 of our net sales our top ten customers account for approximately 32 of our total unit volume in 2010 compared to 30 of total unit volume in 2009 and 31 in 2008 the nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government we believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete 

sources and availability of materials  almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the company are purchased from others some of whom are singlesource suppliers we produce raw materials primarily chemicals for further use in the manufacturing process in addition fuel natural gas and derivative products are important commodities used in our plants products and in the trucks used to deliver our products to customers the prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation when prices for these items change we may or may not pass on the change to our customers depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the change the company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials no one of which is material to our business taken as a whole 

trademarks and patents  we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products the trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products all major products and trademarks in each business are registered in part our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks patents and licenses 

competitive condition  the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies including wellknown global competitors in many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers’ privatelabel brands we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate—often holding a leadership or significant market share position we market our products with advertising promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force we believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products product quality performance value and packaging are also important competitive factors 

research and development expenditures  research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers total research and development expenses were 1950 million in 2010 1864 million in 2009 and 1946 million in 2008 

  

expenditures for environmental compliance  expenditures for compliance with federal state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the company no material change is expected in fiscal year 2011 

employees  total number of employees is an estimate of total company employees excluding interns coops and employees of joint ventures historical numbers include employees of discontinued operations 

 

 financial information about foreign and domestic operations 

net sales in the united states account for approximately 38 of total net sales no other individual country had net sales exceeding 10 of total net sales operations outside the united states are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also be affected by additional factors including changing currency values different rates of inflation economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and disruptions our sales by geography for the fiscal years ended june 30 were as follows 

 

  

 net sales and assets in the united states and internationally were as follows in billions 

 

 development of the business 

the discussion below provides insight to the general development of our business including the material acquisitions and disposition of assets since the beginning of fiscal 2010 

beauty and grooming gbu  effective july 1 2009 we implemented a number of changes to the organization structure of the beauty gbu which resulted in changes to the components of our reportable segment structure female blades and razors were formerly included in the grooming reportable segment and are now included in the beauty reportable segment certain malefocused brands and businesses such as old spice and gillette personal care moved from the beauty reportable segment to the grooming reportable segment in addition the beauty gbu was renamed the beauty and grooming gbu these changes have been reflected in our segment reporting for all periods presented 

pharmaceuticals divestiture  on october 30 2009 we sold our global pharmaceuticals business to warner chilcott plc warner chilcott for 28 billion under the terms of the agreement warner chilcott acquired our portfolio of branded pharmaceuticals products prescription drug product pipeline and manufacturing facilities in puerto rico and germany the pharmaceuticals business had historically been part of 

  

the health care reportable segment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of longlived assets the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and as such are excluded from continuing operations and from segment results 




 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k the annual report to shareholders quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become out of date or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

a material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing higher margin businesses if demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses our results could be negatively impacted this could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits in addition our continued success is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors 

across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives and trade terms as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition 

our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials cost of labor foreign exchange and interest rates therefore our success is dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects including outsourcing projects sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions in the manufacturing and general overhead areas we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements 

  

we face risks associated with significant international operations 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the united states as a result we are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may reduce the us dollar value of revenues and earnings received andor balances held by or invested in our foreign subsidiaries as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the us that can increase our exposure we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls including but not limited to venezuela china and india our results of operations andor financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks in an increasingly volatile environment further we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions our results could be negatively impacted in addition economic changes terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption inflation deflation or decreased demand for our products our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political andor economic uncertainty especially in our significant geographical markets as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities 

if the reputation of the company or one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

the company’s reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues which could negatively impact sentiments toward the company our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands particularly our billiondollar brands the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products 

our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business results 

we have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies we expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future successfully managing these changes including retention of key employees is critical to our business success in addition we are generally a buildfromwithin company and our success is dependent on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business this includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled employees is limited and competition for these resources is intense further business and organizational changes may result in more reliance on third parties for various services and that reliance may increase compliance risks including anticorruption finally our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth our financial results could be adversely impacted 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against base business objectives specifically our financial results could be adversely impacted if 1 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions 2 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3 we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue streams associated with divested brands 

  

our business is subject to legislation regulation and enforcement in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations and increased enforcement actions may alter the environment in which we do business this includes changes in competition productrelated privacy and environmental laws including actions in response to global climate change concerns increased enforcement as well as changes in accounting standards taxation requirements and enforcement penalties accordingly our ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including product liability patent and other intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in part i item 3 of this form 10k which could require us to take significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period may materially impact our results in addition as a us based multinational company we are also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these or other tax regulations should change our financial results could be impacted 

a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles further there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation which can create significant cost and margin pressure and could lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers this can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes in addition our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products 

we face risks related to changes in the global economic environment 

our business is impacted by global economic conditions which are increasingly volatile if the global economy experiences significant disruptions our business could be negatively impacted including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slowdown in the general economy supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets andor temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers vendors and suppliers 

a failure of a key information technology system process or site could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to interact with internal and external stakeholders these interactions include but are not limited to ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements and other processes necessary to manage the business if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our results of operations andor financial condition in addition we are transitioning our ordering shipping and billing systems in north america and western europe to a new system during fiscal 2011 if the new system does not function properly upon implementation our ability to process and deliver customer orders in our two largest regions could be limited and could negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition also we may be unable to process and receive payments for products sold which could negatively impact our cash flow results during those periods

none 




 item 2 properties 

in the us we own and operate 37 manufacturing facilities located in 23 different states or territories in addition we own and operate 97 manufacturing facilities in 41 other countries many of the domestic and international facilities produce products for multiple businesses beauty products are manufactured at 39 of these locations grooming products at 14 fabric care and home care products at 51 baby care and family care products at 30 snacks and pet care products at 11 and health care products at 35 management believes that the company’s production facilities are adequate to support the business efficiently and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

the company is subject from time to time to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters including antitrust and trade regulation product liability advertising contracts environmental issues patent and trademark matters labor and employment matters and taxes 

the company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in europe the company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations including all antitrust and competition laws and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities which the company is doing 

the company is subject to a number of antitrust investigations in europe in 2006 french authorities in connection with an inquiry into potential competition law violations in france entered the premises of two of the company’s french subsidiaries and seized a variety of documents in 2008 european commission officials with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries started an investigation into potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the european union around the same time the national authorities in spain italy and the czech republic initiated additional investigations into potential antitrust concerns within those countries in connection with these investigations a number of the company’s subsidiaries were visited and documents seized also in 2008 authorities in the united kingdom uk initiated an investigation concerning potential antitrust violations in the uk involving one of the company’s subsidiaries the company or its subsidiaries are also involved in other competition law investigations in germany belgium romania switzerland france and greece as well as some other countries we believe that all of the above matters involve a number of other consumer products companies andor retail customers competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and if violations are found can result in substantial fines in other industries fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars 

in response to the actions of the european commission and national authorities the company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws the company identified violations in certain european countries and appropriate actions were taken 

during this fiscal year authorities in france germany italy spain and switzerland have issued complaints alleging that the company along with several other companies engaged in violations of competition laws the company has the opportunity to respond to these complaints the remaining matters discussed above are in various stages of the investigatory process 

it is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the total amount of fines to which the company will be subject as a result of these various competition law issues however we have taken and will take reserves as appropriate please refer to the company’s risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k for additional information 

  

in december 2008 the company became aware of an investigation by italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the company’s european affiliates the accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another italian authorities have commenced a formal criminal proceeding regarding whether the company’s local affiliate and certain of its employees complied with italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products should they find that these entities violated the law the italian authorities could levy fines in excess of 100 thousand against the company’s european affiliates

 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k the annual report to shareholders quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become out of date or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking 

  

statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

a material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing higher margin businesses if demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses our results could be negatively impacted this could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits in addition our continued success is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors 

across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives and trade terms as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition 

our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials cost of labor foreign exchange and interest rates therefore our success is dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects including outsourcing projects sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions in the manufacturing and general overhead areas we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements 

we face risks associated with significant international operations 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the united states as a result we are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may reduce the us dollar value of revenues and earnings received andor balances held by or invested in our foreign subsidiaries as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the us that can increase our exposure we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls including but not limited to venezuela china and india our results of operations andor financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks further we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by 

  

achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions our results could be negatively impacted in addition economic changes terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption inflation deflation or decreased demand for our products our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political andor economic uncertainty especially in our significant geographical markets as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities 

if the reputation of one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results 

our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands particularly our billiondollar brands the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues 

our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business results 

we have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies we expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future successfully managing these changes including retention of key employees is critical to our business success in addition we are generally a buildfromwithin company and our success is dependent on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business further our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth our financial results could be adversely impacted 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results 

as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activities we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities while at the same time delivering against base business objectives specifically our financial results could be adversely impacted if 1 we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions 2 changes in the cash flows or other marketbased assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3 we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue streams associated with divested brands 

our business is subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements accordingly our ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including product liability patent and intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in part i item 3 of this form 10k which could require us to take significant reserves or pay significant fines during a reporting period may materially impact our results in addition as a us based multinational company we are also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these or other tax regulations should change our financial results could be impacted 

  

a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles further there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation which can create significant cost and margin pressure and could lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers this can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes in addition our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products 

we face risks related to the current credit crisis 

we currently generate significant operating cash flows which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity however current uncertainty in global economic conditions resulting from disruptions in credit markets poses a risk to the overall economy that could impact consumer and customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors including financial institutions if the current situation deteriorates significantly our business could be negatively impacted including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slowdown in the general economy supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets andor temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct daytoday transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers vendors and suppliers if the current credit crisis were to continue to worsen such that we were unable to access the credit market it could impair our ability to fund discretionary spending 

a failure of a key information technology system process or site could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to interact with internal and external stakeholders these interactions include but are not limited to ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements and other processes necessary to manage the business if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our results of operations andor financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

the company is subject from time to time to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters including antitrust and trade regulation product liability advertising contracts environmental issues patent and trademark matters and taxes 

the company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in europe in july 2006 french authorities in connection with an inquiry into potential competition law violations in france entered the premises of two of the company’s french subsidiaries and seized a variety of documents in april 2008 authorities in the united kingdom uk initiated an investigation concerning potential antitrust violations in the uk involving one of the company’s subsidiaries in june 2008 european commission officials with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries started an investigation into potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the european union around the same time the national authorities in spain italy and the czech republic initiated additional investigations into potential antitrust concerns within those countries in connection with these investigations a number of the company’s subsidiaries were visited and documents seized the company or its subsidiaries are also involved in other competition law investigations in belgium romania switzerland france and greece as well as some other countries we believe that all of the above matters involve a number of other consumer products companies andor retail customers 

the company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations including all antitrust and competition laws and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities which the company is doing competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and if violations are found can result in substantial fines in other industries fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 certain of the company’s subsidiaries in germany received a formal complaint alleging violations of the antitrust laws we are now discussing the situation with the german authorities at this point no other formal claims have been made against the company or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any of the above inquiries 

in response to the actions of the commission and national authorities the company has launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws some of which are ongoing the company has identified violations in certain european countries and appropriate actions are being taken it is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the fines to which the company will be subject as a result of these competition law issues however we have taken and will take reserves as appropriate please refer to the company’s risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k for additional information 

in december 2008 the company became aware of an investigation by italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the company’s european affiliates the accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another italian authorities are formally investigating whether the company’s affiliates complied with italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products should they find that these entities violated the law the italian authorities could levy fines in excess of 100 thousand against the company’s european affiliates

 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k the annual report to shareholders quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become out of date or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

a material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing higher margin businesses if demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses our results could be negatively impacted this could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits in addition our continued success is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors 

across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives and trade terms as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition 

our ability to successfully integrate key acquisitions such as gillette could impact our business results 

since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions we must be able to successfully manage and integrate key acquisitions such as the acquisition of the gillette company specifically we must be able to integrate acquisitions without any significant disruption to our ability to manage and execute business plans on our base businesses in addition our financial results could be adversely impacted if we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions 

our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials cost of labor foreign exchange and interest rates our costs in 2008 were impacted by higher commodity costs and this trend is likely to continue in 2009 therefore our success is dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects including outsourcing projects sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions in the manufacturing and general overhead areas we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements 

we face risks associated with significant international operations 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the united states we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions our results could be negatively impacted in addition economic changes terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption inflation deflation or decreased demand for our products our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political andor economic uncertainty especially in our significant geographical markets as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities 

our business is subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements accordingly our ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including product liability patent and intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in part i item 3 of this form 10k which could require the company to take significant reserves or pay significant fines during a reporting period may materially impact our results 

if the reputation of one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results  

our company’s financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands particularly our billiondollar brands the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our company’s results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues 

a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles further there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation and this leads to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers this can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes further our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products

 item 3 legal proceedings 

the company is subject from time to time to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters including antitrust and trade regulation product liability advertising contracts environmental issues patent and trademark matters and taxes 

recently the company has become subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in the european union in july 2006 french authorities in connection with an inquiry into potential competition law violations in france entered the premises of two of the company’s french subsidiaries and seized a variety of documents in april 2008 uk authorities initiated an investigation concerning potential antitrust violations in the uk involving one of the company’s subsidiaries in june 2008 european commission officials with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries started an investigation into potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the european union at the same time the national authorities in spain and italy initiated additional investigations into potential antitrust concerns within those countries in connection with these investigations a number of the company’s subsidiaries were visited and documents seized the company or its 

subsidiaries are also involved in other competition law investigations in belgium romania and greece we believe that all of the above matters involve a number of other consumer products companies andor retail customers the company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations including all antitrust and competition laws 

competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and if violations are found can result in substantial fines at this point no formal claims have been made against the company or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any of above inquiries 

during the fiscal year just ended certain of the company’s subsidiaries in germany received a formal complaint alleging violations of the antitrust laws we are now discussing the situation with the german authorities

financial information about segments 

in fiscal year 2007 the company was organized into three global business units beauty and health household care and gillette gbu we had seven reportable segments under us gaap beauty health care fabric care and home care snacks coffee and pet care baby care and family care blades and razors and duracell and braun many of the factors necessary for an understanding of these businesses are similar operating margins of the individual businesses vary slightly due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets of each business and products none of our businesses are highly seasonal except our duracell and braun businesses which have a disproportionately high level of sales in the december quarter due to the december holiday season in addition anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters such as hurricanes can drive unusually high demand for batteries 

we recently announced a number of changes to our organization structure and certain of our key leadership positions which resulted in changes to our gbu and segment structure effective fiscal year 2008 specifically our fiscal 2008 structure is comprised of three gbus with a total of six reportable segments 

 

the businesses that previously comprised the gillette gbu will now be included within the beauty and household care gbus as a result of these moves the duracell and braun businesses will no longer comprise a separate reportable segment the braun business will be managed and combined with the blades and razors business to form the “grooming” reportable segment within the beauty gbu the grooming reportable segment will also include all shave prep products currently being reported within the beauty reportable segment the duracell business will be moved to our household care gbu and will be reported as part of our fabric care and home care reportable segment finally our feminine care business which was part of our beauty gbu and reportable segment will now be moved to our health and well being gbu and will be managed and reported as part of the health care reportable segment 

these changes were effective as of july 1 2007 they will be reflected in our segment reporting beginning in fiscal year 2008 at which time our historical segment reporting will also be restated to reflect the new structure the gbu and segment discussion in this form 10k reflects the organizational structure that existed through june 30 2007 

additional information about our businesses can be found in management’s discussion and analysis pages 3148 and note 12 segment information which appears on pages 6768 of the annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007

  trademarks and patents  we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products the trademarks of all major products in each business are registered in part our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks patents and licenses 

  competitive condition the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies including wellknown global competitors we market our products with advertising promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force we believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products product quality performance value and packaging are also important competitive factors

development of the business 

the discussion below provides insight to the general development of our business including the material acquisitions and disposition of assets over the past five years 

  gillette acquisition on october 1 2005 we completed the acquisition of the gillette company pursuant to the acquisition agreement which provided for the exchange of 0975 shares of the procter  gamble company common stock on a taxfree basis for each share of the gillette company we issued 962 million shares of the procter  gamble company common stock the value of these shares was determined using the average of company stock prices beginning two days before and ending two days after january 28 2005 the date the acquisition was announced we also issued 79 million stock options in exchange for the gillette company’s outstanding stock options under the purchase method of accounting the total consideration was approximately 5343 billion including common stock the fair value of vested stock options and acquisition costs 

the acquisition of the gillette company provides us with global market leadership in male grooming selected female grooming products alkaline batteries and in manual and power toothbrushes total sales for the gillette company during its most recent preacquisition year ended december 31 2004 were 105 billion 

in order to obtain regulatory approval of the transaction we were required to divest certain overlapping businesses we completed the divestiture of the spinbrush toothbrush business rembrandt a gillette oral care product line and right guard and other gillette deodorant brands during the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 

  juice divestiture in august 2004 the company completed the divestiture of its juice business 

  wella acquisition  in september 2003 the company acquired a controlling interest in wella through a stock purchase agreement with the majority shareholders of wella and a tender offer made on the remaining shares we acquired approximately 81 of the outstanding wella shares 99 of the voting class shares and 45 of the preference shares in june 2004 the company and wella entered into a domination and profit transfer agreement the domination agreement under the domination agreement we are entitled to exercise full operating control and receive 100 of the future earnings of wella as consideration for the domination agreement we will pay the remaining shareholders of wella a guaranteed annual dividend payment alternatively the remaining wella shareholders may elect to tender their shares to the company for an agreed price the fair value of the total guaranteed annual dividend payments was 111 billion which is the approximate cost if all remaining shares were tendered during the year ended june 30 2006 a portion of the remaining shares were tendered resulting in a 944 million reduction in our liability under the domination agreement 

the total purchase price for wella including acquisition costs was 627 billion based on exchange rates at the acquisition dates the acquisition was financed by a mixture of available cash balances debt and the liability recorded under the domination agreement

 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k the annual report to shareholders quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become out of date or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

a material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing higher margin businesses if demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses our results could be negatively impacted this could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits in addition our continued success is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors 

across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives and trade terms as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition 

our ability to successfully integrate key acquisitions primarily gillette could impact our business results 

since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions we must be able to successfully manage and integrate key acquisitions such as the acquisition of the gillette company specifically we must be able to integrate acquisitions without any significant disruption to our ability to manage and execute business plans on our base businesses in addition our financial results could be adversely impacted if we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions 

our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials cost of labor foreign exchange and interest rates our costs in 2007 were impacted by higher commodity costs and this trend is likely to continue in 2008 therefore our success is dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects including outsourcing projects sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions in the manufacturing and general overhead areas we need to maintain key 

manufacturing and supply arrangements including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements 

we face risks associated with significant international operations 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the united states we expect to achieve our financial targets in part by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions our results could be negatively impacted in addition economic changes terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption inflation deflation or decreased demand for our products our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political andor economic uncertainty especially in our significant geographical markets as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities 

our business is subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements accordingly our ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including product liability patent and intellectual property matters as well as those related to the integration of gillette and its subsidiaries and to resolve pending matters within current estimates may impact our results 

if the reputation of one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly it could have a material impact on our financial results  

our company’s financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands particularly our billiondollar brands the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our company’s results could be impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues 

a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles further there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation and this leads to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers this can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes further our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products

financial information about segments 

in april 2006 we announced a number of changes to certain key leadership positions which resulted in changes to our organization structure and segment reporting these changes dissolved our family health global business unit gbu by realigning the component businesses within our remaining gbu’s specifically pet health and nutrition which used to be part of our health care reportable segment became part of our snacks and coffee reportable segment the balance of our health care reportable segment was combined with the pg beauty gbu but will continue to be reported as a separate reportable segment in addition our commercial products organization which primarily sells cleaning products directly to commercial end users was moved from snacks and coffee to the fabric care and home care reportable segment finally the adult incontinence business was aligned with feminine care and as a consequence was removed from baby care and family care and moved to pg beauty the balance of the baby care and family care reportable segment was moved from the family health gbu to the household care gbu but will continue to be reported as a separate reportable segment 

in conjunction with these changes the pg beauty gbu was renamed “beauty and health” the snacks and coffee reporting segment was renamed “pet health snacks and coffee” pg household care was renamed “household care” and the family health gbu was 

eliminated all financial statements contained in this form 10k including historical financial data reflect the new segment reporting structure 

the company is organized into three global business units beauty and health household care and gillette gbu we have seven reportable segments under us gaap beauty health care fabric care and home care pet health snacks and coffee baby care and family care blades and razors and duracell and braun many of the factors necessary for an understanding of these businesses are similar operating margins of the individual businesses vary slightly due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets of each business and products none of our businesses are highly seasonal except duracell and braun the duracell and braun segment has a disproportionately high level of sales in the december quarter due to the december holiday season in addition anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters such as hurricanes can drive unusually high demand for batteries 

additional information about our businesses can be found in management’s discussion and analysis pages 2527 and note 12 segment information which appears on pages 6162 of the annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 

narrative description of business 

  business model  our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products as well as the creation of new products the markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive our products are sold in over 180 countries around the world primarily through mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores and drug stores we have also expanded our presence in “highfrequency stores” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets we work collaboratively with our customers to improve the instore presence of our products and win the “first moment of truth” — when a consumer is shopping in the store we must also win the “second moment of truth” — when a consumer uses the product evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and whether it was a good value we believe we must continue to provide new innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business research and product development activities designed to enable sustained organic growth continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year while many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years we believe these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth 

  key product categories  in 2006 one product category accounted for 10 or more of consolidated net sales the laundry category constituted approximately 16 of net sales for fiscal year 2006 compared to 17 of net sales for fiscal year 2005 and 18 in 2004 in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 we had three product categories including the laundry category described above that accounted for 10 or more of consolidated net sales the diaper category represented approximately 11 of net sales in both 2005 and 2004 the retail hair care category accounted for approximately 10 of net sales in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 fiscal year 2006 net sales percentages for the above categories decreased due to the addition of the gillette company on october 1 2005 

  key customers  our customers include mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores and highfrequency stores sales to walmart stores inc and its affiliates represent approximately 15 of our total revenue in 2006 16 in 2005 and 17 in 2004 no other customer represents more than 10 of our net sales our top ten customers account for approximately 31 of total unit volume in 2006 compared to 32 in 2005 and 33 in 2004 the nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government we believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete 

  sources and availability of materials  almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the company are purchased from others some of whom are singlesource suppliers we produce raw materials primarily chemicals for further use in the manufacturing process in addition fuel and natural gas are important commodities used in our plants and in the trucks used to deliver our products to customers the prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation when prices for these items change we may or may not pass on the change to our customers depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the change in 2006 we increased prices in many categories including fabric care home care baby care family care pet health and coffee to recover increases in commodity costs the company purchases a substantial variety of raw and packaging materials no one of which is material to our business taken as a whole 

  trademarks and patents  we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products the trademarks of all major products in each business are registered in part our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks patents and licenses 

  competitive condition the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies including wellknown global competitors we market our products with advertising promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force we believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products product quality performance value and packaging are also important competitive factors 

  research and development expenditures research and development expenditures enable pg to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of its consumers total research and development expenses were 2075 million in 2006 1940 million in 2005 and 1802 million in 2004 

  expenditures for environmental compliance  expenditures for compliance with federal state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the company no material change is expected in fiscal year 2007 

  employees  the company has approximately 138000 employees the increase of approximately 28000 employees versus the prior year is primarily related to the addition of the 

gillette company during the fiscal year approximately 2800 employee positions were eliminated from the company as a result of the gillette acquisition 

financial information about foreign and domestic operations 

net sales in the united states account for approximately 43 of total net sales no other individual country had net sales exceeding 10 of total net sales operations outside the united states are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also be affected by additional factors including changing currency values different rates of inflation economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and disruptions our sales by geography for the fiscal years ended june 30 were as follows 

 

developing markets include latin america central  eastern europemiddle east and africa greater china and aseanaustralasiaindia 

net sales and assets in the united states and internationally were as follows in millions

 item 1a risk factors 

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10k the annual report to shareholders quarterly reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become out of date or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight 

what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

a material change in the demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 

we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment in addition our continued success is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world 

the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors 

across all of our categories we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors as a result there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins to address these challenges we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors including pricing promotional incentives and trade terms as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition 

our ability to successfully integrate key acquisitions primarily gillette could impact our business results 

since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions we must be able to successfully manage and integrate key acquisitions such as the acquisition of the gillette company specifically we must be able to integrate acquisitions without any significant disruption to our ability to manage and execute business plans on our base businesses in addition our financial results could be adversely impacted if we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions 

our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results 

our costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials cost of labor foreign exchange and interest rates our costs in 2006 were impacted by higher commodity costs and this trend is likely to continue in 2007 therefore our success is dependent in part on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions cost savings projects including outsourcing projects sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions in the manufacturing and general overhead areas we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements 

we face risks associated with significant international operations 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the united states economic changes terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption inflation deflation or decreased demand for our products our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political andor economic uncertainty 

especially in our significant geographical markets as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities 

our business is subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements accordingly our ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including product liability patent and intellectual property matters as well as those related to the integration of gillette and its subsidiaries and to resolve pending matters within current estimates may impact our results

financial information about segments 

the company is organized into three global business units pg beauty pg family health and pg household care we have five reportable segments under us gaap pg beauty health care baby care and family care fabric care and home care and snacks and coffee none of these businesses is highly seasonal many of the factors necessary for an understanding of these businesses are similar operating margins of the individual businesses vary slightly due to nature of the materials and processes used to manufacture the products the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets of each business and products for example we expect our pg beauty business to provide a disproportionate percentage of overall net sales growth as the market for these products is expected to grow at a higher rate than the remaining businesses 

additional information about our businesses including a discussion of competitive conditions can be found in management’s discussion and analysis pages 2728 and note 11 segment information which appears on pages 6061 of the annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 

effective july 1 2004 we realigned some of our business units and associated management responsibilities concurrent with this change we made adjustments to the measures used to evaluate the performance of senior management the most significant of these adjustments was the amortization expense of identifiable intangible assets with determinable lives which is now included in business results rather than held in corporate while these changes had no impact on total company results historical business results for all periods presented were conformed for these changes 

narrative description of business 

  business model  our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products as well as the creation of new products the markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive our products are sold in over 160 countries around the world primarily through mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores and drug stores we have also expanded our presence in “highfrequency stores” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets we work collaboratively with our customers to improve the instore presence of our products and win the “first moment of truth” — when a consumer is shopping in the store we must also win the “second moment of truth” — when a consumer uses the product evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and whether it was a good value we believe we must continue to provide new innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business research and product development activities designed to enable sustained organic growth continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year while many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years we believe these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth 

  key product categories  we currently have three product categories that each account for 10 or more of consolidated net sales the laundry category constitutes approximately 17 of net sales for fiscal year 2005 compared to 18 of net sales for fiscal year 2004 and 19 in 2003 the diaper category represents approximately 11 of net sales in 2005 compared to 11 in 2004 and 12 in 2003 the retail hair care category accounts for approximately 10 of fiscal year 2005 net sales compared to 11 of fiscal year 2004 net sales and 9 in 2003 

  key customers  our customers include mass merchandisers grocery stores membership club stores drug stores and highfrequency stores sales to walmart stores inc and its affiliates represent approximately 16 of our total revenue compared to 17 in 2004 and 18 in 2003 no other customer represents more than 10 of our net sales our top ten customers account for approximately 32 of total unit volume which is comparable with 2004 and 2003 the nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government we believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete 

  sources and availability of materials  almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the company are purchased from others some of whom are singlesource suppliers we produce raw materials primarily chemicals for further use in the manufacturing process in addition fuel and natural gas are important commodities used in our plants and in the trucks used to deliver our products to customers the prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation for example the price of oil was up approximately 45 in 2005 compared to the prior year the cost of many of the resins used in our raw and packaging materials increased about 20 we also had increases in pulp and chemical costs when prices for these items change we may or may not pass on the change to our customers depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the change in 2005 we increased prices in some categories including family care pet health and nutrition coffee and certain fabric care markets to recover increases in commodity costs the company purchases a substantial variety of raw and packaging materials no one of which is material to our business taken as a whole 

  trademarks and patents  we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products the trademarks of all major products in each business are registered in part our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks patents and licenses
