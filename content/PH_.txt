 item 1a  risk factors  

the following risk factors identify what we believe to be the risks that could materially adversely affect our financial andor operational performance these risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

business and operational risks 

risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions may harm our business and make it difficult to project longterm performance 

our business is sensitive to global macroeconomic conditions future macroeconomic downturns may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as our distributors customers and suppliers and on activity in many of the industries and markets we serve among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing and other endmarket activity global pandemics currency exchange rates air travel trends difficulties entering new markets tariffs and governmental trade and monetary policies and general economic conditions such as inflation deflation interest rates and credit availability these factors may among other things negatively impact our level of purchases capital expenditures and creditworthiness as well as our distributors customers and suppliers and therefore the company’s revenues operating profits margins and order rates 

table of contents 

we cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions and government policies as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond our control if these conditions deteriorate or remain at depressed levels for extended periods however our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

as a global business we are exposed to economic political and other risks in different countries in which we operate which could materially reduce our sales profitability or cash flows or materially increase our liabilities 

our net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 39 percent in 2022 40 percent in 2021 and 37 percent in 2020 in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states the company expects net sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales our nonus operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing our domestic operations including 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates andor changes in monetary policy 

• public health crises including pandemics 

• limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings 

• transportation delays and other supply chain disruptions 

• political social and economic instability and disruptions including armed conflicts 

• government embargoes sanctions or trade restrictions 

• the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers 

• import and export controls 

• labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

• the potential for nationalization of enterprises 

• difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations 

• limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies 

• potentially adverse tax consequences and 

• difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis 

if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally the risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increased cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime have posed and could continue to pose a risk to our information technology systems and a disruption to or breach in the security of such systems if material could have adverse effects on our result of operations and financial condition 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business some of which are managed by third parties the security and functionality of these information technology systems and the processing of data by these systems are critical to our business operations if these systems or any part of the systems are damaged intruded upon attacked shutdown or cease to function properly whether by planned upgrades force majeure telecommunications failures criminal acts including hardware or software breakins or extortion attempts or viruses or other cybersecurity incidents and we suffer any resulting interruption in our ability to manage and operate our business or if our products are affected our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected additionally certain of our employees work remotely at times which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks in addition to existing risks any adoption or deployment of new technologies via acquisitions or internal initiatives may increase our exposure to risks breaches or failures which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition furthermore the company has access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations or other contractuallyimposed controls despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls security breaches theft misplaced lost or corrupted data programming or employee errors andor malfeasance have led and could in the future lead to the compromise or improper use of such sensitive confidential or personal data or information such events may result in possible negative consequences such as fines ransom demands penalties failure to comply with laws governing sensitive data loss of reputation intellectual property competitiveness or customers increased security and compliance costs or other negative consequences further the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity incident depending on the nature and magnitude of these events they may have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

price and supply fluctuations of the raw materials used in our production processes and by our suppliers of component parts could negatively impact our financial results 

our supply of raw materials could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing furthermore changes to united states and other countries tariff and importexport regulations have in the past and may in the future have a negative impact on the availability and pricing of raw materials prices for raw materials necessary for production have 

table of contents 

fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect our results of operations and profit margins our efforts to manage these fluctuations by among other things passing along price increases to our customers may be subject to a time delay between the increased raw material prices and our ability to increase the price of our products or we may be unable to increase the prices of our products due to pricing pressure contract terms or other factors any such inability to manage fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

our suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts as a result we may not be able to increase our prices commensurately with our increased costs consequently our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic along with the response to the pandemic by governmental and other actors has disrupted our operations and is expected to continue to negatively impact our operations in the future which impact may be material we have experienced and may continue to experience mandatory and voluntary facility closures in certain jurisdictions in which we operate furthermore several of our customers temporarily suspended their operations and we have experienced less demand for our products disruptions to our customers in the aerospace industry which is facing diminished demand have been and may continue to be challenging additionally the covid19 outbreak has and could further disrupt our supply chain facility closures or other restrictions as well as supply chain disruptions could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff supply or otherwise maintain our operations moreover because certain of our employees work remotely at times we may be subject to increased vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks we have modified and may further modify our business practices in response to the risks and negative impacts associated with the covid19 pandemic however there can be no assurance that these measures will be temporary or successful 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate duration severity and disruption to our business customers and supply chain and the related financial impact to us cannot be accurately forecasted at this time should such disruption continue for an extended period the adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition could be more severe than previously anticipated additionally weak economic conditions generally as a result of the covid19 pandemic could result in impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets furthermore future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks discussed above 

changes in the demand for and supply of our products may adversely affect our financial results financial condition and cash flow 

demand for and supply of our products has been and may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which we cannot predict or control such factors include 

• changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers suppliers or distributors including delays or cancellations in shipments disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs including changes as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• changes in product mix 

• changes in the market acceptance of our products 

• increased competition in the markets we serve 

• declines in the general level of industrial production including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• weakness in the endmarkets we serve including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• fluctuations in the availability or the prices of raw materials and 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

if any of these factors occur the demand for and supply of our products could suffer which could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

the development of new products and technologies requires substantial investment and is required to remain competitive in the markets we serve if we are unable to successfully introduce new commercial products our profitability could be adversely affected 

the markets we serve are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources if we cannot develop or have difficulties or delays developing new and enhanced products and services or if we fail to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies our 

table of contents 

revenues may be materially reduced and our competitive position could be materially adversely affected in addition we may invest in research and development of products and services or in acquisitions or other investments that do not lead to significant revenue which could adversely affect our profitability 

changes in the competitive environment in which we operate may eliminate any competitive advantages that we currently have which could adversely impact our business 

our operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global regional and local competitors which could adversely affect our results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure andor a decline in our margins or market shares to compete successfully we must excel in terms of product quality and innovation technological and engineering capability manufacturing and distribution capability delivery price competitiveness and customer experience 

we may be required to make material expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations and climate change and legal or regulatory measures to address climate change may negatively impact our business 

our operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and as a result subject us to various us federal state and local laws and regulations as well as nonus laws designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment these laws impose penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills disposals or other releases of or the exposure to hazardous materials among other laws we are subject to the us federal superfund law under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list we could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws including the superfund law 

in addition increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change concerns could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw material costs we are not able to predict how such regulations would affect our business operations or financial results but increased regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

further climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations extreme weather events linked to climate change including hurricanes flooding wildfires high heat and water scarcity among others create physical risks to our operating locations and supply chains although we are working towards and intend to meet our goal of making our own operations carbon neutral by 2040 we may be required to expend significant resources to do so which could increase our operational costs further there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our climaterelated goals will be achieved or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving our goals will meet customer expectations and needs investor expectations or market standards regarding sustainability performance 

strategic transactions risks 

we are subject to risks relating to the pending acquisition of meggitt 

on august 2 2021 we announced our proposed acquisition of meggitt meggitt is a leader in design manufacturing and aftermarket support of technologically differentiated systems and equipment in aerospace defense and selected energy markets 

the proposed acquisition of meggitt would expand the size of our aerospace systems segment relative to our other segment increasing our susceptibility to conditions in the end markets served by our aerospace systems segment there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed acquisition including 

• completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of conditions some of which are outside of our control among these conditions are the receipt of certain regulatory approvals including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and any extension thereof under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvement act of 1976 as amended 

table of contents 

• the company’s and meggitt’s existing business relationships with third parties including customers and service providers may be disrupted due to uncertainty associated with the acquisition which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position or those of the combined company 

• failure to complete the acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results 

• both we and meggitt will incur significant transaction costs in connection with the acquisition which costs may exceed those currently anticipated 

• we have substantially increased our indebtedness to pay for the acquisition and other related fees and expenses 

• the covid19 pandemic may delay or prevent the completion of the acquisition 

• after completion of the acquisition we may be unable to successfully integrate our and meggitt’s business and as a result may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction in the intended timeframe or at all which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

• our results after the proposed acquisition of meggitt may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the acquisition and 

• meggitt may have difficulty retaining motivating and attracting executives and other employees in light of the pending acquisition and failure to do so could harm the company 

any of the foregoing risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our earnings cash flows and financial condition 

we are subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint ventures and risks relating to the integration of acquired companies including risks related to the integration of lord corporation lord and exotic metals forming company exotic and the potential acquisition of meggitt 

we expect to continue our strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services and entering into joint ventures which we believe will enhance our operations and profitability however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities or that we will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms furthermore there are no assurances that we will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities if we are unable to avoid these risks our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

in addition we may not be able to integrate successfully any businesses that we purchase into our existing business and it is possible that any acquired businesses or joint ventures may not be profitable for example we have devoted significant management attention and resources to integrating the business and operations of lord and exotic we may encounter or have encountered the following difficulties during the integration process 

• the consequences of a change in tax treatment including the cost of integration and compliance and the possibility that the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions may not be realized 

• delays in the integration of management teams strategies operations products and services 

• differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies that may delay successful integration 

• the ability to retain key employees 

• the ability to create and enforce uniform standards controls procedures policies and information systems 

• challenges of integrating complex systems technologies networks and other assets of the acquired companies in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact or disruptions to customers suppliers employees and other constituencies and 

• unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration beyond current estimates 

the successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures also depend on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs if we are unable to avoid these risks our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our results may be adversely affected if expanded operations from the acquisition of lord and exotic and the potential acquisition of meggitt are not effectively managed 

our recent acquisitions have greatly expanded the size and complexity of our business our future success depends in part on the ability to manage this expanded business which may pose or has posed substantial challenges for management 

table of contents 

including challenges related to the management and monitoring of the expanded global operations and new manufacturing processes and products and the associated costs and complexity there can be no assurance of successful management of these matters or that we will realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions 

the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes 

we regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies we also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs the company commits significant resources to identify develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction if we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all 

financial risks 

increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our liability for such benefits 

the funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets which are dependent on actual plan asset returns significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations

supply chain financing 

we continue to identify opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers we currently have a supply chain financing program scf with a financial intermediary which provides certain suppliers the option to be paid by the financial intermediary earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice we are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial intermediary and the suppliers in connection with the programs the range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program we do not reimburse suppliers for any costs they incur for participation in the program and their participation is completely voluntary amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the scf program are included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet at june 30 2022 accounts payable included approximately 46 million payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the scf program in 2022 the amount settled through the scf program and paid to participating financial institutions totaled 35 million we account for payments made under the program in the same manner as our other accounts payable which is a reduction to our cash flows from operations we do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment 

revenue recognition  revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations which are distinct goods or services within the contract is transferred to the customer control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services a majority of our revenues are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment however a portion of our revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced or if the product has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment 

for contracts where revenue is recognized over time we use the costtocost efforts expended or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract including length of production time the estimation of costs and efforts expended requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved adjustments to these estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues 

when there are multiple performance obligations within a contract the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price the primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer 

we consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period these estimates are based on historical experience anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value our six reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units determining whether an impairment occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit which is estimated using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the incomebased valuation method utilizes a discounted cash flow model which requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industryspecific market conditions each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis within the discounted cash flow models the company uses a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital but adjusted for inherent business risks and an appropriate terminal growth factor the marketbased valuation performed for each reporting unit includes an analysis consisting of marketadjusted multiples based on key data points for guideline public companies we also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulting from these procedures to our overall market capitalization 

at december 31 2021 the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its six reporting units the results of this test indicated the fair value substantially exceeded carrying value for all reporting units we continually monitor our reporting units for impairment indicators and update assumptions used in the most recent calculation of a reporting units fair value as appropriate 

table of contents 

longlived assets held for use which primarily includes finitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value the longterm nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test during 2022 the company did not record any material impairment related to longlived assets 

pensions  the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the companys defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis this determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate longterm rate of return on plan assets increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements 

for the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan a 50 basis point decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets is estimated to increase annual pension expense by 17 million and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by 19 million as of june 30 2022 472 million of past years net actuarial losses related to the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future these losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future any actuarial gains experienced in future years will help offset the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization further information on pensions is provided in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes  significant judgment is required in determining the companys income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities factors considered by the company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse the company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements further information on income taxes is provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

loss contingencies  the company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims product liability and litigation reserves establishing loss accruals for these matters requires managements estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization we review these loss accruals periodically and make adjustments to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  

the company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and nonderivative financial instruments including forward exchange contracts costless collar contracts crosscurrency swap contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges the derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and we do not anticipate any material nonperformance by any of the counterparties the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

in connection with the proposed acquisition the company entered into dealcontingent forward contracts during october 2021 to mitigate the risk of appreciation in the gbpdenominated purchase price the dealcontingent forward contracts have an aggregate notional amount of £6415 million and settlement is contingent upon closing the proposed acquisition a one percent decrease in the gbpusd exchange rate would result in a 78 million decrease in the fair value of the contract 

derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through the consolidated statement of income derivatives that are designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings for crosscurrency swaps measured using the spot method the periodic interest settlements are recognized directly in earnings through interest expense the translation of the foreign currency denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated 

the companys debt portfolio contains variable rate debt inherently exposing the company to interest rate risk the companys objective is to maintain a 6040 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in nearterm interest rates at june 30 2022 our debt portfolio did not include any variable rate debt however a 100 basis point increase in nearterm interest rates would increase annual interest expense on weighted average commercial paper balances during 2022 by approximately 15 million 

as discussed elsewhere in this report the future impacts of the russiaukraine war and the covid19 pandemic and their residual effects including economic uncertainty inflationary environment and disruption within the global supply chain labor markets and aerospace industry on our business remain uncertain as we cannot anticipate the ultimate duration or scope of the russiaukraine war and the covid19 pandemic the ultimate financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material

 item 1a  risk factors  

the following risk factors identify what we believe to be the risks that could materially adversely affect our financial andor operational performance these risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

business and operational risks 

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic along with the response to the pandemic by governmental and other actors has disrupted our operations and is expected to continue to negatively impact our operations in the future which impact may be material we have experienced and may continue to experience mandatory and voluntary facility closures in certain jurisdictions in which we operate furthermore several of our customers temporarily suspended their operations and we have experienced less demand for our products disruptions to our customers in the aerospace industry which is facing diminished demand have been and may continue to be challenging additionally the covid19 outbreak has and could further disrupt our supply chain facility closures or other restrictions as well as supply chain disruptions could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff supply or otherwise maintain our operations moreover because certain of our employees continue to work from home we may be subject to increased vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks we have modified and may further modify our business practices in response to the risks and negative impacts associated with the covid19 pandemic however there can be no assurance that these measures will be temporary or successful 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate duration severity and disruption to our business customers and supply chain and the related financial impact to us cannot be accurately forecasted at this time should such disruption continue for an extended period the adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition could be more severe than previously anticipated additionally weak economic conditions generally as a result of the covid19 pandemic could result in impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets furthermore future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks discussed above 

risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions may harm our business and make it difficult to project longterm performance 

our business is sensitive to global macroeconomic conditions future macroeconomic downturns may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as our distributors customers and suppliers and on activity in many of the industries and markets we serve among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing and other endmarket activity global pandemics currency exchange rates air travel trends difficulties entering new markets tariffs and governmental trade and monetary policies and general economic conditions such as inflation deflation interest rates and credit availability these factors may among other things negatively impact our level of purchases capital expenditures and creditworthiness as well as our distributors customers and suppliers and therefore the company’s revenues operating profits margins and order rates 

we cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions and government policies as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond our control if these conditions deteriorate or remain at depressed levels for extended periods however our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

as a global business we are exposed to economic political and other risks in different countries in which we operate which could materially reduce our sales profitability or cash flows or materially increase our liabilities 

our net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 40 percent in 2021 37 percent in 2020 and 39 percent in 2019 in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states the company expects net sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales our nonus operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing our domestic operations including 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates andor changes in monetary policy 

• public health crises including pandemics 

• limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings 

• transportation delays and interruptions 

• political social and economic instability and disruptions 

• government embargoes or trade restrictions 

• the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers 

• import and export controls 

• labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

• the potential for nationalization of enterprises 

• difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations 

• limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies 

• potentially adverse tax consequences and 

• difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis 

if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally the risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increased cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business some of which are managed by third parties the security and functionality of these information technology systems and the processing of data by these systems are critical to our business operations if these systems or any part of the systems are damaged intruded upon attacked shutdown or cease to function properly whether by planned upgrades force majeure telecommunications failures criminal acts including hardware or software breakins or extortion attempts or viruses or other cybersecurity incidents and we suffer any resulting interruption in our ability to manage and operate our business or if our products are affected our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected as a result of the covid19 pandemic certain of our employees continue to work from home which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks in addition to existing risks any adoption or deployment of new technologies via acquisitions or internal initiatives may increase our exposure to risks breaches or failures which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition furthermore the company may have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that may be subject to privacy and security laws regulations or other contractuallyimposed controls despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls material security breaches theft misplaced lost or corrupted data programming or employee errors andor malfeasance could lead to the compromise or improper use of such sensitive confidential or personal data or information resulting in possible negative consequences such as fines ransom demands penalties loss of reputation competitiveness or customers or other negative consequences resulting in adverse impacts to our results of operations or financial condition 

changes in the demand for and supply of our products may adversely affect our financial results financial condition and cash flow 

demand for and supply of our products has been and may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which we cannot predict or control such factors include 

• changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers suppliers or distributors including delays or cancellations in shipments disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs including changes as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• changes in product mix 

• changes in the market acceptance of our products 

• increased competition in the markets we serve 

• declines in the general level of industrial production including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• weakness in the endmarkets we serve including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• fluctuations in the availability or the prices of raw materials and 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

if any of these factors occur the demand for and supply of our products could suffer which could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

the development of new products and technologies requires substantial investment and is required to remain competitive in the markets we serve if we are unable to successfully introduce new commercial products our profitability could be adversely affected 

the markets we serve are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources if we cannot develop or have difficulties or delays developing new and enhanced products and services or if we fail to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies our revenues may be materially reduced and our competitive position could be materially adversely affected in addition we may invest in research and development of products and services or in acquisitions or other investments that do not lead to significant revenue which could adversely affect our profitability 

price and supply fluctuations of the raw materials used in our production processes and by our suppliers of component parts could negatively impact our financial results 

our supply of raw materials could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing furthermore changes to united states and other countries tariff and importexport regulations have in the past and may in the future have a negative impact on the availability and pricing of raw materials prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect our results of operations and profit margins our efforts to manage these fluctuations by among other things passing along price increases to our customers may be subject to a time delay between the increased raw material prices and our ability to increase the price of our products or we may be unable to increase the prices of our products due to pricing pressure contract terms or other factors any such inability to manage fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

our suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts as a result we may not be able to increase our prices commensurately with our increased costs consequently our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

changes in the competitive environment in which we operate may eliminate any competitive advantages that we currently have which could adversely impact our business 

our operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global regional and local competitors which could adversely affect our results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure andor a decline in our margins or market shares to compete successfully we must excel in terms of product quality and innovation technological and engineering capability manufacturing and distribution capability delivery price competitiveness and customer experience 

strategic transactions risks 

we are subject to risks relating to the pending acquisition of meggitt 

on august 2 2021 we announced our proposed acquisition of meggitt meggitt is a leader in design manufacturing and aftermarket support of technically differentiated systems and equipment in aerospace defense and selected energy markets 

the proposed acquisition of meggitt would expand the size of our aerospace systems segment relative to our other segment increasing our susceptibility to conditions in the end markets served by our aerospace systems segment there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed acquisition including 

• completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of conditions some of which are outside of our control among these conditions are the approval by meggitt’s stockholders of the acquisition and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and any extension thereof under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvement act of 1976 as amended and under the antitrust and foreign investmentnational security laws of certain other nonus jurisdictions including the united kingdom and european union 

• the company’s and meggitt’s existing business relationships with third parties including customers and service providers may be disrupted due to uncertainty associated with the acquisition which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position or those of the combined company 

• failure to complete the acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results 

• both we and meggitt will incur significant transaction costs in connection with the acquisition which costs may exceed those currently anticipated 

• we intend to pay for the acquisition of meggitt and pay other fees and expenses required to be paid in connection with the acquisition with cash on hand and proceeds of new indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute such financing transactions on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all 

• the covid19 pandemic may delay or prevent the completion of the acquisition 

• after completion of the acquisition we may be unable to successfully integrate our and meggitt’s business and as a result may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction in the intended timeframe or at all which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

• our results after the proposed acquisition of meggitt may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the acquisition and 

• meggitt may have difficulty retaining motivating and attracting executives and other employees in light of the pending acquisition and failure to do so could harm the company 

any of the foregoing risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our earnings cash flows and financial condition 

we are subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint ventures and risks relating to the integration of acquired companies including risks related to the integration of lord corporation lord and exotic metals forming company exotic and the potential acquisition of meggitt 

we expect to continue our strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services and entering into joint ventures which we believe will enhance our operations and profitability however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities or that we will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms furthermore there are no assurances that we will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities if we are unable to avoid these risks our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

in addition we may not be able to integrate successfully any businesses that we purchase into our existing business and it is possible that any acquired businesses or joint ventures may not be profitable for example we have devoted significant management attention and resources to integrating the business and operations of lord and exotic we may encounter or have encountered the following difficulties during the integration process 

• the consequences of a change in tax treatment including the cost of integration and compliance and the possibility that the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions may not be realized 

• delays in the integration of management teams strategies operations products and services 

• differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies that may delay successful integration 

• the ability to retain key employees 

• the ability to create and enforce uniform standards controls procedures policies and information systems 

• challenges of integrating complex systems technologies networks and other assets of the acquired companies in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact or disruptions to customers suppliers employees and other constituencies and 

• unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration beyond current estimates 

the successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures also depend on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs if we are unable to avoid these risks our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our results may be adversely affected if expanded operations from the acquisition of lord and exotic and the potential acquisition of meggitt are not effectively managed 

our recent acquisitions have greatly expanded the size and complexity of our business our future success depends in part on the ability to manage this expanded business which may pose or has posed substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of the expanded global operations and new manufacturing processes and products and the associated costs and complexity there can be no assurance of successful management of these matters or that we will realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions 

the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes 

we regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies we also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs the company commits significant resources to identify develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction if we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all 

financial risks 

increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our liability for such benefits 

the funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets which are dependent on actual plan asset returns significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations 

the company absorbs a portion of healthcare costs for its employees if healthcare costs rise significantly and we continue to absorb the majority of these costs these increasing costs may adversely impact our future results of operations 

additional liabilities relating to changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various nonus jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions our future results of operation could be adversely affected by changes in effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws and judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in overall profitability changes in us generally accepted accounting principles gaap or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets in addition the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

our indebtedness and restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could limit our operational and financial flexibility 

we have incurred significant indebtedness and may and expect to if the potential acquisition of meggitt is completed incur additional debt for acquisitions operations research and development and capital expenditures or for other reasons related to our overall capital deployment strategy our ability to make interest and scheduled principal payments and meet restrictive covenants could be adversely impacted by changes in the availability terms and cost of capital changes in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings or our outlook these changes could increase our cost of financing and limit our debt capacity thereby limiting our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities react to market conditions and meet operational and capital needs which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

we carry goodwill on our balance sheet which is subject to impairment testing and could subject us to significant noncash charges to earnings in the future if impairment occurs 

we have goodwill recorded on our balance sheet goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the second quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist factors that could indicate that our goodwill is impaired include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization lower than projected operating results and cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry declines in our stock price lower operating results and any decline in industry conditions in the future could increase the risk of impairment impairment testing incorporates our estimates of future operating results and cash flows estimates of allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units estimates of future growth rates and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used on estimated operating results and cash flows if we determine at a future time that further impairment exists it may result in a significant noncash charge to earnings and lower stockholders’ equity 

legal and regulatory risks 

as a provider of products to the us government we are subject to additional risks related to future government spending as well as unusual performance conditions and enhanced compliance risks 

in addition to the risks identified herein doing business with the us government subjects us to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental acquisition regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform or other unsatisfactory performance under the applicable contract we are subject to government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government acquisition regulations if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts and we could be subject to fines or penalties associated with contract noncompliance or resulting from such investigations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings against the company could decrease our liquidity impair our financial condition and adversely affect our results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome including the outcome of any related appeals an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore as required by us gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to national and international laws and regulations such as the anticorruption laws of the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act relating to our business and our employees despite our policies procedures and compliance programs our internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations any such improper acts could damage the companys reputation subject us to civil or criminal judgments fines or penalties and could otherwise disrupt the companys business and as a result could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

further our operations are subject to certain antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the united states and europe these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements or practices are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we may also be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable accordingly any violation of these laws could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings cash flows and financial condition 

due to the nature of our business and products we may be liable for damages based on product liability claims 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of our products and the products of thirdparty vendors that we use or resell significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms or that our insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential significant liabilities 

failure to protect our intellectual property and knowhow could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage and reduce our sales and profitability and the cost of protecting our intellectual property may be significant 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts we own a number of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks trade names and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services throughout the world and the operation of our business we also have exclusive and nonexclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others our intellectual property may be challenged stolen or otherwise infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with thirdparty owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms in addition the global nature of our business increases the risk that our intellectual property may be subject to infringement theft or other unauthorized use or disclosure by others in some cases our ability to protect our intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property rights or our inability to protect intellectual property and preserve associated intellectual property rights could lead to reputational harm andor adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations 

we may be required to make material expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and climate change regulations or incur additional liabilities under these laws and regulations 

our operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and as a result subject us to various us federal state and local laws and regulations as well as nonus laws designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment these laws impose penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills disposals or other releases of or the exposure to hazardous materials among other laws we are subject to the us federal superfund law under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list we could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws including the superfund law 

in addition increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions including regulation of such emissions through a capandtrade system globally increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change concerns could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw material costs until definitive regulations are adopted we are not able to predict how such regulations would affect our business operations or financial results 

we may be subject to other more stringent environmental laws in the future if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 year ended june 30 2020 amounts have been adjusted to reflect the change in inventory accounting method as described in notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

net sales in 2021 increased from the 2020 amount due to higher volume in both the diversified industrial international and diversified industrial north american businesses partially offset by lower volume in the aerospace systems segment the effect of currency rate changes increased net sales in 2021 by approximately 257 million of which 244 million was attributable to the diversified industrial international operations prioryear acquisitions contributed approximately 394 million in net sales during 2021 

gross profit margin calculated as net sales less cost of sales divided by net sales increased in 2021 primarily due to higher margins in all businesses gross profit margin in 2021 included net foreign currency transaction gains of 11 million and 10 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively gross profit margin also benefited from the absence of acquisitionrelated expenses which were included in cost of sales in 2020 of 69 million cost of sales included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of 35 million in 2021 compared to 60 million in 2020 

selling general and administrative expenses sga decreased eight percent in 2021 primarily due to benefits from lower discretionary spending and wage and salary expense resulting from actions taken in response to business conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic during 2021 sga also benefited from the absence of acquisitionrelated expenses of 119 million which were incurred in 2020 these benefits were partially offset by higher intangible asset amortization expense related to prioryear acquisitions and higher stock compensation expense sga also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of 23 million and 38 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

interest expense in 2021 decreased due to both lower interest rates and lower average debt outstanding

gain on disposal of assets in 2021 primarily consists of a gain of 101 million on the sale of land in 2020 it includes gains of 12 million on the sale of real estate partially offset by net losses on divestitures and asset sales and writedowns 

effective tax rate in 2021 was higher than 2020 primarily due to an overall decrease in discrete tax benefits 

business segment information 

the business segment information presents sales and operating income on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the companys various businesses are managed for internal review and decisionmaking 

diversified industrial segment 



the diversified industrial segment operations experienced the following percentage changes in net sales 

the above presentation reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the diversified industrial segment reported in accordance with us gaap to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of acquisitions made within the prior four fiscal quarters as well as the effects of currency exchange rates a nongaap measure the effects of acquisitions and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period 

sales in 2021 for the diversified industrial north american operations increased 34 percent from 2020 acquisitions increased sales by 188 million and the effect of currency exchange rates increased sales by approximately 8 million excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes sales in 2021 for the diversified industrial north american operations increased 04 percent from prioryear levels reflecting higher demand from distributors and end users in the refrigeration cars and light truck farm and agriculture and life sciences markets partially offset by a decrease in enduser demand in the oil and gas and general industrial machinery markets 

sales in the diversified industrial international operations increased 173 percent in 2021 acquisitions increased sales by approximately 136 million in 2021 the effect of currency rate changes increased sales by 244 million reflecting the weakening of the us dollar primarily against currencies in the eurozone countries china and the united kingdom excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes sales in 2021 for the diversified industrial international operations increased 89 percent from 2020 levels primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in both the mobile and industrial markets during 2021 the asia pacific region europe and latin america accounted for approximately 60 percent 26 percent and 14 percent respectively of the increase in sales 

within the asia pacific region the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment semiconductor cars and light truck general industrial machinery engine and life sciences markets partially offset by a decrease in enduser demand in the oil and gas market 

within europe the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment heavyduty truck and power generation markets partially offset by a decrease in enduser demand in the general industrial machinery oil and gas and marine markets 

within latin america the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the farm and agriculture construction equipment cars and light truck and heavyduty truck markets partially offset by a decrease in enduser demand in the oil and gas market 

operating margins in 2021 increased in both the diversified industrial north american and international operations primarily due to higher sales volume and benefits from overall cost reductions including lower discretionary spending wage and salary reductions current and prioryear restructuring actions in response to business conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic the absence of acquisitionrelated expenses and productivity improvements 

the following business realignment and acquisition integration charges are included in diversified industrial north america and diversified industrial international operating income 



during 2021 business realignment charges primarily include actions taken to address the impact of covid19 on our business but also include charges related to the company’s simplification initiative the simplification initiative is aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity and is being implemented by operating units around the world during 2020 business realignment charges primarily include charges related to the company’s simplification initiative but also include permanent workforce reductions to address the impact of covid19 on our business acquisition integration charges relate to the 2020 acquisition of lord 

the majority of the diversified industrial international business realignment and acquisition integration charges were incurred in europe we anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2021 will increase operating income for 2022 by approximately one percent in both the diversified industrial north american and international operations in 2022 we expect to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the diversified industrial segment these actions are expected to result in approximately 40 million in business realignment and acquisition integration charges in 2022 however continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur 

the increase in diversified industrial segment backlog in 2021 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in both the north american and international businesses with each business accounting for approximately 50 percent of the change within the international business this increase in backlog was primarily related to orders exceeding shipments in both europe and the asia pacific region backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and in the case of blanket purchase orders only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale 

aerospace systems segment   



sales in 2021 were lower than the 2020 level primarily due to lower volume in the commercial oem and aftermarket businesses due to the market conditions as a result of covid19 this decrease was partially offset by higher volume in the military oem and aftermarket businesses as well as a 71 million increase in sales from prioryear acquisitions 

operating margin decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower sales volume in the commercial oem and aftermarket businesses and lower aftermarket profitability lower sales volume and aftermarket profitability were partially offset by lower engineering development expenses overall cost reductions lower business realignment and acquisition integration charges and the benefits from such actions 

the disruption in the aerospace industry due to the covid19 pandemic has been significant and we have taken actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the aerospace systems segment we do not currently intend to incur significant additional business realignment and acquisition integration charges in 2022 however continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur we anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2021 will increase segment operating income for 2022 by approximately two percent 

the increase in backlog in 2021 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the military oem business partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the military aftermarket and commercial oem and aftermarket businesses backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and in the case of blanket purchase orders only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale 

corporate general  administrative expenses 



corporate general and administrative expenses increased slightly in 2021 primarily due to increases in stock compensation expense deferred compensation expense and charitable contributions these increases were partially offset by benefits from lower discretionary spending and wage and salary expense as a result of actions taken in response to business conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic

our goal is to maintain an investmentgrade credit profile the rating agencies periodically update our credit ratings as events occur at june 30 2021 the longterm credit ratings assigned to the companys senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the company were as follows

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment 

revenue recognition  revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations which are distinct goods or services within the contract is transferred to the customer control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services a majority of our revenues are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment however a portion of our revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced or if the product has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment 

for contracts where revenue is recognized over time we use the costtocost efforts expended or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract including length of production time the estimation of costs and efforts expended requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved adjustments to these estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues 

when there are multiple performance obligations within a contract the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price the primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer 

we consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period these estimates are based on historical experience anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value our six reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units determining whether an impairment occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit which is estimated using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the incomebased valuation method utilizes a discounted cash flow model which requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industryspecific market conditions each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis within the discounted cash flow models the company uses a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital but adjusted for inherent business risks and an appropriate terminal growth factor the marketbased valuation performed for each reporting unit includes an analysis consisting of marketadjusted multiples based on key data points for guideline public companies we also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulting from these procedures to our overall market capitalization 

at december 31 2020 the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its six reporting units the results of this test indicated the fair value substantially exceeded carrying value for all reporting units we continually monitor our reporting units for impairment indicators and update assumptions used in the most recent calculation of a reporting units fair value as appropriate we did not identify any events or circumstances during 2021 that required performance of an interim impairment test 

longlived assets held for use which primarily includes finitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value the longterm nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test during 2021 the company did not record any material impairment related to longlived assets 

pensions  the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the companys defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis this determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate longterm rate of return on plan assets increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements 

for the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan a 50 basis point change in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have an 18 million increase in annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by 27 million as of june 30 2021 707 million of past years net actuarial losses related to the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future these losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future any actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization further information on pensions is provided in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes  significant judgment is required in determining the companys income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities factors considered by the company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse the company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements further information on income taxes is provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

loss contingencies  the company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims product liability and litigation reserves establishing loss accruals for these matters requires managements estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization we review these loss accruals periodically and make adjustments to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  

the company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and nonderivative financial instruments including forward exchange contracts costless collar contracts crosscurrency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges the derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and we do not anticipate any material nonperformance by any of the counterparties the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through the consolidated statement of income derivatives that are designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings for crosscurrency swaps measured using the spot method the periodic interest settlements are recognized directly in earnings through interest expense the translation of the foreign denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated 

the companys debt portfolio contains variable rate debt inherently exposing the company to interest rate risk the companys objective is to maintain a 6040 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in nearterm interest rates at june 30 2021 our debt portfolio did not include any variable rate debt however a 100 basis point increase in nearterm interest rates would increase annual interest expense on weighted average commercial paper balances during 2021 by approximately 5 million 

as discussed elsewhere in this report the covid19 pandemic is having and likely will continue to have an adverse effect on our business and its future impacts remain unpredictable as we cannot anticipate the ultimate duration or scope of the covid19 pandemic the ultimate financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material

environmental regulation 

certain of our operations require the use and handling of hazardous materials and as a result the company is subject to united states federal state and local laws and regulations as well as nonus laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and regulate the discharge of materials into the environment these laws impose penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs property damage and personal injury resulting from past and current spills disposals or other releases of or exposures to hazardous materials among other environmental laws we are subject to the united states federal superfund law under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list 

as of june 30 2020  parker was involved in environmental remediation at various us and nonus manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by us and as a potentially responsible party along with other companies at offsite waste disposal facilities and regional sites 

we believe that our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the company compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management efforts and expenditures by the company compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past and we believe will not have in the future a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

energy matters and sources and availability of raw materials

 item 1a  risk factors  

the following risk factors identify what we believe to be the risks that could materially adversely affect our financial andor operational performance these risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic along with the response to the pandemic by governmental and other actors has disrupted our operations and is expected to continue to negatively impact our operations in the future which impact may be material we have experienced and may continue to experience mandatory and voluntary facility closures in certain jurisdictions in which we operate furthermore several of our customers temporarily suspended their operations and we have experienced less demand for our products disruptions to our customers in the aerospace industry which is facing the consequences of travel 

restrictions and severely diminished demand have been and are expected to continue to be especially challenging additionally the covid19 outbreak has and could further disrupt our supply chain facility closures or other restrictions as well as supply chain disruptions could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff supply or otherwise maintain our operations moreover because certain of our employees have transitioned to working from home we may be subject to increased vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks we have modified and may further modify our business practices in response to the risks and negative impacts associated with the covid19 pandemic however there can be no assurance that these measures will be temporary or successful 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate duration severity and disruption to our business customers and supply chain and the related financial impact to us cannot be accurately forecasted at this time should such disruption continue for an extended period the adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition could be more severe than previously anticipated additionally continued weak economic conditions generally could result in impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets furthermore future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks discussed above 

risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions may harm our business and make it difficult to project longterm performance 

our business is sensitive to global macroeconomic conditions future macroeconomic downturns may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as our distributors customers and suppliers and on activity in many of the industries and markets we serve among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing and other endmarket activity global pandemics currency exchange rates air travel trends difficulties entering new markets tariffs and governmental trade and monetary policies and general economic conditions such as inflation deflation interest rates and credit availability these factors may among other things negatively impact our level of purchases capital expenditures and creditworthiness as well as our distributors customers and suppliers and therefore the company’s revenues operating profits margins and order rates 

we cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions and government policies as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond our control if these conditions deteriorate or remain at depressed levels for extended periods however our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

as a global business we are exposed to economic political and other risks in different countries in which we operate which could materially reduce our sales profitability or cash flows or materially increase our liabilities 

our net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 37 percent in 2020  39 percent in 2019 and 41 percent in 2018  in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states the company expects net sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales our nonus operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing our domestic operations including 

 if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally the risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint ventures and risks relating to the integration of acquired companies including risks related to the integration of clarcor inc clarcor lord corporation lord and exotic metals forming company exotic 

we expect to continue our strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services and entering into joint ventures which we believe will enhance our operations and profitability however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities or that we will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms furthermore there are no assurances that we will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities if we are unable to avoid these risks our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

in addition we may not be able to integrate successfully any businesses that we purchase into our existing business and it is possible that any acquired businesses or joint ventures may not be profitable for example we have devoted significant management attention and resources to integrating the business and operations of clarcor lord and exotic we may encounter or have encountered the following difficulties during the integration process 

 the successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures also depend on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs if we are unable to avoid these risks our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our results may be adversely affected if expanded operations from the acquisition of clarcor lord and exotic are not effectively managed 

our recent acquisitions have greatly expanded the size and complexity of our business our future success depends in part on the ability to manage this expanded business which may pose or has posed substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of the expanded global operations and new manufacturing processes and products and the associated costs and complexity there can be no assurance of successful management of these matters or that we will realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions 

the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes 

we regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies we also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs the company commits significant resources to identify develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction if we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all 

increased cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business some of which are managed by third parties the security and functionality of these information technology systems and the processing of data by these systems are critical to our business operations if these systems or any part of the systems are damaged intruded upon attacked shutdown or cease to function properly whether by planned upgrades force majeure telecommunications failures hardware or software breakins or viruses or other cybersecurity incidents and we suffer any resulting interruption in our ability to manage and operate our business or if our products are affected our results of operations and financial condition 

could be materially adversely affected as a result of the covid19 pandemic certain of our employees have transitioned to working from home which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks in addition to existing risks any adoption or deployment of new technologies via acquisitions or internal initiatives may increase our exposure to risks breaches or failures which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition furthermore the company may have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that may be subject to privacy and security laws regulations or other contractuallyimposed controls despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls material security breaches theft misplaced lost or corrupted data programming or employee errors andor malfeasance could lead to the compromise or improper use of such sensitive confidential or personal data or information resulting in possible negative consequences such as fines penalties loss of reputation competitiveness or customers or other negative consequences resulting in adverse impacts to our results of operations or financial condition 

changes in the demand for and supply of our products may adversely affect our financial results financial condition and cash flow 

demand for and supply of our products has been and may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which we cannot predict or control such factors include 

 if any of these factors occur the demand for and supply of our products could suffer which could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

the development of new products and technologies requires substantial investment and is required to remain competitive in the markets we serve if we are unable to successfully introduce new commercial products our profitability could be adversely affected 

the markets we serve are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources if we cannot develop or have difficulties or delays developing new and enhanced products and services or if we fail to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies our revenues may be materially reduced and our competitive position could be materially adversely affected in addition we may invest in research and development of products and services or in acquisitions or other investments that do not lead to significant revenue which could adversely affect our profitability 

price and supply fluctuations of the raw materials used in our production processes and by our suppliers of component parts could negatively impact our financial results 

our supply of raw materials could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing furthermore changes to united states and other countries tariff and importexport regulations have in the past and may in the future have a negative impact on the availability and pricing of raw materials prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect our results of operations and profit margins our efforts to manage these fluctuations by among other things passing along price increases to our customers may be subject to a time delay between the increased raw material prices and our ability to increase the price of our products or we may be unable to increase the prices of our products due to pricing pressure contract terms or other factors any such inability to manage fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

our suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts as a result we may not be able to increase our prices commensurately with our increased costs consequently our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

changes in the competitive environment in which we operate may eliminate any competitive advantages that we currently have which could adversely impact our business 

our operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global regional and local competitors which could adversely affect our results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure andor a decline in our margins or market shares to compete successfully we must excel in terms of product quality and innovation technological and engineering capability manufacturing and distribution capability delivery price competitiveness and customer experience 

litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings against the company could decrease our liquidity impair our financial condition and adversely affect our results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome including the outcome of any related appeals an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore as required by us generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to national and international laws and regulations such as the anticorruption laws of the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act relating to our business and our employees despite our policies procedures and compliance programs our internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations any such improper acts could damage the companys reputation subject us to civil or criminal judgments fines or penalties and could otherwise disrupt the companys business and as a result could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

further our operations are subject to certain antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the united states and europe these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements or practices are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we may also be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable accordingly any violation of these laws could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings cash flows and financial condition 

additional liabilities relating to changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various nonus jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions our future results of operation could be adversely affected by changes in effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws and judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in overall profitability changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or regulations in addition the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

due to the nature of our business and products we may be liable for damages based on product liability claims 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of our products and the products of thirdparty vendors that we use or resell significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms or that our insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential significant liabilities 

failure to protect our intellectual property and knowhow could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage and reduce our sales and profitability and the cost of protecting our intellectual property may be significant 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts we own a number of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks trade names and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services throughout the world and the operation of our business we also have exclusive and nonexclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others our intellectual property may be challenged stolen or otherwise infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with thirdparty owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms in addition the global nature of our business increases the risk that our intellectual property may be subject to infringement theft or other unauthorized use or disclosure by others in some cases our ability to protect our intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property rights or our inability to protect intellectual property and preserve associated intellectual property rights could lead to reputational harm andor adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations 

our indebtedness and restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could limit our operational and financial flexibility 

we have incurred significant indebtedness and may incur additional debt for acquisitions operations research and development and capital expenditures or for other reasons related to our overall capital deployment strategy our ability to make interest and scheduled principal payments and meet restrictive covenants could be adversely impacted by changes in the availability terms and cost of capital changes in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings or our outlook these changes could increase our cost of financing and limit our debt capacity thereby limiting our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities react to market conditions and meet operational and capital needs which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

we carry goodwill on our balance sheet which is subject to impairment testing and could subject us to significant noncash charges to earnings in the future if impairment occurs 

we have goodwill recorded on our balance sheet goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the second quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist factors that could indicate that our goodwill is impaired include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization lower than projected operating results and cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry declines in our stock price lower operating results and any decline in industry conditions in the future could increase the risk of impairment impairment testing incorporates our estimates of future operating results and cash flows estimates of allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units estimates of future growth rates and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used on estimated operating results and cash flows if we determine at a future time that further impairment exists it may result in a significant noncash charge to earnings and lower stockholders’ equity 

we may be required to make material expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and climate change regulations or incur additional liabilities under these laws and regulations 

our operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and as a result subject us to various us federal state and local laws and regulations as well as nonus laws designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment these laws impose penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills disposals or other releases of or the exposure to hazardous materials among other laws we are subject to the us federal superfund law under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list we could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws including the superfund law 

in addition increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions including regulation of such emissions through a capandtrade system globally increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change concerns could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw material costs until definitive regulations are adopted we are not able to predict how such regulations would affect our business operations or financial results 

we may be subject to other more stringent environmental laws in the future if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our liability for such benefits 

the funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets which are dependent on actual plan asset returns significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations 

the company absorbs a portion of healthcare costs for its employees if healthcare costs rise significantly and we continue to absorb the majority of these costs these increasing costs may adversely impact our future results of operations 

as a provider of products to the us government we are subject to additional risks related to future government spending as well as unusual performance conditions and enhanced compliance risks 

in addition to the risks identified herein doing business with the us government subjects us to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental acquisition regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform or other unsatisfactory performance under the applicable contract we are subject to government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government acquisition regulations if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts and we could be subject to fines or penalties associated with contract noncompliance or resulting from such investigations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

overview 

the company is a leading worldwide diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems providing precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile industrial and aerospace markets 

our order rates provide a nearterm perspective of the companys outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates the company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis the lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders we believe the leading economic indicators of these markets that have a correlation to the companys future order rates are as follows 

 a pmi above 50 indicates that the manufacturing activity specific to a region of the world in the mobile and industrial markets is expanding a pmi below 50 indicates the opposite recent pmi levels for some regions around the world were as follows 



  

global aircraft miles flown decreased by approximately 45 percent and global revenue passenger miles decreased by approximately 52 percent from their comparable 2019 levels the company anticipates that us department of defense spending with regard to appropriations and operations and maintenance for the us governments fiscal year 2020 will increase by approximately two percent from its fiscal 2019 level 

housing starts in june 2020 were approximately two percent lower than housing starts in march 2020 and approximately four percent lower than housing starts in june 2019  

during 2020 the world health organization declared the recent outbreak covid19 a pandemic given the unpredictable nature of covid19s impact on the global economy the statistics included above may not be reflective of recent or future activity 

we are actively monitoring the impact of the covid19 outbreak which has negatively impacted and we expect will continue to negatively impact our business and results of operations disruption within the aerospace industry which is facing the consequences of travel restrictions and considerably lower demand was significant and is expected to continue the ultimate extent to which our business and results of operations will be impacted by the outbreak will depend largely on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted at this time including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or mitigate its economic public health and other impacts 

we took immediate and aggressive action to minimize the spread of covid19 in our workplaces and are taking measures to preserve cash and reduce costs including but not limited to global salary reductions reduced work schedules elimination of discretionary spending targeted restructuring and limiting capital expenditures to safetyrelated issues and strategic investments at the same time we are appropriately addressing the ongoing needs of our business so that we may continue to serve our customers 

in the longterm we believe many opportunities for profitable growth are available the company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy water food environment defense life sciences infrastructure and transportation 

we believe we can meet our strategic objectives by 

 acquisitions will be considered from time to time to the extent there is a strong strategic fit while at the same time maintaining the company’s strong financial position during 2020 the company completed the lord and exotic acquisitions which are further discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

we continue to assess our existing businesses and may initiate efforts to divest businesses that are not considered to be a good longterm strategic fit for the company future business divestitures could have a negative effect on the company’s results of operations

consolidated statement of income 

the consolidated statement of income summarizes the companys operating performance the discussion below compares the operating performance in 2020 and 2019  



net sales in 2020 decreased from the 2019 amount due to lower volume in all segments partially offset by an increase in sales from acquisitions made within the last 12 months of 949 million the effect of currency rate changes decreased net sales in 2020 by approximately 167 million of which 152 million was attributable to the diversified industrial international operations 

gross profit margin calculated as net sales less cost of sales divided by net sales decreased slightly in 2020  lower volume and currentyear acquisitionrelated expenses of 69 million were partially offset by lower operating costs resulting from current and prioryear business realignment acquisition integration and simplification activities lower raw material costs and favorable product mix additionally cost of sales included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of 60 million in 2020 compared to 15 million in 2019  gross profit margin in 2020 benefited from a foreign currency transaction gain of 10 million compared to a loss of 6 million in 2019  

selling general and administrative expenses sga increased seven percent in 2020 primarily due to acquisitionrelated transaction costs of 119 million in the current year compared to 17 million in 2019 and higher intangible asset amortization expense related to the lord and exotic acquisitions sga also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of 38 million and 13 million in 2020 and 2019  respectively these expenses were partially offset by a net benefit associated with the companys deferred compensation plan and related investments additionally sga benefited from lower discretionary spending and wage and salary expense as a result of actions taken in response to the current business conditions resulting from the covid19 outbreak 

interest expense in 2020 increased due to a higher average interest rate and higher average debt outstanding 

other income expense net included the following 



gain loss on disposal of assets in 2020 and 2019 includes gains on the sale of real estate of 12 million and 11 million respectively with the remainder relating to net losses on divestitures and asset sales and writedowns 

effective tax rate in 2020 was lower than 2019 primarily due to favorable onetime adjustments that were recorded in the current year as a result of a favorable foreign audit settlement 

business segment information 

the business segment information presents sales and operating income on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the companys various businesses are managed for internal review and decisionmaking 

diversified industrial segment 



the diversified industrial segment operations experienced the following percentage changes in net sales 

the above presentation reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the diversified industrial segment reported in accordance with us gaap to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of acquisitions made within the prior four fiscal quarters as well as the effects of currency exchange rates a nongaap measure the effects of acquisitions and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period 

sales in 2020 for the diversified industrial north american operations decreased 52 percent from 2019  acquisitions increased sales by 408 million and the effect of currency exchange rates decreased sales by approximately 13 million excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes sales in 2020 for the diversified industrial north american operations decreased 110 percent from prioryear levels reflecting lower demand from distributors and end users in virtually all markets including the construction equipment cars and light truck heavyduty truck engines refrigeration and general industrial machinery markets this decrease was partially offset by an increase in enduser demand in the life sciences market 

sales in the diversified industrial international operations decreased 99 percent in 2020  acquisitions increased sales by approximately 203 million in 2020  the effect of currency rate changes decreased sales by 152 million reflecting the strengthening of the us dollar primarily against currencies in the eurozone countries china brazil and south korea excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes sales in 2020 for the diversified industrial international operations decreased 109 percent from 2019 levels primarily due to lower demand from distributors and end users in both the mobile and industrial markets during 2020 europe the asia pacific region and latin america accounted for approximately 68 percent 28 percent and four percent respectively of the decrease in sales 

within europe the decrease in sales was primarily due to lower demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment general industrial machinery machine tool heavyduty truck and cars and light truck markets 

within the asia pacific region the decrease in sales was primarily due to lower demand from distributors as well as end users in the construction equipment railroad equipment telecommunications and machine tool markets this decrease was partially offset by an increase in enduser demand in the semiconductor mining and engine markets 

the decrease in sales in latin america was primarily due to lower demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment farm and agricultural equipment and cars and light truck markets partially offset by an increase in enduser demand in the oil and gas market 

operating margins in 2020 decreased in both the diversified industrial north american and international operations primarily due to lower sales volume acquisitionrelated expenses higher intangible asset amortization expense and higher business realignment and acquisition integration costs these costs were partially offset by lower discretionary spending lower wage and salary expense favorable product mix lower raw material costs benefits from currentyear and prioryear business realignment and simplification actions and prioryear pricing actions 

the following business realignment and acquisition integration charges are included in diversified industrial north america and diversified industrial international operating income 



the business realignment charges consist primarily of severance and plant closure costs related to actions taken under the companys simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity which is being implemented by its operating units throughout the world currentyear acquisition integration charges relate to the lord acquisition prioryear acquisition integration charges relate to the 2017 acquisition of clarcor during 2020 business realignment charges also include permanent workforce reductions to address the impact of covid19 on our business the majority of the diversified industrial international business realignment and acquisition integration charges were incurred in europe we anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2020 will increase operating income for 2021 by approximately five percent in the diversified industrial north american operations and by approximately two percent in the diversified industrial international operations in 2021 we expect to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the diversified industrial segment these actions are expected to result in approximately 53 million in business realignment charges in 2021 however continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur 

the increase in diversified industrial segment backlog in 2020 was primarily due to the currentyear acquisition of lord partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in both the north american and international businesses within the international business this decrease in backlog was primarily related to shipments exceeding orders in both europe and latin america partially offset by orders exceeding shipments in the asia pacific region backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and in the case of blanket purchase orders only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale 

aerospace systems segment   



sales in 2020 were higher than the 2019 level primarily due to 338 million of sales from currentyear acquisitions and higher volume in the military oem and aftermarket businesses partially offset by lower volume in the commercial oem and aftermarket businesses 

operating margin decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower sales volume in the commercial oem and aftermarket businesses unfavorable product mix acquisitionrelated expenses higher intangible asset amortization expense and currentyear business realignment and acquisition integration charges of 24 million the halt in production of the boeing 737 max also contributed to lower operating margin during 2020 these expenses were partially offset by lower engineering development expenses lower discretionary spending and savings from the currentyear business realignment and acquisition integration actions 

as a result of the disruption in the aerospace industry due to the covid19 pandemic we expect to continue to take the actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the aerospace systems segment these actions are expected to result in approximately 12 million of business realignment charges in 2021 however continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur we anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2020 will increase operating income for 2021 by approximately 13 percent 

the increase in backlog in 2020 was primarily due to the addition of exotic backlog in the current year and orders exceeding shipments in the military oem and aftermarket businesses partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the commercial oem and aftermarket businesses backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and in the case of blanket purchase orders only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale 

corporate general  administrative expenses 



corporate general and administrative expenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to a net benefit related to the companys deferred compensation plan and related investments additionally corporate general and administrative expenses benefited from lower discretionary spending and wage and salary expense as a result of actions taken in response to the current business conditions resulting from the covid19 outbreak 

other expense in the business segment information 



foreign currency transaction primarily relates to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions acquisition expenses relate to the acquisitions of lord and exotic

dividends have been paid for 280 consecutive quarters including a yearly increase in dividends for the last 64 years the current annual dividend rate is 352 per common share 

our goal is to maintain a strong investmentgrade credit profile the rating agencies periodically update our credit ratings as events occur at june 30 2020  the longterm credit ratings assigned to the companys senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the company were as follows 



during 2020 we have taken several meaningful measures to strengthen our liquidity position in light of the covid19 pandemic including limiting capital expenditures to safetyrelated issues and strategic investments the suspension of our share repurchase program and other cost reduction efforts although we cannot reasonably estimate the duration of the pandemic or its impact on our business we believe these measures as well as access to committed credit under our credit agreement position the company well to manage through the current economic uncertainty and capitalize on our position as the global leader in motion and control technologies as the economy recovers 

during 2020 the company amended and extended its existing multicurrency credit agreement increasing its capacity to 2500 million as of june 30 2020  the company had 1777 million available for borrowing under the credit agreement the credit agreement expires in september 2024 however the company has the right to request a oneyear extension of the expiration date on an annual basis which request may result in changes to the current terms and conditions of the credit agreement advances from the credit agreement can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and for the refinancing of existing indebtedness the credit agreement requires the payment of an annual facility fee the amount of which is dependent upon the company’s credit ratings although a lowering of the company’s credit ratings would increase the cost of future debt it would not limit the company’s ability to use the credit agreement nor would it accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

the company is currently authorized to sell up to 2500 million of shortterm commercial paper notes there were 724 million outstanding commercial paper notes as of june 30 2020  and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the last quarter of 2020 was 1089 million 

the company’s credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt securities contain various covenants the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit agreements for future borrowings or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures based on the company’s rating level at june 30 2020  the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of debt to debtshareholders equity cannot exceed 065 to 10 at june 30 2020  the companys debt to debtshareholders equity ratio was 058 to 10 we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit agreement and indentures 

contractual obligations  the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest for uncertain tax positions was 101 million at june 30 2020  payment of these obligations would result from settlements with worldwide taxing authorities due to the difficulty in determining the timing of the settlements these obligations are not included in the following summary of the companys fixed contractual obligations references to notes are to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment 

revenue recognition  revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations which are distinct goods or services within the contract is transferred to the customer control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services a majority of our revenues are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment however a portion of our revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced or if the product has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment 

for contracts where revenue is recognized over time we use the costtocost efforts expended or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract including length of production time the estimation of these costs and efforts expended requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved adjustments to these estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues 

when there are multiple performance obligations within a contract the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price the primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer 

we consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period these estimates are based on historical experience anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value our six reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units determining whether an impairment occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit which is 

estimated using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the incomebased valuation method utilizes a discounted cash flow model which requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industryspecific market conditions each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis within the discounted cash flow models the company uses a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital but adjusted for inherent business risks and an appropriate terminal growth factor the marketbased valuation performed for each reporting unit includes an analysis consisting of marketadjusted multiples based on key data points for guideline public companies we also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulting from these procedures to our overall market capitalization 

at december 31 2019 the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its six reporting units the results of this test indicated the fair value substantially exceeded carrying value for all reporting units we continually monitor our reporting units for impairment indicators and update assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate we did not identify any events or circumstances during 2020 that required performance of an interim impairment test however the effects of covid19 on the global economy including further market disruption lack of economic recovery or lower than anticipated customer demand may require the performance of additional goodwill impairment tests and the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value 

longlived assets held for use which primarily includes finitelived intangible assets and plant and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value the longterm nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test during 2020  the company did not record any material impairment related to longlived assets 

pensions  the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the companys defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis this determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate longterm rate of return on plan assets increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements 

for the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan a 50 basis point change in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a 17 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by 28 million as of june 30 2020  1456 million of past years net actuarial losses related to the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future these losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future any actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization further information on pensions is provided in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes  significant judgment is required in determining the companys income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities factors considered by the company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse the company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements further information on income taxes is provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

loss contingencies  the company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims product liability and litigation reserves establishing loss accruals for these matters requires managements estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization we review these loss accruals periodically and make adjustments to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

recently issued accounting pronouncements are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  

the company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and nonderivative financial instruments including forward exchange contracts costless collar contracts crosscurrency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges the derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and we do not anticipate any material nonperformance by any of the counterparties the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through the consolidated statement of income derivatives that are designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings for crosscurrency swaps measured using the spot method the periodic interest settlements are recognized directly in earnings through interest expense the translation of the foreign denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated 

the companys debt portfolio contains variable rate debt inherently exposing the company to interest rate risk the companys objective is to maintain a 6040 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in nearterm interest rates a 100 basis point increase in nearterm interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt existing at june 30 2020 by approximately 24 million  

as discussed elsewhere in this report the recent outbreak of covid19 has negatively impacted and we expect it to continue to negatively impact our business and results of operations as we cannot predict the ultimate duration or scope of the covid19 pandemic the ultimate negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material

competition 

parker operates in highly competitive markets and industries we offer our products over numerous varied markets through our divisions operating in 50 countries our global scope means that we have hundreds of competitors across our various markets and product offerings our competitors include us and nonus companies these competitors and the degree of competition vary widely by product lines end markets geographic scope andor geographic locations although each of our segments has numerous competitors given our market and product breadth no single competitor competes with the company with respect to all the products we manufacture and sell 

in the diversified industrial segment parker competes on the basis of product quality and innovation customer service manufacturing and distribution capability and price competitiveness we believe that we are one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for our most significant diversified industrial segment products we have comprehensive motion and control packages for the broadest systems capabilities while our primary global competitors include bosch rexroth ag danaher corporation danfoss as donaldson company inc eaton corporation plc emerson climate technologies inc emersonasco festo ag  co freudenbergnok gates corporation iminorgren smc corporation swagelok company and trelleborg ab none of these businesses compete with every group or product in our diversified industrial segment 

in the aerospace systems segment we have developed alliances with key customers based on our advanced technological and engineering capabilities superior performance in quality delivery and service and price competitiveness this has enabled us to obtain significant original equipment business on new aircraft programs for our systems and components as well as the followon repair and replacement business for these programs further the aerospace systems segment utilizes lowcost manufacturing techniques and best cost region strategies to achieve a lower cost producer status although we believe that we are one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for our most significant aerospace systems segment products primary global competitors for these products include eaton corporation plc honeywell international inc moog inc triumph group inc utc collins aerospace woodward inc and safran sa 

we believe that our platform utilizing eight core technologies which consist of electromechanical filtration fluid handling hydraulics pneumatics process control refrigeration and sealing and shielding is a positive factor in our ability to compete effectively with both large and small competitors for both of our segments we believe that the following factors also contribute to our ability to compete effectively 

 patents trademarks licenses 

we own a number of patents trademarks copyrights and licenses related to our products we also have exclusive and nonexclusive rights to use patents trademarks and copyrights owned by others in addition patent and trademark applications are pending although there can be no assurance that further patents and trademarks will be issued we do not depend on any single patent trademark copyright or license or group of patents trademarks copyrights or licenses to any material extent

environmental regulation 

certain of our operations require the use and handling of hazardous materials and as a result the company is subject to united states federal state and local laws and regulations as well as nonus laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and regulate the discharge of materials into the environment these laws impose penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs property damage and personal injury resulting from past and current spills disposals or other releases of or exposures to hazardous materials among other environmental laws we are subject to the united states federal superfund law under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list 

as of june 30 2019  parker was involved in environmental remediation at various us and nonus manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by us and as a potentially responsible party along with other companies at offsite waste disposal facilities and regional sites 

we believe that our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the company compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management efforts and expenditures by the company compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past and we believe will not have in the future a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

our reserve for environmental matters is discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference 

energy matters and sources and availability of raw materials 

our primary energy source for both of our business segments is electric power while we cannot predict future costs of electric power the primary source for production of the required electric power is expected to be coal and natural gas from coal and natural gas reserves available to electric utilities we are subject to governmental regulations in regard to energy supplies in the united states and elsewhere to date we have not experienced any significant disruptions of our operations due to energy curtailments 

we primarily use steel brass copper aluminum nickel rubber and thermoplastic materials and chemicals as the principal raw materials in our products we expect these materials to be available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements 

employees 

we employ approximately 55610 persons as of june 30 2019  of whom approximately 28500 were employed by foreign subsidiaries

 item 1a  risk factors  

the following risk factors identify what we believe to be the risks that could materially adversely affect our financial andor operational performance these risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions may harm our business and make it difficult to project longterm performance 

our business is sensitive to global macroeconomic conditions future macroeconomic downturns may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as our distributors customers and suppliers and on activity in many of the industries and markets we serve among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing and other endmarket activity currency exchange rates air travel trends difficulties entering new markets tariffs and governmental trade and monetary policies and general economic conditions such as inflation deflation interest rates and credit availability these factors may among other things negatively impact our level of purchases capital expenditures and creditworthiness as well as our distributors customers and suppliers and therefore the company’s revenues operating profits margins and order rates 

we cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions and government policies as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond our control if these conditions deteriorate or remain at depressed levels for extended periods however our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

as a global business we are exposed to economic political and other risks in different countries in which we operate which could materially reduce our sales profitability or cash flows or materially increase our liabilities 

our net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 39 in 2019  41 in 2018 and 40 in 2017  in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states the company expects net sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales our nonus operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing our domestic operations including 

 if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally the risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint ventures and risks relating to the integration of acquired companies including risks related to the integration of clarcor inc clarcor and the proposed acquisitions of lord and exotic 

we expect to continue our strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services and entering into joint ventures which we believe will enhance our operations and profitability however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities or that we will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms furthermore there are no assurances that we will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities if we are unable to avoid these risks our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

for example although we expect to realize certain benefits as a result of our proposed acquisitions of lord and exotic there is the possibility that we may not complete these proposed acquisitions or that following our acquisitions of lord and exotic we may be unable to successfully integrate those businesses in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions or to do so within the intended timeframe uncertainties associated with our proposed acquisitions of lord and exotic may also cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect our future business operations and financial results 

the risks and uncertainties of our proposed acquisitions of lord and exotic include among others 

 

in addition we may not be able to integrate successfully any businesses that we purchase into our existing business and it is possible that any acquired businesses or joint ventures may not be profitable for example we have devoted significant management attention and resources to integrating the business and operations of clarcor we may encounter or have encountered the following difficulties during the integration process of clarcor 

 the successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures also depend on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs if we are unable to avoid these risks our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our results may be adversely affected if expanded operations from the acquisition of clarcor or the proposed acquisitions of lord and exotic are not effectively managed 

our acquisition of clarcor greatly expanded the size and complexity of our business the proposed acquisitions of lord and exotic would further expand the size and complexity of our business our future success depends in part on the ability to manage this expanded business which may pose or has posed substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of the expanded global operations and new manufacturing processes and products and the associated costs and complexity there can be no assurance of successful management of these matters or that we will realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of clarcor or the proposed acquisitions of lord and exotic 

the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes 

we regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies we also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs the company commits significant resources to identify develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction if we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all 

increased cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business some of which are managed by third parties the security and functionality of these information technology systems and the processing of data by these systems are critical to our business operations if these systems or any part of the systems are damaged intruded upon attacked shutdown or cease to function properly whether by planned upgrades force majeure telecommunications failures hardware or software breakins or viruses or other cybersecurity incidents and we suffer any resulting interruption in our ability to manage and operate our business or if our products are effected our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition to existing risks any adoption or deployment of new technologies via acquisitions or internal initiatives may increase our exposure to risks breaches or failures which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition furthermore the company may have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that may be subject to privacy and security laws regulations or other contractuallyimposed controls despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls material security breaches theft misplaced lost or corrupted data programming or employee errors andor malfeasance could lead to the compromise or improper use of such sensitive confidential or personal data or information resulting in possible negative consequences such as fines penalties loss of reputation competitiveness or customers or other negative consequences resulting in adverse impacts to our results of operations or financial condition 

changes in the demand for and supply of our products may adversely affect our financial results financial condition and cash flow 

demand for and supply of our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which we cannot predict or control such factors include 

 if any of these factors occur the demand for and supply of our products could suffer which could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

the development of new products and technologies requires substantial investment and is required to remain competitive in the markets we serve if we are unable to successfully introduce new commercial products our profitability could be adversely affected 

the markets we serve are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources if we cannot develop or have difficulties or delays developing new and enhanced products and services or if we fail to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies our revenues may be materially reduced and our competitive position could be materially adversely affected in addition we may invest in research and development of products and services or in acquisitions or other investments that do not lead to significant revenue which could adversely affect our profitability 

price and supply fluctuations of the raw materials used in our production processes and by our suppliers of component parts could negatively impact our financial results 

our supply of raw materials could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing furthermore recently implemented changes to united states and other countries tariff and importexport regulations may have a negative impact on the availability and pricing of raw materials prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect our results of operations and profit margins our efforts to manage these fluctuations by among other things passing along price increases to our customers may be subject to a time delay between the increased raw material prices and our ability to increase the price of our products or we may be unable to increase the prices of our products due to pricing pressure contract terms or other factors any such inability to manage fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

our suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts as a result we may not be able to increase our prices commensurately with our increased costs consequently our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

changes in the competitive environment in which we operate may eliminate any competitive advantages that we currently have which could adversely impact our business 

our operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global regional and local competitors which could adversely affect our results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure andor a decline in our margins or market shares to compete successfully we must excel in terms of product quality and innovation technological and engineering capability manufacturing and distribution capability delivery price competitiveness and customer experience 

litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings against the company could decrease our liquidity impair our financial condition and adversely affect our results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome including the outcome of any related appeals an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore as required by us generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to national and international laws and regulations such as the anticorruption laws of the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act relating to our business and our employees despite our policies procedures and compliance programs our internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations any such improper acts could damage the companys reputation subject us to civil or criminal judgments fines or penalties and could otherwise disrupt the companys business and as a result could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

further our operations are subject to certain antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the united states and europe these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements or practices are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we may also be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable accordingly any violation of these laws could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings cash flows and financial condition 

additional liabilities relating to changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow 

parker is subject to income taxes in the us and various nonus jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions our future results of operation could be adversely affected by changes in effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws and judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in overall profitability changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or regulations in addition the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

due to the nature of our business and products we may be liable for damages based on product liability claims 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of our products and the products of thirdparty vendors that we use or resell significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms or that our insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential significant liabilities 

failure to protect our intellectual property and knowhow could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage and reduce our sales and profitability and the cost of protecting our intellectual property may be significant 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts we own a number of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks trade names and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services throughout the world and the operation of our business we also have exclusive and nonexclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others our intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with thirdparty owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms in addition the global nature of our business increases the risk that our intellectual property may be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use or disclosure by others in some cases our ability to protect our intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property rights or our inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations 

our indebtedness and restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could limit our operational and financial flexibility 

we have incurred significant indebtedness and may incur additional debt for acquisitions operations research and development and capital expenditures our ability to make interest and scheduled principal payments and meet restrictive covenants could be adversely impacted by changes in the availability terms and cost of capital changes in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings or our outlook these changes could increase our cost of financing and limit our debt capacity thereby limiting our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities react to market conditions and meet operational and capital needs which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

we carry goodwill on our balance sheet which is subject to impairment testing and could subject us to significant noncash charges to earnings in the future if impairment occurs 

we have goodwill recorded on our balance sheet goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the second quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist factors that could indicate that our goodwill is impaired include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization lower than projected operating results and cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry declines in our stock price lower operating results and any decline in industry conditions in the future could increase the risk of impairment impairment testing incorporates our estimates of future operating results and cash flows estimates of allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units estimates of future growth rates and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used on estimated operating results and cash flows if we determine at a future time that further impairment exists it may result in a significant noncash charge to earnings and lower stockholders’ equity 

we may be required to make material expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and climate change regulations or incur additional liabilities under these laws and regulations 

our operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and as a result subject us to various us federal state and local laws and regulations as well as nonus laws designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment these laws impose penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills disposals or other releases of or the exposure to hazardous materials among other laws we are subject to the us federal superfund law under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list we could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws including the superfund law 

in addition increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions including regulation of such emissions through a capandtrade system globally increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change concerns could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw material costs until definitive regulations are adopted we are not able to predict how such regulations would affect our business operations or financial results 

we may be subject to other more stringent environmental laws in the future if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our liability for such benefits 

the funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets which are dependent on actual plan asset returns significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations 

the company absorbs a portion of healthcare costs for its employees if healthcare costs rise significantly and we continue to absorb the majority of these costs these increasing costs may adversely impact our future results of operations 

as a provider of products to the us government we are subject to additional risks related to future government spending as well as unusual performance conditions and enhanced compliance risks 

in addition to the risks identified herein doing business with the us government subjects us to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental acquisition regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform or other unsatisfactory performance under the applicable contract we are subject to government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government acquisition regulations if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts and we could be subject to fines or penalties associated with contract noncompliance or resulting from such investigations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

overview 

the company is a leading worldwide diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems providing precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile industrial and aerospace markets 

our order rates provide a nearterm perspective of the companys outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates the company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis the lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders we believe the leading economic indicators of these markets that have a correlation to the companys future order rates are as follows 

 a pmi above 50 indicates that the manufacturing activity specific to a region of the world in the mobile and industrial markets is expanding a pmi below 50 indicates the opposite recent pmi levels for some regions around the world were as follows 



  

global aircraft miles flown increased by approximately four percent and global revenue passenger miles increased approximately five percent from their comparable 2018 levels the company anticipates that us department of defense spending with regards to appropriations and operations and maintenance for the us governments fiscal year 2019 will increase by approximately four percent from its fiscal 2018 level 

  

housing starts in june 2019 were 10 percent higher than housing starts in march 2019 and six percent higher than housing starts in june 2018  

we believe many opportunities for profitable growth are available the company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy water food environment defense life sciences infrastructure and transportation 

we believe we can meet our strategic objectives by 



acquisitions will be considered from time to time to the extent there is a strong strategic fit while at the same time maintaining the company’s strong financial position in addition we will continue to assess our existing businesses and initiate efforts to divest businesses that are not considered to be a good longterm strategic fit for the company future business divestitures could have a negative effect on the company’s results of operations

net sales in 2019 increased slightly from the 2018 amount this change was a result of an increase in volume primarily in the aerospace systems segment partially offset by the effect of currency rate changes the effect of currency rate changes decreased net sales in 2019 by approximately 305 million of which 285 million was attributable to the diversified industrial international operations 

gross profit margin calculated as net sales less cost of sales divided by net sales increased in 2019 primarily due to higher margins in the aerospace systems segment driven by increased aftermarket and original equipment manufacturer oem volume and profitability and lower engineering development costs lower operating costs in the diversified industrial segment resulting from prioryear business realignment and acquisition integration activities and the companys simplification initiative also contributed to higher margins in 2019 foreign currency transaction loss included in cost of sales for 2019 and 2018 was 59 million and 73 million  respectively included in cost of sales in 2019 and 2018 were business realignment charges of 147 million and 449 million  respectively 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 59 percent in 2019 primarily due to the benefits from prioryear business realignment and acquisition integration activities and the companys simplification initiative lower amortization expense and lower incentive compensation these benefits were partially offset by an increase in acquisitionrelated expenses and higher net expense associated with the companys deferred compensation program and related investments included in selling general and administrative expenses in 2019 and 2018 were business realignment charges of 132 million and 368 million  respectively

the decrease in total diversified industrial segment backlog in 2019 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders in both the north american and international businesses with each business accounting for 50 percent of the change within the diversified industrial international business the decrease in backlog was split evenly between europe and the asia pacific region backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and in the case of blanket purchase orders only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale 

aerospace systems segment 

  



sales in 2019 were higher than the 2018 level primarily due to higher volume in the commercial and military aftermarket businesses as well as in the commercial and military original equipment manufacturer oem businesses 

the higher margin in 2019 was primarily due to a favorable product mix resulting from higher aftermarket and oem volume and profitability higher joint venture earnings lower engineering development and the absence of business realignment expenses in the current year 

the increase in backlog in 2019 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the military oem and aftermarket businesses and in the commercial aftermarket business partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the commercial oem business backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and in the case of blanket purchase orders only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale 

for 2020 sales are expected to increase between 30 percent and 56 percent from the 2019 level and operating margins are expected to range from 204 percent to 210 percent a higher concentration of commercial oem volume in future product mix and higher than expected new product development costs could result in lower margins 

corporate general and administrative expenses were 195 million in 2019 compared to 201 million in 2018 as a percent of sales corporate general and administrative expenses in both 2019 and 2018 were 14 percent the lower expense in 2019 is primarily due to lower incentive compensation partially offset by higher net expense associated with the companys deferred compensation program and related investments

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment 

revenue recognition  revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations which are distinct goods or services within the contract is transferred to the customer control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services a majority of the company’s revenues are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment however a portion of the company’s revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as the company performs work under a contract if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and the company has a contractual right to payment 

for contracts where revenue is recognized over time the company uses the costtocost efforts expended or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract including length of production time the estimation of these costs and efforts expended requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved adjustments to these estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues 

when there are multiple performance obligations within a contract the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price the primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer 

the company considers the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period these estimates are based on historical experience anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and the company’s best judgment at the time 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value for the company reporting units are equivalent to its operating segments as quoted market prices are not available for the reporting units determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit which was estimated using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the incomebased valuation method utilized a discounted cash flow model which required several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industryspecific market conditions each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis within the discounted cash flow models the company also used a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital but adjusted for inherent business risks and an appropriate terminal growth factor the marketbased valuation method included an analysis for each reporting unit consisting of marketadjusted multiples based on key data points for guideline public companies the company also reconciled the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units resulting from these procedures to its overall market capitalization 

the results of the companys 2019 annual goodwill impairment test performed as of december 31 2018 indicated that no goodwill impairment existed the company continually monitors its reporting units for impairment indicators and updates assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate the company is unaware of any current market trends that are contrary to the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of any of its reporting units if actual experience is not consistent with the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units it is possible that the company may need to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests and the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value 

longlived assets held for use which primarily includes finitelived intangible assets and plant and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value the longterm nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test during 2019  the company did not record any material impairment related to longlived assets 

pensions  the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the companys defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis this determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate longterm rate of return on plan assets increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements 

for the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan a 50 basis point change in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a 15 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by 23 million as of june 30 2019  1064 million of past years net actuarial losses related to the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future these losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future any actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization further information on pensions is provided in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes  significant judgment is required in determining the companys income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities factors considered by the company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse the company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements further information on income taxes is provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

loss contingencies  the company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims product liability and litigation reserves establishing loss accruals for these matters requires managements estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization these loss accruals are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances

net sales   in 2018 were 189 percent higher than 2017 the increase in net sales in 2018 was a result of an increase in volume in both the diversified industrial north american and diversified industrial international operations and acquisitions completed during 2017 which contributed approximately 970 million to currentyear incremental net sales the effect of currency rate changes increased net sales in 2018 by approximately 295 million of which 270 million was attributable to the diversified industrial international operations net sales   in 2017 were 59 percent higher than 2016 the increase in net sales in 2017 was primarily a result of acquisitions made in 2017 which contributed approximately 558 million in sales in 2017 and an increase in volume in both the diversified industrial international operations and the aerospace systems segment partially offset by the effect of currency rate changes which decreased net sales in 2017 by approximately 84 million 

gross profit margin calculated as net sales less cost of sales divided by net sales increased in 2018 primarily due to higher margins in the aerospace systems segment resulting from a favorable product mix all segments benefited from lower operating expenses related to simplification and realignment efforts these benefits were partially offset by unfavorable product mix unfavorable raw material prices and inefficiencies created by manufacturing facility consolidations which contributed to lower margins in the diversified industrial north american and diversified industrial international operations during 2018 gross profit margin increased in 2017 primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from the companys simplification initiative and other restructuring activities primarily experienced in the diversified industrial segment partially offset by lower margins in the aerospace systems segment foreign currency transaction loss relating to cash marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions included in cost of sales for 2018 2017 and 2016 was 73 million 81 million and 227 million respectively pension cost included in cost of sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 was 861 million 1350 million and 1724 million respectively included in cost of sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 were business realignment charges of 449 million  359 million  and 762 million  respectively

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment 

revenue recognition   substantially all of the diversified industrial segment revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured which is generally at the time the product is shipped the aerospace systems segment recognizes revenues primarily using the percentageofcompletion method and the extent of progress toward completion is primarily measured using the unitsofdelivery method the company estimates costs to complete longterm contracts for purposes of evaluating and establishing contract reserves the estimation of these costs requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved adjustments to cost estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues 

impairment of goodwill   and longlived assets  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value for the company a reporting unit is one level below the operating segment level determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit which the company has consistently estimated using primarily a discounted cash flow model the company believes that the use of a discounted cash flow model results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting units fair value since the market value for a reporting unit is not readily available the discounted cash flow analysis requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry specific market conditions each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis the company has consistently used a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital adjusted for inherent business risks and an appropriate terminal growth factor the company also reconciles the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units as derived from the discounted cash flow analysis to the companys overall market capitalization 

the results of the companys 2018 annual goodwill impairment test performed as of december 31 2017 indicated that no goodwill impairment existed however certain reporting units within the diversified industrial segment had estimated fair values that the company determined from a quantitative and qualitative perspective were not significantly in excess of their carrying values for these reporting units the sales growth assumptions had the most significant influence on the estimation of fair value the key uncertainties in these sales growth assumptions include endmarket growth the ability to secure business with new customers and new product development the company continually monitors its reporting units for impairment indicators and updates assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate the company is unaware of any current market trends that are contrary to the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of any of its reporting units if actual experience is not consistent with the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units it is possible that the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value resulting in the necessity to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests 

longlived assets held for use which primarily includes finitelived intangible assets and plant and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value the longterm nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test during 2018 there were no events or circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of the companys longlived assets held for use were not recoverable 

pensions   the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the companys defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis this determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate longterm rate of return on plan assets increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements beginning in 2017 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs from the singleweighted average discount rate to spot yield curve approach the change does not affect the measurement of the companys benefit obligations the new method provides a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates and was accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2017 annual net periodic pension expense in 2017 was lower by approximately 30 million compared to the previous method annual net periodic postretirement cost was not materially different 

for the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan a 50 basis point change in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a 14 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by 17 million as of june 30 2018 841 million of past years net actuarial losses related to the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future these losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization further information on pensions is provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment 

revenue recognition   substantially all of the diversified industrial segment revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured which is generally at the time the product is shipped the aerospace systems segment recognizes revenues primarily using the percentageofcompletion method and the extent of progress toward completion is primarily measured using the unitsofdelivery method the company estimates costs to complete longterm contracts for purposes of evaluating and establishing contract reserves the estimation of these costs requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved adjustments to cost estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues 

impairment of goodwill   and longlived assets  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value for the company a reporting unit is one level below the operating segment level determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit which the company has consistently estimated using primarily a discounted cash flow model the company believes that the use of a discounted cash flow model results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting units fair value since the market value for a reporting unit is not readily available the discounted cash flow analysis requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry specific market conditions each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis the company has consistently used a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital adjusted for inherent business risks and an appropriate terminal growth factor the company also reconciles the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units as derived from the discounted cash flow analysis to the companys overall market capitalization 

the results of the companys 2017 annual goodwill impairment test performed as of december 31 2016 indicated that no goodwill impairment existed the company continually monitors its reporting units for impairment indicators and updates assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate the company is unaware of any current market trends that are contrary to the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of any of its reporting units if actual experience is not consistent with the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units especially assumptions regarding penetration into new markets and the recovery of the current economic environment it is possible that the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value resulting in the necessity to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests 

longlived assets held for use which primarily includes finitelived intangible assets and plant and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value the longterm nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test during 2017 there were no events or circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of the companys longlived assets held for use were not recoverable 

pensions   the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the companys defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis this determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate longterm rate of return on plan assets increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements beginning in 2017 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs the new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligations to 

relevant cash outflows previously these costs were determined using a singleweighted average discount rate the change does not affect the measurement of the companys benefit obligations the new method provides a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates and was accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2017 annual net periodic pension expense in 2017 was lower by approximately 30 million compared to the previous method annual net periodic postretirement cost was not materially different 

for the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan a 50 basis point change in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a 14 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by 26 million as of june 30 2017 1081 million of past years net actuarial losses related to the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future these losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the actuarial loss amortization further information on pensions is provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes   significant judgment is required in determining the companys income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities factors considered by the company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse the company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements further information on income taxes is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

loss contingencies   the company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims product liability and litigation reserves establishing loss accruals for these matters requires managements estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization these loss accruals are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances

 item 7a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   the company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and nonderivative financial instruments including forward exchange contracts costless collar contracts crosscurrency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges the derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and the company does not anticipate any material nonperformance by any of the counterparties the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k gains or losses on derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through the consolidated statement of income gains or losses on derivatives that are hedges are adjusted to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the translation of the foreign denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated 

the companys debt portfolio contains variable rate debt inherently exposing the company to interest rate risk the companys objective is to maintain a 6040 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in nearterm interest rates a 100 basis point increase in nearterm interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt existing at june 30 2017  by approximately 12 million

europe accounting for approximately 30 percent of the decrease the decrease in total diversified industrial segment backlog in 2015 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders in all regions backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and in the case of blanket purchase orders only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale

for 2017 sales are expected to increase between one percent and three percent from the 2016 level and operating margins are expected to range from 151 percent to 155 percent a higher concentration of commercial oem volume in future product mix and higher than expected new product development costs could result in lower margins

corporate assets decreased 125 percent in 2016 compared to a decrease of 108 percent from 2014 to 2015 the decrease in corporate assets in 2016 was primarily due to decreases in marketable securities and other investments nontrade and notes receivable cash and cash equivalents and the effect of currency rate fluctuations partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes the decrease in corporate assets in 2015 was primarily due to the effect of currency rate fluctuations and changes in cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and other investments nontrade and notes receivable deferred income taxes and other assets

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment 

revenue recognition   substantially all of the diversified industrial segment revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured which is generally at the time the product is shipped the aerospace systems segment recognizes revenues primarily using the percentageofcompletion method and the extent of progress toward completion is primarily measured using the unitsofdelivery method the company estimates costs to complete longterm contracts for purposes of evaluating and establishing contract reserves the estimation of these costs requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved adjustments to cost estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues 

impairment of goodwill   and longlived assets  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value for the company a reporting unit is one level below the operating segment level determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit which the company has consistently estimated using primarily a discounted cash flow model the company believes that the use of a discounted cash flow model 

results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting units fair value since the market value for a reporting unit is not readily available the discounted cash flow analysis requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry specific market conditions each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis the company has consistently used a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital adjusted for inherent business risks and an appropriate terminal growth factor the company also reconciles the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units as derived from the discounted cash flow analysis to the companys overall market capitalization 

the results of the companys 2016 annual goodwill impairment test performed as of december 31 2015 indicated that no goodwill impairment existed during 2014 the company made a decision to restructure and change the strategic direction of its worldwide energy products division epd the company calculated the fair value of epd using assumptions reflecting the companys current strategic direction for this reporting unit the results of which indicated that the carrying value of epd exceeded its fair value as a result the company estimated the implied fair value of epds goodwill which resulted in a noncash impairment charge of 140 million the fair value of epd was calculated using both a discounted cash flow analysis and estimated fair market values of comparable businesses 

the company continually monitors its reporting units for impairment indicators and updates assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate the company is unaware of any current market trends that are contrary to the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of any of its reporting units if actual experience is not consistent with the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units especially assumptions regarding penetration into new markets and the recovery of the current economic environment it is possible that the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value resulting in the necessity to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests 

longlived assets held for use which primarily includes finitelived intangible assets and plant and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value the longterm nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test during 2016 there were no events or circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of the companys longlived assets held for use were not recoverable during 2014 in connection with the goodwill impairment review discussed above the company determined certain intangible assets of epd primarily trademarks and customer lists and plant and equipment were impaired resulting in a noncash impairment charge of 49 million the fair value of epds intangible assets and plant and equipment were determined using the income approach for each asset 

pensions   the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the companys defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis this determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate longterm rate of return on plan assets increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements beginning in 2017 the company will change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs the new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligations to relevant cash outflows previously these costs were determined using a singleweighted average discount rate the change does not affect the measurement of the companys benefit obligations the new method provides a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates and will be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2017 annual net periodic pension expense in 2017 is expected to be lower by approximately 33 million compared to the previous method annual net periodic postretirement cost is not expected to be materially different 

for the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan a 50 basis point change in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a 12 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by 31 million as of june 30 2016 1535 million of past years net actuarial losses related to the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future these losses will generally be amortized over approximately eight years and will negatively affect earnings in the future actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the actuarial loss amortization further information on pensions is provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes   significant judgment is required in determining the companys income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities factors considered by the company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse the company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements further information on income taxes is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

loss contingencies   the company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims product liability and litigation reserves establishing loss accruals for these matters requires managements estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization these loss accruals are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances

 item 7a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   the company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and nonderivative financial instruments including forward exchange contracts costless collar contracts crosscurrency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges the derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and the company does not anticipate any material nonperformance by any of the counterparties the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k gains or losses on derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through the consolidated statement of income gains or losses on derivatives that are hedges are adjusted to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the translation of the foreign denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated 

the companys debt portfolio contains variable rate debt inherently exposing the company to interest rate risk the companys objective is to maintain a 6040 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in nearterm interest rates a 100 basis point increase in nearterm interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt existing at june 30 2016  by approximately 6 million

during the second half of fiscal 2010 the company began to see signs of an economic recovery throughout the worldwide economic downturn the company focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash the company’s win strategy initiatives relating to growth and margin improvement as well as the implementation of a number of business realignment initiatives including plant closures and general workforce reductions continue to help meet this objective there can be no assurance however that these or any other initiatives or contingency plans implemented by the company will be successful or that the company will have sufficient resources to manage the recovery if the economy rebounds more quickly than anticipated 

the company cannot predict if when or how much worldwide economic conditions will improve these conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the company’s control if these conditions deteriorate however the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

 11  

the company is subject to risks relating to its information technology systems 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate its business if these systems are damaged or cease to function properly and the company suffers any interruption in its ability to manage and operate its business the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

potential product liability risks exist from the products that the company sells 

the company’s businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors that the company uses or resells although the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities in the event of a claim against it a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations moreover even if the company maintains adequate insurance a successful claim could still have a material adverse effect on its financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

the company may be adversely affected by litigation or other regulatory proceedings 

the company is a defendant from time to time in litigation and regulatory proceedings relating to its business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings the company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings an unfavorable outcome could adversely impact the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

numerous factors may affect the demand for and supply of the company’s products including 

 

  

  

   

 12  

  

 if any of these factors occur the demand for and supply of the company’s products could suffer which would adversely affect its results of operations 

the raw materials used in the company’s production processes and by its suppliers of component parts are subject to price and supply fluctuations that could increase the costs of products and adversely affect our results of operations 

the company’s supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and profit margins although the company generally attempts to manage these fluctuations by among other things passing along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company’s ability to increase the price of its products or the company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure sales contracts or other factors 

the company’s suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts as a result the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs consequently the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the company may face various risks relating to acquisitions including limitations on its ability to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services that it believes will enhance its operations and profitability however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms in addition there is no assurance that the company will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities that the company will be able to integrate successfully any businesses that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses will be profitable the successful integration of new businesses depends on the company’s ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs if the company is unable to avoid these risks its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment

 13  

the company is subject to risks relating to its foreign operations 

the company’s net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 45 in fiscal 2010 44 in fiscal 2009 and 47 in fiscal 2008 in addition many of the company’s manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states the company expects net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales the company’s foreign operations are subject to risk in addition to those risks of its domestic operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

changes in the company’s tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by united states federal state and local tax authorities and by nonunited states authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

  

 14  

the obama administration has proposed legislation that would change how us multinational corporations are taxed on their foreign income if such legislation is enacted the company’s effective tax rate and in turn the company’s profitability could be materially impacted 

the company’s future growth is partly dependent on the development of new products and technologies 

the markets the company operates in are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services the company’s ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company’s competitive position 

the company’s future growth is partly dependent on the preservation of its intellectual property 

protecting the company’s intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns a number of patents trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and nonexclusive rights under patents owned by others the company’s intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with thirdparty owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms in addition the global nature of the company’s business could present increased risks that the company’s intellectual property will be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use outside of the united states in such case the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are undeveloped or do not recognize or protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the united states unauthorized use of the company’s intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company’s competitive position and results of operations 

the company may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations to which it is subject 

the company’s operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and as a result it is subject to various united states federal state and local laws and regulations as well as foreign laws designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment these laws impose penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills disposals or other releases of or the exposure to hazardous materials among other laws the company is subject to the united states federal “superfund” law under which it has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list the company could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws including the superfund law 

  

 15  

in addition increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to recent legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions including regulation of such emissions through a “capandtrade” system in the united states changes in or to regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change concerns could subject the company to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw material costs while such regulation appears likely in the united states until definitive regulations are adopted the company is not able to predict how such regulations would affect the company’s business operations or financial results 

the company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

the amount of expenses recorded for the company’s defined benefit pension plans is dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets which are dependent on actual plan asset returns significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase expenses and may adversely impact the company’s future results of operations 

the company does business with the united states government and as such is subject to government regulations 

in addition to the risks identified herein doing business with the united states government subjects the company to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for the company’s failure to perform under the applicable contract the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations

the company is subject to adverse changes in worldwide economic conditions and volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets 

the extended deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and the resulting volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the business results of operations and financial condition of the company and its distributors customers and suppliers and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which the company and its distributors customers and suppliers operate these effects have among other things negatively impacted the level of capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the company’s distributors customers and suppliers and therefore the company’s revenues operating profits and margins and order rates 

the company remains focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash through various initiatives including workforce reductions salary freezes and short work weeks there can be no assurance however that that these or any other initiatives or contingency plans implemented by the company to further control costs will be successful 

the company cannot predict the duration or severity of the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and the resulting volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets or if or when conditions will improve these conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the company’s control if these conditions continue for a significant period of time or further deteriorate however the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the company is subject to risks relating to its foreign operations 

in fiscal 2009 approximately 44 of the company’s net sales were derived from customers outside the united states in addition many of the company’s manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states the company expects net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales the company’s foreign operations are subject to risk in addition to those risks of its domestic operations including 

 

  

  

   

 10

the company operates in a highly competitive environment 

the company’s domestic and foreign operations are subject to significant competitive pressures to compete successfully the company’s industrial segment and climate  industrial controls segment must excel in terms of product quality and innovation customer service manufacturing and distribution capability and price competitiveness and its aerospace segment must excel on the basis of technological and engineering capability quality delivery and service and price competitiveness the financial resources of certain of the company’s competitors may put the company at a competitive disadvantage 

the raw materials used in the company’s production processes and by its suppliers of component parts are subject to price and supply fluctuations that could increase its costs of products and adversely affect its results of operations 

the company’s supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and profit margins although the company generally attempts to pass along increased raw 

  

 11  

material prices to its customers in the form of price increases there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company’s ability to increase the price of its products or the company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure or other factors 

the company’s suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts as a result the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs consequently the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected

increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

the amount of expenses recorded for the company’s defined benefit pension plans is dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets which are dependent on actual plan asset returns significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely impact the company’s future results of operations

the company’s domestic and foreign operations are subject to significant competitive pressures to compete successfully the company’s industrial segment and climate  industrial controls segment must excel in terms of product quality and innovation customer service manufacturing and distribution capability and price competitiveness and its aerospace segment must excel on the basis of technological and engineering capability quality delivery and service and price competitiveness the financial resources of certain of the company’s competitors may put the company at a competitive disadvantage

the raw materials used in the company’s production processes and by its suppliers of component parts are subject to price and supply fluctuations that could increase its costs of products and adversely affect its results of operations 

the company’s supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and profit margins although the company generally attempts to pass along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company’s ability to increase the price of its products or the company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure or other factors 

the company’s suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts as a result the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs consequently the company’s results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

the company may face limitations on its ability to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services that it believes will enhance its operations and profitability however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms 

in addition there is no assurance that the company will be able to integrate successfully any business that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses will be profitable the successful integration of new businesses depends on the company’s ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs if the company is unable to complete the integration of new businesses in a timely and effective manner its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

potential product liability risks exist from the products that the company sells 

the company’s businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors that it uses or resells although the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in the event of a claim against it a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations moreover even if it maintains adequate insurance a successful claim could still have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations

the company’s future growth is partly dependent on the development of new products and technologies 

the markets the company operates in are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services the company’s ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company’s competitive position 

the company’s future growth is partly dependent on the preservation of its intellectual property 

protecting the company’s intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns a number of patents trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and nonexclusive rights under patents owned by others the company’s intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with thirdparty owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms in addition the global nature of the company’s business could present increased risks that the company’s intellectual property will be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use outside of the united states in such case the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are undeveloped or do not recognize or protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the united states unauthorized use of the company’s intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company’s competitive position and results of operations 

the company may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations to which it is subject 

the company’s operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and as a result it is subject to various us federal state and local laws and regulations as well as foreign laws designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment these laws impose penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills disposals or other releases of or the exposure to hazardous materials among other laws the company is subject to the united states federal “superfund” law under which it has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list the company could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws including the superfund law 

the company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future compliance with these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

 10  

the company may be adversely affected by litigation or other regulatory proceedings 

the company is a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory proceedings relating to its business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings the company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings an unfavorable outcome could adversely impact the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

the company does business with the us government and as such is subject to government regulations 

in addition to normal business risks doing business with the united states government subjects the company to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for the company’s failure to perform under the applicable contract the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

changes in the company’s tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by united states federal state and local tax authorities and by nonunited states authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

the amount of expenses recorded for the company’s defined benefit pension plans is dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets which are dependent on actual plan asset returns significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely impact the company’s future results of operations

numerous factors may affect the demand for and supply of the company’s products including 

 

  

  

  

  

 if any of these factors occur the demand for and supply of the company’s products could suffer which would adversely affect its results of operations 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment 

the company’s domestic and foreign operations are subject to significant competitive pressures to compete successfully the company’s industrial segment and climate  industrial controls segment must excel in terms of product quality and innovation customer service manufacturing and distribution capability and price competitiveness and its aerospace segment must excel on the basis of technological and engineering capability quality delivery and service and price competitiveness the financial resources and performance of certain of the company’s competitors may put the company at a competitive disadvantage which would adversely affect its results of operations 

the company’s future growth is partly dependent on the development of new products and technologies and preservation of its intellectual property 

  

 8  

the markets the company operates in are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services the company’s ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially adversely affect the company’s competitive position 

protecting the company’s intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns a number of patents trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and nonexclusive rights under patents owned by others the company’s intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with thirdparty owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms unauthorized use of the company’s intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact the company’s competitive position and results of operations 

the raw materials used in the company’s production processes and by its suppliers of component parts are subject to price and supply fluctuations that could increase the company’s costs of products and adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

the company’s supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and profit margins while the company generally attempts to pass along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company’s ability to increase the price of its products or it may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure or other factors 

the company’s suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture their component parts in those circumstances the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

the company may face limitations on its ability to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services that it believes will enhance its operations and profitability however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms 

in addition no guarantee can be given that the company will be able to integrate successfully any business that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses will be profitable the successful integration of new businesses depends on the company’s ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs if the company is unable to complete the integration of new businesses 

  

 9  

in a timely manner its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

potential product liability risks exist from the products that the company sells 

the company’s businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors that it uses or resells the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance there can be no assurance however that the company will be able to maintain its product liability insurance on acceptable terms or that its product liability insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in the event of a claim against it a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations moreover even if it maintains adequate insurance any successful claim could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance 

the company may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations to which it is subject 

the company’s operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and as a result it is subject to various us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment these laws impose penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs property damage and personal injury resulting from past and current spills disposals or other releases of or the exposure to hazardous materials among other environmental laws the company is subject to the us federal “superfund” law under which it has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list the company could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws including the superfund law 

the company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company does business with the us government and as such is subject to increased government regulations 

in addition to normal business risks doing business with the us government subjects the company to increased risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for the company’s failure to perform under the applicable contract the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any 

  

 10  

such investigation it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

changes in the company’s tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities 

increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

the amount of expenses recorded for the company’s defined benefit pension plans is dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets which are dependent on actual plan asset returns significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations

the company is subject to risks relating to its foreign operations 

in fiscal year 2006 approximately 37 of the company’s net sales were derived from customers outside the united states in addition many of the company’s manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states the company expects net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales the company’s foreign operations are subject to risk in addition to those risks of its domestic operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 if the company is unable to manage successfully the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

demand for and supply of the company’s products may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which the company cannot predict or control which could adversely affect its results of operations 

numerous factors may affect the demand for and supply of the company’s products including 

 

  

  

  

  

 if any of these factors occur the demand for and supply of the company’s products could suffer which would adversely affect its results of operations 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment 

the company’s domestic and foreign operations are subject to significant competitive pressures to compete successfully the company’s industrial segment and climate and industrial controls segment must excel in terms of product quality and innovation customer service manufacturing and distribution capability and price competitiveness and its aerospace segment must excel on the basis of technological and engineering capability quality delivery and service and price competitiveness the financial resources and performance of certain of the company’s competitors may put the company at a competitive disadvantage which would adversely affect its results of operations 

the company’s future growth is partly dependent on the development of new products and technologies and preservation of its intellectual property 

the markets the company operates in are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services the company’s ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially adversely affect the company’s competitive position 

  

protecting the company’s intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns a number of patents trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and nonexclusive rights under patents owned by others the company’s intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with third party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms unauthorized use of the company’s intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact the company’s competitive position and results of operations 

the raw materials used in the company’s production processes and by its suppliers of component parts are subject to price and supply fluctuations that could increase the company’s costs of products and adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

the company’s supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and profit margins while the company generally attempts to pass along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company’s ability to increase the price of its products or it may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure or other factors 

the company’s suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture their component parts in those circumstances the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

the company may face limitations on its ability to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services that it believes will enhance its operations and profitability however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms 

in addition no guarantee can be given that the company will be able to integrate successfully any business that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses will be profitable the successful integration of new businesses depends on the company’s ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs if the company is unable to complete the integration of new businesses in a timely manner its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

potential product liability risks exist from the products that the company sells 

  

the company’s businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors that it uses or resells the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance there can be no assurance however that the company will be able to maintain its product liability insurance on acceptable terms or that its product liability insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in the event of a claim against it a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations moreover even if it maintains adequate insurance any successful claim could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance 

the company may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations to which it is subject 

the company’s operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and as a result it is subject to various us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment these laws impose penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs property damage and personal injury resulting from past and current spills disposals or other releases of or the exposure to hazardous materials among other environmental laws the company is subject to the us federal “superfund” law under which it has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites some of which are on the us environmental protection agency’s superfund priority list the company could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws including the superfund law 

the company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company does business with the us government and as such is subject to increased government regulations 

in addition to normal business risks doing business with the us government subjects the company to increased risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for the company’s failure to perform under the applicable contract the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

changes in the company’s tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability 

  

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities 

increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

the amount of expenses recorded for the company’s defined benefit pension plans is dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets which are dependent on actual plan asset returns significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations
