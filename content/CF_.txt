our commitment to a clean energy economy 

we are taking significant steps to support a global hydrogen and clean fuel economy through the production of green and blue ammonia since ammonia is one of the most efficient ways to transport and store hydrogen and is also a fuel in its own right we believe that the company as the world’s largest producer of ammonia with an unparalleled manufacturing and distribution network and deep technical expertise is uniquely positioned to fulfill anticipated demand for hydrogen and ammonia from green and blue sources our approach includes green ammonia production which refers to ammonia produced through a carbonfree process and blue ammonia production which relates to ammonia produced by conventional processes but with co 2 removed through carbon capture and sequestration ccs and other certified carbon abatement projects 

in october 2020 we announced an initial green ammonia project at our donaldsonville complex in april 2021 we signed an engineering and procurement contract with thyssenkrupp to supply a 20 mw alkaline water electrolysis plant to produce green hydrogen at our donaldsonville complex construction and installation which is being managed by us began in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is expected to finish in 2023 with an estimated total cost of approximately 100 million the cost of the project is expected to fit within our annual capital expenditure budgets we will integrate the green hydrogen generated by the electrolysis plant into existing ammonia synthesis loops to enable the production of approximately 20000 tons per year of green ammonia we believe that when completed in 2023 the donaldsonville green ammonia project will be the largest of its kind in north america 

in the third quarter of 2021 we signed a memorandum of understanding with mitsui  co inc mitsui that will guide us in a joint exploration of the development of blue ammonia projects in the united states the preliminary studies we are conducting with mitsui cover areas such as blue ammonia supply and supply chain infrastructure co 2 transportation and storage expected environmental impacts and blue ammonia economics and marketing opportunities in japan and in other countries 

we have also announced steps to produce blue ammonia from our ammonia production network in the fourth quarter of 2021 our board of directors authorized projects that will enable the annual production of up to 125 million tons of blue ammonia from our existing network starting in 2024 the projects will involve constructing units at our donaldsonville and yazoo city complexes that dehydrate and compress co 2  a process essential for co 2 transport via pipeline to sequestration sites management expects that once the units are in service and sequestration is initiated we could sequester up to 25 million tons of co 2 per year 2 million tons at donaldsonville and 500000 tons at yazoo city under current regulations the projects would be expected to qualify for tax credits under section 45q of the internal revenue code which provides a credit per tonne of co 2 sequestered 

construction of the units at the donaldsonville complex is expected to begin in 2022 and to be completed in 2024 with an estimated total cost of 200 million the yazoo city project will be timed to coincide with co 2 transport pipeline construction once started the project is expected to be completed in three years with an estimated total cost of 85 million in addition we are currently in advanced discussions with several parties regarding transportation and sequestration of co 2 from donaldsonville 

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as central farmers fertilizer company and were owned by a group of regional agriculture cooperatives for the first 59 years of our existence central farmers became cf industries in 1970 

originally established as a fertilizer brokerage company we expanded owning and operating fertilizer manufacturing and distribution facilities in the early 1950s with a principal objective of assured supply for our owners at various times in our history we manufactured andor distributed nitrogen phosphate and potash fertilizers 

we operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply for our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners’ equity interests in cf industries were canceled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock at the time of the ipo our assets consisted of one wholly owned nitrogen manufacturing facility 

cf industries holdings inc 

in louisiana united states a joint venture nitrogen manufacturing facility in alberta canada of which we owned 66 percent a phosphate mining and manufacturing operation in florida united states and distribution facilities throughout north america 

in april 2010 we acquired terra industries inc terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities an approximately 753 interest in terra nitrogen company lp tnclp and certain joint venture interests 

in march 2014 we exited our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was located in florida through a sale to the mosaic company for approximately 14 billion in cash as a result our company became focused solely on nitrogen manufacturing and distribution 

in july 2015 we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk group limited formerly known as growhow uk group limited cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us for total consideration of 570 million and cf fertilisers uk became wholly owned by us this transaction added cf fertilisers uk’s nitrogen manufacturing complexes in ince united kingdom and billingham united kingdom to our consolidated manufacturing capacity 

in february 2016 our strategic venture with chs commenced at which time chs made a capital contribution of 28 billion to cfn in exchange for membership interests in cfn which represented approximately 11 of the total membership interests of cfn 

in late 2015 and 2016 we completed certain capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa these projects originally announced in 2012 included the construction of new ammonia urea and uan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex these plants increased our overall production capacity by approximately 25 improved our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville and improved our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location the total capital cost of the capacity expansion projects was 52 billion 

prior to april 2 2018 terra nitrogen limited partnership which owns and operates our nitrogen manufacturing facility in verdigris oklahoma was a subsidiary of tnclp tnclp was a publicly traded limited partnership of which we were the sole general partner and the majority limited partner and in which we owned an approximate 753 interest 

in 2018 we announced that in accordance with the terms of tnclp’s first amended and restated agreement of limited partnership as amended by amendment no 1 to the first amended and restated agreement of limited partnership the tnclp agreement of limited partnership terra nitrogen gp inc tngp the sole general partner of tnclp and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of cf holdings elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4612562 publicly traded common units of tnclp the tnclp public units on april 2 2018 tngp completed its purchase of the tnclp public units the purchase for an aggregate cash purchase price of 388 million we funded the purchase with cash on hand upon completion of the purchase cf holdings owned through its subsidiaries 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of tnclp

point lisas trinidad 

the point lisas nitrogen facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago is owned jointly through a 5050 venture with koch fertilizer llc this facility has the capacity to produce 720000 tons of ammonia annually from natural gas supplied under a contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc 

nitrogen product raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen manufacturing facilities in 2021 natural gas accounted for approximately 40 of our total production costs for nitrogen products our nitrogen manufacturing facilities have access to abundant competitivelypriced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs our facilities utilize the following natural gas hubs henry hub in louisiana sonat and tetco ela in louisiana oneok in oklahoma aeco in alberta ventura in iowa demarcation in kansas welcome in minnesota dawn and parkway in ontario and the national balancing point nbp in the united kingdom 

in 2021 our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consumed in the aggregate approximately 335 million mmbtus of natural gas we employ a combination of daily spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced supply of natural gas we also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices see note 16—derivative financial instruments for additional information about our natural gas hedging activities 

nitrogen product distribution 

the safe efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen products is critical for successful operations our nitrogen production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship products to terminals warehouses and customers each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location 

cf industries holdings inc 

our north american nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and to our storage facilities in the us and canada with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5000 tank and hopper cars as well as railcars provided by rail carriers our united kingdom nitrogen production facilities mainly ship products via truck 

the north american waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our donaldsonville verdigris and yazoo city facilities to ship ammonia and uan we employ a fleet of ten tow boats and twentyeight river barges which are primarily leased we also utilize contract marine services to move granular urea we can also export nitrogen products via seagoing vessels from our donaldsonville yazoo city billingham and ince manufacturing facilities 

the donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2000mile long nustar pipeline through which we have the ability to transport ammonia to ten terminals and shipping points in the midwestern us corn belt 

storage facilities and other properties 

as of december 31 2021 we owned or leased space at 51 inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 21state region of the united states canada and the united kingdom including storage at our production facilities we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately 30 million tons of product our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table 



 

1 capacity is expressed as the equivalent volume of uan measured on a 32 nitrogen content basis 

2 the owned facilities that store uan also can store ammonia 

3 our lease agreements are typically for periods of one to five years 

customers 

the principal customers for our nitrogen products are cooperatives independent fertilizer distributors traders wholesalers and industrial users sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force chs was our largest customer in 2021 and accounted for approximately 14 of our consolidated net sales we have a strategic venture with chs under which chs has a minority equity interest in cfn see note 18—noncontrolling interest for additional information on our strategic venture with chs 

competition 

our markets are global and intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

our primary north americanbased competitors include nutrien ltd koch fertilizer llc and iowa fertilizer company there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs which may include the benefit of government subsidies because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition from foreignsourced products continuously producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east the republic of trinidad and tobago north africa and russia have been major exporters to north america in recent years 

our primary united kingdom competition comes from imported products supplied by companies including yara international origin fertilisers ameropa chs and helm urea and uan are not produced in the united kingdom but along with an are widelytraded fertilizer products with limited barriers to entry 

cf industries holdings inc 

seasonality 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to weather conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other fertilizer producers generally manufacture and distribute products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom the european union and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the introduction of new chemicals or substances into a market the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act tsca the occupational safety and health act osha and various other federal state and local statutes violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment we may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future 

environmental health and safety expenditures 

our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2021 totaled approximately 31 million we estimate that we will have approximately 63 million of capital expenditures for environmental health and safety in 2022 in addition to support safe and reliable operations at our continuous process manufacturing facilities we conduct scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of our plant machinery and equipment which are referred to as turnarounds a further description of turnaround activities is included in note 7—property plant and equipment—net to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our manufacturing and distribution facilities such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cerclaremediation matters 

from time to time we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws in 2011 we received a notice from the idaho department of environmental quality ideq that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine site we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho the current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site based on a consent order entered into with ideq and the us forest service in 2014 we and the current property owner are currently conducting a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the site in 2015 we and several other parties received a notice that the us department of the interior and other trustees intend to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for 18 former phosphate mines and three former processing facilities in southeast idaho which includes the georgetown canyon former mine and processing facility see note 21—contingencies for additional information

regulation of greenhouse gases 

our production facilities emit greenhouse gases ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process we are subject to ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states 

our uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require these plants to purchase co 2 emissions allowances our facilities were previously subject to the european union greenhouse gas emission trading system eu ets which generally required us to hold or obtain emission allowances to offset ghg emissions from those aspects of our operations that were subject to regulation under this program beginning on january 1 2021 our uk manufacturing plants became subject to the uk emissions trading scheme uk ets the uk ets is similar to the eu ets although the uk ets regulations established a lower emission cap than was established under the eu ets no agreement has been reached as to whether the uk ets will establish a linkage with the eu ets or other national emission trading systems 

in canada we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canada’s national pollutant release inventory and ontario’s mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation in 2018 the federal greenhouse gas pollution pricing act came into effect pursuant to which environment and climate change canada eccc implemented the outputbased performance standard obps which was intended to function as a backstop to provincial greenhouse gas emissions regulations in june 2019 the eccc finalized the emission limits for carbon dioxide equivalent co 2 e emissions from nitrogen fertilizer products these emission limits are based on 95 of the average emissions intensity for the production of such products from all canadian nitrogen fertilizer plants reflecting that such products are deemed to be energyintensive and tradeexposed and thus subject to a less stringent emissions reduction requirement in the provinces and territories where the obps applies a facility whose carbon emissions exceed the applicable limits is required to offset emissions by obtaining and retiring surplus emission credits obtaining qualifying emissions offsets or paying a fee the fee under the obps for calendar year 2021 was cad 40 per tonne of excess carbon dioxide equivalent emissions and will be cad 50 per tonne in 2022 under the current program the excess emission fee will increase by cad 15 per year after 2022 reaching cad 170 per tonne by 2030 ontario saskatchewan and alberta filed suit challenging whether the federal government had jurisdiction to impose a federal carbon price on the provinces and territories but in march 2021 the supreme court of canada upheld the constitutionality of the greenhouse gas pollution pricing act 

in july 2019 the ontario government enacted a new ghg regulation called the emissionsperformance standards program eps that sets co 2 e emissions limits for nitrogen products based on a production weighted sectoral average for facilities whose carbon emissions exceed the applicable limit compliance options include the purchase of excess emission units for a fee of cad 40 per unit purchased in 2022 which can be used to offset excess emissions in the 2021 calendar period and cad 50 per unit purchased in 2023 to offset excess emissions in calendar year 2022 in september 2020 eccc announced that the ontario eps met the federal government’s minimum stringency benchmark requirements and in september 2021 the eccc announced that the federal obps would no longer apply in ontario beginning in january 2022 accordingly the ontario eps became applicable on january 1 2022 

in 2019 the alberta government passed the technology innovation and emission reduction implementation act tier which went into effect on january 1 2020 the tier requires large emitting facilities other than electricity producers which are subject to a different standard to comply with the least stringent of a “facilityspecific” benchmark of 90 of historical ghg emissions intensity from a threeyear baseline which intensity limit will be reduced by 1 a year beginning in 2021 or a benchmark reflecting the emissions intensity of the top 10 of facilities for a given sector the compliance options under the tier initially established the price for payments into its carbon fund at cad 30 per excess tonne of emissions in december 2019 the federal government determined that the tier met the stringency requirements of the obps with respect to its regulation of large industrial emitters for 2020 the levy for excess emissions of co 2 e in alberta for 2021 was cad 40 per tonne and it is anticipated that the alberta government will increase the levy for excess emissions of co 2 e for calendar year 2022 to cad 50 per tonne to match the price of carbon established in the obps 

in the united states ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels although some of the more significant developments to date including efforts of the united states environmental protection agency epa to regulate ghg emissions from fossil fuelfired power plants do not directly impose obligations on our facilities the epa issued a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities which are considered large emitters of ghgs to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and reporting the previous year’s emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result are required to 

cf industries holdings inc 

obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd construction permit applicable to such facilities we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to ghgs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects other than the states’ implementation of this permitting requirement none of the states where our us production facilities are locatediowa louisiana mississippi and oklahomahas proposed control regulations limiting ghg emissions 

increasing concern over the impacts of climate change is driving countries to establish ever more ambitious ghg reduction targets approximately 200 countries including the united states canada the united kingdom and the european union eu have joined the paris agreement an international agreement intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15°c above preindustrial levels each signatory is required to develop its own national plan to attain this objective in december 2020 the united kingdom announced a target to reduce ghg emission 68 from 1990 levels by 2030 canada has increased its emissions reduction target under the paris agreement to 4045 below 2005 levels by 2030 up from 30 in april 2021 the united states increased its goal to reduce ghg emissions to 5052 below 2005 levels by 2030 executive orders issued by the biden administration including in particular an executive order issued on january 27 2021 focusing on climate change evidence the administration’s intent to undertake numerous initiatives in an effort to reduce ghg emissions including promoting renewable energy development limiting or prohibiting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and in general making climate change considerations a critical component of federal policy 

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals more stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits

our longterm success depends on our people we are dedicated to creating a workplace where employees are proud to work and grow and where everyone feels empowered to do their best work we do this by investing in extensive recruitment training and professional development opportunities for our employees and fostering diversity and inclusion in our culture 

employee population we employed approximately 3000 employees at december 31 2021 of which 67 were located in the united states 19 in the united kingdom and 14 in canada as of december 31 2021 14 of our employees have worked for the company more than 20 years 17 of our employees have worked for the company between 11 and 20 years 29 of our employees have worked for the company between 6 and 10 years and 40 of our employees have worked at the company for less than 6 years fulltime employees represented approximately 99 of our workforce as of december 31 2021 and approximately 15 were covered by a collective bargaining agreement we supplement our workforce with contractors with specialized skill sets during periods of peak activity such as during turnarounds and maintenance events 

culture inclusion and diversity our core values and their underlying principles reflect our commitment to a diverse and inclusive culture treating one another with respect across the company all employees completed training to learn to recognize and address the effects of unconscious bias by challenging assumptions encouraging diversity of experience opinion and expression and supporting a workplace culture that actively strives to be more inclusive as of december 31 2021 approximately 14 of our global workforce was female and 16 of the company’s employees in frontline managerial roles were female minorities represented approximately 14 of the company’s us workforce and 13 of our us employees in managerial roles in order to continue to improve the inclusiveness and diversity of our company and culture our comprehensive esg goals announced in 2020 include goals to increase the representation of females and persons of color in senior leadership roles and to implement a program designed to increase the hiring and promotion of minority and female candidates as of december 31 2021 we had exceeded our representation goal with approximately 38 of senior leadership roles held by females and persons of color 

workforce health and safety operating in a safe and responsible manner is a core value and an integral part of what sets the company apart we believe that focusing on leading indicators  such as the behavioral safety practices we have incorporated into our annual incentive plan  to drive and measure activities that prevent and control safety incidents results in our industryleading safety record as of december 31 2021 our employee 12month rolling average recordable incident rate rir was 032 incidents per 200000 work hours and our total recordable injury count was nine for the year ended december

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties individually or in combination could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows references to tons refer to short tons and references to tonnes refer to metric tons 

market risks 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected 

historically selling prices for our products which are generally global commodities have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand for nitrogen is affected by planted acreage crop selection and fertilizer application rates driven by population growth gross domestic product growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood use of crops such as production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things demand also includes industrial uses of nitrogen for example chemical manufacturing and emissions reductants such as diesel exhaust fluid def supply is affected primarily by available production capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability energy prices government policies and global trade 

periods of strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to stimulate global investment in production capacity in the past fertilizer producers including cf holdings have built new production facilities or expanded capacity of existing production assets or announced plans to do so the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply availability and affect the balance of supply and demand and nitrogen selling prices in certain years global nitrogen fertilizer capacity has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating a surplus of global nitrogen fertilizer capacity which has led to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices for example in the twoyear period ended december 31 2017 additional production capacity came on line and at the same time the average selling price for our products declined 34 from 314 per ton in 2015 to 207 per ton in 2017 

additional production capacity is expected to come on line over the next 12 months outside of north america we cannot predict the impact of this additional capacity on nitrogen fertilizer selling prices also global or local economic political and financial conditions or changes in such conditions or other factors may cause acceleration of announced andor ongoing projects similarly lower energy prices can spur increases in production in high cost regions which would result in increased supply and pressure on selling prices additionally if imports increase into an oversupplied region lower prices in that region could result 

during periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production in 2016 and 2017 our financial performance credit ratings and the trading price for our common stock were negatively impacted by the lower selling prices resulting from the global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer while in 2018 and 2019 we experienced increases in the average selling price for our products in 2020 the average selling price for our products decreased 14 to 203 per ton compared to 235 per ton in 2019 in 2021 the average selling price for our products increased 74 to 353 per ton compared to 2020 due to the cyclical nature of our industry we cannot predict the timing of oversupply and undersupply conditions the period of time that these conditions will persist or the degree to which oversupply conditions will impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our nitrogen products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers and related nitrogen products that we produce such as industrial grade ammonium nitrate an and def are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent customer service and product quality as a consequence conditions in the international market for nitrogen products significantly influence our operating results 

we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of our competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities furthermore certain governments in some cases as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products or subsidize production or consumption in order to support domestic employment or other political or social 

cf industries holdings inc 

goals our competitive position could suffer if we are not able to expand our own resources to a similar extent either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions or joint ventures 

china the world’s largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers currently has capacity surplus and many highcost plants as a result the domestic nitrogen industry in china is operating at less than full capacity a number of factors could encourage china to increase product capacity utilization including changes in chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi the relaxation of chinese environmental standards or decreases in chinese producers’ underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal any resulting increase in export volume could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time certain of our competitors with significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity have benefited from nonmarket pricing of natural gas which has resulted in significant volumes of exports to the united states for example the 2016 revocations of us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia allowed for increased imports from that country into the united states in recent years in addition high volumes of urea ammonium nitrate solution uan imports from russia and trinidad and tobago have negatively affected us producers’ uan profitability 

we also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe latin america and africa these producers depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows some of these producers also benefit from nonmarket or governmentset rates for natural gas pricing 

in addition the international market for nitrogen products is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact on the cost of importing nitrogen products into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate including the imposition of new duties tariffs or quotas that affect foreign trade and investment for example the imposition of duties tariffs or quotas in a region can directly impact product pricing in that region which can lead to changes in global trade flows and impact the global supply and demand balance and pricing market participants customarily move product between regions of the world or adjust trade flows in response to these factors north america where we manufacture and sell most of our products is one of the largest and most liquid nitrogen trading regions in the world as a result other manufacturers traders and other market participants can move nitrogen products to north america when there is uncertainty associated with the supply and demand balance in other regions or when duties tariffs or quotas impact prices or trade flows in other regions thus duties tariffs and quotas can lead to uncertainty in the global marketplace and impact the supply and demand balance in many regions which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows on october 9 2019 the european commission the commission imposed definitive antidumping duties on imports to the european union of uan manufactured in russia the republic of trinidad and tobago and the united states for imports of uan manufactured in the united states the fixed duty rate is €2948 per tonne or €2674 per ton the duties will remain in place for an initial fiveyear period unless the commission suspends them before the fiveyear period has expired after the initial fiveyear period the commission may renew the measures the longterm impact of these duties on the international market for nitrogen products is uncertain 

a decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the demand for our products 

conditions in the united states europe india brazil china and other global agricultural areas significantly impact our operating results agricultural planted areas and production can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices crop disease andor livestock disease demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding production of or trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control 

governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies commodity support programs and tariffs environmental and greenhouse gas policies as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand representing approximately 35 of total us corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production various interested parties have called to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of 

cf industries holdings inc 

ethanol gasoline and corn lower gasoline prices and fewer aggregate miles driven by increased automobile fuel efficiency the continued expansion of electric vehicle use or the impact of decreased travel resulting from the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand 

developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate or nitrogenefficient varieties or developments in alternatives to traditional animal feed or alternative proteins could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products widespread adoption of emerging application technologies or alternative farming techniques could disrupt traditional application practices affecting the volume or types of products used and timing of applications in addition from time to time various foreign government and us state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the negative impact of these products on the environment for example the united kingdom is currently consulting with stakeholders and reviewing proposals to limit emissions from solid urea fertilizers including a potential ban on urea fertilizers while cf fertilisers uk limited does not sell solid urea fertilizer in the united kingdom other jurisdictions may consider limits on fertilizer use such as the european union which announced its farm to fork and biodiversity strategies or canada which as part of its healthy environment healthy economy plan announced plans in late 2020 to introduce a target of reducing emissions from fertilizers by 30 below 2020 levels and has begun informal consultations with industry and other stakeholders on this proposal these or other more stringent limitations on greenhouse gas emissions applicable to farmers the endusers of our nitrogen fertilizers could reduce the demand for our fertilizer products to the extent their use of our products increases farmlevel emissions any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including as a result of technological developments andor limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is dependent on natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility 

nitrogen from the atmosphere and hydrogen from natural gas coal and other carbon energy feedstocks or from the electrolysis of water are the fundamental building blocks of nitrogen products energy feedstock costs comprise a significant portion of the total production cost of nitrogen products and relative to the industry’s marginal producers that set the global price of nitrogen generally determine profitability for nitrogen producers our manufacturing processes utilize natural gas as the principal raw material used in our production of nitrogen products we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products 

most of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada as a result north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products in recent years the cost of north american natural gas for the production of nitrogen fertilizers has been significantly lower than the energy costs of the industry’s marginal nitrogen producers changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to extended periods of higher natural gas prices in addition any increases in the volume of liquefied natural gas exported from the us to other regions particularly regions where nitrogen products are produced could increase our natural gas costs andor lower natural gas costs for our competitors if high natural gas prices were to persist in north america and significantly erode our favorable energy cost differentials relative to the marginal nitrogen producers it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2021 the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 236 per mmbtu on april 7 2021 and a high of 2361 per mmbtu on february 18 2021 during the threeyear period ended december 31 2021 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 134 per mmbtu on september 22 2020 and three consecutive days in october 2020 and a high of 2361 per mmbtu on february 18 2021 

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe which has also been volatile in recent years and reached unprecedented high levels in 2021 the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2021 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 558 per mmbtu on february 23 2021 and a high of 6010 per mmbtu on december 22 2021 during the threeyear period ended december 31 2021 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 104 per mmbtu on may 22 2020 and a high of 6010 per mmbtu on december 22 2021 the high price for natural gas in the united kingdom has had an effect on our local operations resulting in the idling of certain of our united kingdom plants in 2021 since the third quarter of 2021 the price for natural gas in the united kingdom has remained high the average daily market price of natural gas at nbp for january 2022 was 2591 per mmbtu 

cf industries holdings inc 

the price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices resulting in production of less associated gas 

certain of our operating facilities are located near natural gas hubs that have experienced increased natural gas development and have favorable basis differences as compared to other north american hubs favorable basis differences in certain regions may dissipate over time due to increases in natural gas pipeline or storage capacity in those regions additionally basis differentials may become materially unfavorable due to a lack of inbound gas pipeline or storage capacity in other regions during periods of unusually high demand increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if reduced production increased demand or changes in basis were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supply and demand balance for natural gas in north america or elsewhere natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations adverse weather conditions could become more frequent andor more severe as a result of climate change 

weather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting growing harvesting or application periods may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following application period resulting in lower seasonal demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions during or following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers adverse weather conditions could also impact transportation of fertilizer which could disrupt our ability to deliver our products to customers on a timely basis our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in fertilizer applications planting schedules and purchasing patterns over the longerterm changes in weather patterns may shift the periods of demand for products and even the regions to which our products are distributed which could require us to evolve our distribution system 

in addition we use the north american waterway system extensively to ship products from some of our manufacturing facilities to our distribution facilities and our customers we also export nitrogen fertilizer products via seagoing vessels from deepwater docking facilities at certain of our manufacturing sites therefore persistent significant changes in river or ocean water levels either up or down such as a result of flooding drought or climate change for example may require changes to our operating and distribution activities andor significant capital improvements to our facilities 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can disrupt our operations and can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen products colder andor longer than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events not only can cause loss of power at our facilities or damage to or delays in logistics capabilities disrupting our operations but also can impact the supply of natural gas and utilities and cause prices to rise 

all of the adverse weather conditions described above including those impacting our customers and our operations such as the physical risk from storms hurricanes tornadoes or floods could become more frequent andor more severe as a result of climate change our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane or high wind activity and several of our complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather in the last several years there has been an increase in the frequency and severity of adverse weather conditions including in the geographic areas where we have operations any significant adverse weather event or combination of adverse weather events could decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations — any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs 

cf industries holdings inc 

during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other fertilizer producers generally manufacture and distribute products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application seasons and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements to build inventory being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season 

if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations would be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price could be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of nitrogen fertilizer prices the constraints of our storage capacity and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results 

a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and working capital and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity by reducing our working capital needs due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assets 

any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months 

we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis 

operational risks 

our operations are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and any delay or interruption in the delivery of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas and other raw materials in the manufacture of our nitrogen products we purchase the natural gas and other raw materials from third party suppliers our natural gas is transported by pipeline to our facilities by third party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties delays or interruptions in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials may be caused by among other things severe weather or natural disasters unscheduled downtime labor difficulties or shortages insolvency of our suppliers or their inability to meet existing contractual arrangements deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents or mechanical failures in addition the transport of natural gas by pipeline is subject to additional risks including delays or interruptions caused by capacity constraints leaks or ruptures any delay or interruption in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials even for a limited period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers and are subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight this exposes us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to additional liability 

we rely on natural gas pipelines to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities in addition we rely on railroad barge truck vessel and pipeline companies to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the 

cf industries holdings inc 

inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages shutdowns delays accidents such as spills and derailments vessel groundings and other accidents and operating hazards additionally due to the aging infrastructure of certain rail lines bridges roadways pipelines river locks and equipment that our third party service providers utilize we may experience delays in both the receipt of raw materials or the shipment of finished product while repairs maintenance or replacement activities are conducted also certain third party service providers such as railroads have experienced periodic service delays or shutdowns due to capacity constraints in their systems operational and maintenance difficulties blockades weather or safetyrelated embargoes and delays and other events which could impact the shipping of our products and cause disruption in our supply chain 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents discharges or other releases of hazardous substances terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives governmental entities could implement new or more stringent regulatory requirements affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products 

if shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies’ failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements were implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there were significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the united states and canada the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads’ potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads shift liability to shippers by contract purport to shift liability to shippers by tariff or otherwise seek to require shippers to indemnify and defend the railroads from and against liabilities including in negligence strict liability or statutory liability that may arise from certain acts or omissions of the railroads third parties who may have insufficient resources or the company unknown causes or acts of god these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads third parties or us for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new or more stringent regulatory requirements also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products restrictions on service increases in transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors and any railroad industry initiatives that may impact our ability to transport our products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities 

our nitrogen manufacturing facilities are located at nine separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represented approximately 40 of our ammonia production capacity as of december 31 2021 the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows operational disruptions could occur for many reasons including natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance and other manufacturing problems disease strikes or other labor unrest or transportation interruptions for example our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences severe weather including a relatively high level of hurricane or high wind activity and several of our other complexes are also located in areas that experience severe weather such storms and severe weather events depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to affect adversely the shipping and distribution of our products moreover our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace or have long delivery lead times due in part to a limited number of suppliers and could result in operational disruptions 

cf industries holdings inc 

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems and any technology disruption or cybersecurity incident could negatively affect our operations 

we rely on internal and thirdparty information technology and computer control systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications the management of our accounting financial and supply chain functions and plant operations if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build implement and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors inaccurate financial reporting processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach in addition our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees business partners customers or suppliers and may subject us to legal liability 

as with most large systems our information technology systems and the systems of our suppliers have in the past been and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyber attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase to date we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations at one or more sites delay production and shipments result in the theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation result in legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy or other laws or increased costs for security and remediation or raise concerns regarding our accounting for transactions each of these consequences could adversely affect our business reputation and our financial statements 

our business involves the use storage and transmission of information about our employees customers and suppliers the protection of such information as well as our proprietary information is critical to us the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our employees customers or suppliers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us or our employees customers suppliers or other individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability these events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain nitrogen products as explosives we are subject to various security laws and regulations in the united states these security laws include the maritime transportation security act of 2002 and the chemical facilities antiterrorism standards regulation in addition president obama issued in 2013 executive order 13650 improving chemical facility safety and security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers and other nitrogen products these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen products that can be used as explosives it is possible that governmental entities in the united states or elsewhere could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen products thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for us

we are subject to risks associated with international operations 

our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions 

changes in governmental trade policies can lead to the imposition of new taxes levies duties tariffs or quotas affecting agricultural commodities fertilizer or industrial products these can alter costs trade flows access to supplies or demand and regional balances for our products 

our principal reporting currency is the us dollar and our business operations and investments outside the united states increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change we may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by among other things requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in or indexed to the us dollar or a currency freely convertible into us dollars or hedging through foreign currency derivatives these efforts however may not be effective and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs in various jurisdictions including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 the canadian corruption of foreign public officials act and economic sanctions programs administered by the united nations the european union and the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury and regulations set forth under the comprehensive iran accountability divestment act as a result of doing business internationally we are exposed to a risk of violating anticorruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we our partners or agents operate violations of anticorruption and sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and termination of existing contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment the violation of applicable laws by our employees consultants agents or partners could subject us to penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation administration and enforcement will change over time changes in antitrust laws globally or in their interpretation administration or enforcement may limit our existing or future operations and growth 

financial risks 

our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacture transportation storage and distribution of chemical products including ammonia which is highly toxic and can be corrosive and ammonium nitrate which is explosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled plant downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations for an extended period of time andor the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 

in april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities were named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits alleging various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we did not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities manufactured and sold to others were delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident nearly all of the cases including all wrongful death and personal injury claims have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements that have been or we expect will be fully funded by insurance the remaining subrogation and statutory indemnification claims total approximately 

cf industries holdings inc 

37 million before prejudgment interest the increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilities 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to various selfinsured retentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfinsured retentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage there can be no assurance that we will be able to buy and maintain insurance with adequate limits and reasonable pricing terms and conditions 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow prevent us from fulfilling our obligations and impair our ability to pursue or achieve other business objectives 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 35 billion of total funded indebtedness consisting primarily of unsecured senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2023 and 2044 or approximately 36 of our total capitalization total debt plus total stockholders’ equity and an additional 750 million of unsecured senior borrowing availability reflecting no outstanding borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit for general corporate purposes under our revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement our substantial debt service obligations will have an impact on our earnings and cash flow for so long as the indebtedness is outstanding 

our indebtedness could as a result of our debt service obligations or through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it could 

• make it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us not to have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments 

• cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions 

• cause us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital and capital expenditures and other business activities 

• cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings including borrowings under the revolving credit agreement could be at variable rates of interest 

• make us more leveraged than some of our competitors which could place us at a competitive disadvantage 

• restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or utilize excess cash to repurchase shares of our common stock 

• limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and 

• result in our credit ratings being downgraded which could increase the cost of further borrowings 

we expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur significant additional debt if we incur additional indebtedness the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could intensify if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate our relations with our creditors including the holders of our outstanding debt securities the lenders under the revolving credit agreement and our suppliers may be materially and adversely affected 

cf industries holdings inc 

a failure to satisfy the financial maintenance covenants under the revolving credit agreement or a breach of the covenants under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness could limit the borrowing availability under the revolving credit agreement or result in an event of default under such agreements 

our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness including the consolidated interest coverage ratio and consolidated net leverage ratio maintenance covenants contained in the revolving credit agreement will depend upon our future performance and various other factors such as market prices for our nitrogen products natural gas prices and other business competitive and regulatory factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to maintain compliance with all of these covenants in that event we may not be able to access the borrowing availability under the revolving credit agreement and we would need to seek an amendment to our debt agreements or would need to refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we can obtain future amendments or waivers of our debt agreements and instruments or refinance our debt and even if we were able to do so such relief might only last for a limited period potentially necessitating additional amendments waivers or refinancings any noncompliance by us with the covenants under our debt agreements and instruments could result in an event of default under those debt agreements and instruments an event of default under an agreement or instrument governing any of our indebtedness may allow our creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if our lenders or holders of our debt securities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we may be forced to liquidate certain assets to repay all or part of our indebtedness which could materially and adversely impair our business operations an event of default under the revolving credit agreement would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the revolving credit agreement in the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness we cannot assure that we would have sufficient assets to make such repayment 

potential future downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital cause vendors to change their credit terms for doing business with us and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

as of february 14 2022 our corporate credit rating by sp global ratings is bbb with a stable outlook our corporate credit rating by moody’s investor services inc is ba1 with a positive outlook and our corporate credit rating with fitch ratings inc is bbb with a stable outlook these ratings and our current credit condition affect among other things our ability to access new capital especially debt as well as the payment terms that vendors are willing to provide us negative changes in these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt and could cause vendors to shorten our payment terms require us to pay in advance for materials or services or provide letters of credit security or other credit enhancements in order to do business with us 

tax matters including changes in tax laws or rates adverse determinations by taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in i the united states where most of our operations are located and ii several foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized or conduct business tax laws or rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rate could also be affected by changes in our mix of earnings from jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates and tax systems changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have used the cash we generate outside the united states primarily to fund development of our business in nonus jurisdictions if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the united states we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the united states under the tax laws of the foreign countries in which we operate those international earnings could be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated therefore the repatriation of those earnings could result in an increase in our worldwide effective tax rate and an increase in our use of cash to pay these taxes 

we also need to comply with other new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in carbon taxes tariffs or value added taxes or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

cf industries holdings inc 

the united states and other countries in which we operate are in the process of implementing the organization for economic cooperation and development’s oecd base erosion and profit shifting project beps which is intended to improve tax disclosure and transparency and eliminate structures and activities that could be perceived by a particular country as resulting in tax avoidance the oecd has partially developed and continues with development of a framework to assist member countries in adopting beps related legislation each country is permitted to introduce its own legislation to implement beps legislation as a number of our business operations do business across country lines we are subject to beps the implementation of beps could result in tax changes and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes results of operations and cash flows in some cases beps legislation could result in double taxation on a portion of our profits without an appropriate mechanism to recover the incremental tax amount in another jurisdiction 

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives and the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses 

we may utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased products we have used natural gas futures swaps and option contracts traded in overthecounter markets or on exchanges we have also used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts to hedge our exposure to natural gas price volatility in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may from time to time use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts 

our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidity 

hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies 

our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments or by the triggering of any cross default provisions or credit support requirements against us additionally the international swaps and derivative association master netting arrangements for most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position 

at other times we may not utilize derivatives or derivative strategies to hedge certain risks or to reduce the financial exposure of price volatility as a result we may not prevent certain material adverse impacts that could have been mitigated through the use of derivative strategies 

environmental and regulatory risks 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws regulations and permitting requirements as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom the european union the republic of trinidad and tobago and other locations including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the introduction of new chemicals or substances into a market the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition and cleanup of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international laws in november 2021 the infrastructure investment and jobs act reinstated and doubled the superfund tax on chemicals including ammonia and nitric acid these taxes will be in place from july 1 2022 through december 31 2031 and apply to all domestic and imported products not used as fertilizer 

as a producer of nitrogen fertilizer products working with hazardous substances our business faces risks of spills discharges or other releases of those substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current facilities or facilities previously owned by us or other acquired businesses adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal 

cf industries holdings inc 

locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental health and safety laws change regularly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental health and safety laws and regulations we may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time our production distribution or storage of anhydrous ammonia and other hazardous or regulated substances has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our operations andor resulted in liability for administrative penalties andor claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion or modification of our operations is predicated upon securing necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval or a determination that we have violated a law or permit as a result of a governmental inspection of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at our facilities and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

future regulatory or legislative restrictions on greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process because conventional ammonia production generates co 2 as an unavoidable chemical byproduct ammonia production globally is considered an emissions and energyintensive industry we are subject to ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states in the united states our existing facilities which are considered large emitters of ghgs currently are only subject to ghg emissions reporting obligations new facilities that we build or existing facilities that we modify in the future could also be subject to ghg emissions standards included in their air permits 

beginning on january 1 2021 our uk manufacturing plants became subject to the uk emissions trading scheme uk ets which generally requires us to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset ghg emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program given the recent development of the uk ets there is substantial uncertainty as to the liquidity in the market for and the stability of the price of emission allowances that will be necessary for compliance with the regulations our manufacturing plants in the alberta and ontario provinces of canada are subject to provincial or federal laws that impose a price on excess ghg emissions each of these laws establishes carbon dioxide equivalent co 2 e emissions standards applicable to our facilities in terms of emissions per unit of production with the provincial laws and the federal law using different formulas for establishing these intensity limits and changes in these limits over time if co 2 e emissions exceed the applicable limits the excess emissions must be offset either through obtaining qualifying emission credits or offsets or by making a payment for each ton of excess emissions 

increasing concern over the impacts of climate change is driving countries to establish ever more ambitious ghg reduction targets approximately 200 countries including the united states canada the united kingdom and the members of the european union eu have joined the paris agreement an international agreement intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15ºc above preindustrial levels each signatory is required to develop its own national plan to attain this objective in december 2020 the united kingdom announced a target to reduce ghg emissions 68 from 1990 levels by 2030 canada has increased its emissions reduction target under the paris agreement to 4045 up from 30 below 2005 levels by 2030 in april 2021 the united states increased its goal to reduce emissions to 5052 below 2005 levels by 2030 the biden administration has also issued several executive orders focused on climate change to promote more active management of these issues across the executive branch including by the epa and the departments of agriculture interior transportation and treasury 

cf industries holdings inc 

in july 2021 the eu proposed a new carbon border adjustment mechanism that would require importers of certain products including nitrogen fertilizers to pay an import tax approximately equal to the costs incurred by eu producers of the products starting in 2026 other governments are also considering border adjustment mechanisms for carbon intensive products the imposition of any carbon border adjustment taxes may distort investment and trade flows which could adversely impact our business 

more stringent ghg regulations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows changes could also be made to tax policies related to decarbonization and clean energy that could impact our business and investment decisions in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states canada or the united kingdom our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us 

strategic risks 

the market for green and blue lowcarbon ammonia may be slow to develop may not develop to the size expected or may not develop at all moreover we may not be successful in the development and implementation of our green and blue ammonia projects in a timely or economic manner or at all due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

the market for green and blue lowcarbon ammonia is developing and evolving may not develop to the size or at the rate we expect and is dependent in part on the developing market for green and blue lowcarbon hydrogen for which ammonia can serve as a transport and storage mechanism these markets are heavily influenced by demand for clean energy technology evolution and federal state and local government laws regulations and policies concerning carbon emissions clean energy and corporate accountability in the united states and abroad 

we believe the demand for green and blue ammonia could take several years to materialize and then ten or more years to fully develop and mature and we cannot be certain that this market or the market for green and blue hydrogen will grow to the size or at the rate we expect hydrogen currently accounts for less than 1 of the world’s energy needs 

the recognition and acceptance of green and blue ammonia as a transport and storage mechanism for green and blue hydrogen the use of green and blue ammonia as a fuel in its own right the use of green and blue ammonia as a fertilizer and the development and growth of end market demand and applications for green and blue hydrogen and green and blue ammonia are uncertain and dependent on a number of factors outside of our control these factors include among others the extent to which and rate at which cost competitive global renewable energy capacity increases the pricing of traditional and alternative sources of energy the realization of technological improvements required to increase the efficiency and lower the costs of production of green and blue ammonia the regulatory environment the rate and extent of infrastructure investment and development which may be affected by the relevant parties’ ability to obtain permits for these investments the availability of tax benefits and other incentives and our ability to provide green and blue ammonia offerings costeffectively in addition further development of alternative decarbonization technologies may result in viable alternatives to the use of blue ammonia for many potential decarbonization applications resulting in lower than expected market demand growth relative to our current expectations if a sustainable market for green or blue ammonia or hydrogen fails to develop develops more slowly than we anticipate or develops in a way that is not viable to serve with our assets and capabilities we may decide not to implement or may not be successful in implementing one or more elements of our multiyear strategic plan 

our clean energy strategy also depends on the realization of certain technical improvements required to increase the efficiency and lower the costs of production of green and blue ammonia over time as we seek to convert additional existing facilities to green and blue production and further expand our green and blue ammonia production capacity we may face operational difficulties and execution risks related to the design development and construction if our assumptions about the engineering and processing characteristics necessary to successfully build the facility capacity that we are contemplating and to scale up to larger production quantities prove to be incorrect we may be unable to produce substantial quantities of green or blue ammonia and the cost to construct or convert such green and blue ammonia facilities or the production costs associated with the operation of such facilities may be higher than we project the production of blue ammonia depends to a large extent upon development by third parties of carbon capture and storage wells which are not wellestablished technologies and are subject to a permitting process and operational risks which may result in delays impact viability in some or all situations or create longterm liabilities

we may not be successful in the expansion of our business 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both within the united states and elsewhere major investments in our business including acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments such as our green and blue ammonia projects require significant managerial resources the diversion of which from our other activities or opportunities may negatively affect the existing operations of our business we may be unable to identify or successfully compete for certain acquisition targets which may hinder or prevent us from acquiring a target or completing other transactions the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or business combination transactions may increase due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented in addition these efforts may require capital resources that could otherwise be used for the improvement and expansion of our existing business as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments among the risks associated with the pursuit and consummation of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments or business combinations are those involving 

• difficulties in integrating the parties’ operations systems technologies products cultures and personnel 

• incurrence of significant transactionrelated expenses 

• potential integration or restructuring costs 

• potential impairment charges related to the goodwill intangible assets or other assets to which any such transaction relates in the event that the economic benefits of such transaction prove to be less than anticipated 

• other unanticipated costs associated with such transactions 

• our ability to achieve operating and financial efficiencies synergies and cost savings 

• our ability to obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from any such transaction 

• the parties’ ability to retain key business relationships including relationships with employees customers partners and suppliers 

• potential loss of key personnel 

• entry into markets or involvement with products with which we have limited current or prior experience or in which competitors may have stronger positions 

• assumption of contingent liabilities including litigation 

• exposure to unanticipated liabilities including litigation 

• differences in the parties’ internal control environments which may require significant time and resources to resolve in conformity with applicable legal and accounting standards 

• increased scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 

• the tax effects of any such transaction and 

• the potential for costly and timeconsuming litigation including stockholder lawsuits 

moreover legal proceedings or other risks from acquisitions and other business combinations may arise years after a transaction has been completed and may involve matters unrelated to the business acquired for example we were recently named along with other parties in certain product liability actions relating to a product containing the herbicide paraquat which was allegedly sold manufactured distributed andor marketed by terra industries inc terra before it exited such lines of business which exit occurred more than ten years before cf holdings acquired terra in april 2010 

in addition major capital projects may be dependent on the availability and performance of engineering firms construction firms equipment and material suppliers transportation providers and other vendors necessary to design and implement those projects on a timely basis and on acceptable terms major investments such as capital improvements at our facilities are subject to a number of risks any of which could prevent us from completing capital projects in a timely or economic manner or at all including without limitation cost overruns nonperformance of third parties the inability to obtain necessary permits or other permitting matters adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor and raw material shortages transportation constraints engineering and construction change orders errors in design construction or startup and other unforeseen difficulties 

international acquisitions partnerships joint ventures investments or business combinations and other international expansions of our business involve additional risks and uncertainties including but not limited to 

• the impact of particular economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

• challenges caused by distance and by language and cultural differences 

• difficulties and costs of complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations 

• unexpected changes in regulatory environments 

cf industries holdings inc 

• political and economic instability including the possibility for civil unrest 

• nationalization of properties by foreign governments 

• tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements 

• the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions and 

• the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

if we finance acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints under the terms of and as a result of the repayment and debtservice obligations under the additional indebtedness a business combination transaction between us and another company could result in our stockholders receiving cash or shares of another entity on terms that such stockholders may not consider desirable moreover the regulatory approvals associated with a business combination may result in divestitures or other changes to our business the effects of which are difficult to predict 

we are subject to risk associated with our strategic venture with chs inc chs 

we may not realize the full benefits from our strategic venture with chs that are expected the realization of the expected benefits of the chs strategic venture depends on our ability to operate and manage the strategic venture successfully and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with chs over the life of the agreement among other factors additionally any challenges related to the chs strategic venture could harm our relationships with chs or our other customers 

covid19 pandemic risk 

our business and operations may be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows the rapid spread of covid19 has resulted in governmental authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions facility closures or other restrictions we may be unable to meet customer demand or perform fully under our contracts the covid19 pandemic could also affect our customers suppliers and third party service providers including transportation providers and result in restrictions on or disruptions of transportation port closures or increased border controls or closures or other impacts on domestic and global supply chains or distribution channels which could increase our costs andor limit our ability to meet customer demand 

in addition the covid19 pandemic could reduce and has in the past reduced the demand for energy including crude oil as well as natural gas and coal which are nitrogen feedstocks reduced demand for nitrogen feedstocks could reduce the cost of nitrogen production outside of north america which could increase global nitrogen supply and reduce the market prices of our products lower demand for crude oil could also reduce the supply and therefore increase the cost of natural gas which is the principal raw material used in our production of nitrogen products the pandemic has also disrupted traditional food supply chains which may have a material impact on livestock and food demand including the demand for corn each of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are unable to predict the ultimate impact the covid19 pandemic may have on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows the extent to which our operations may be impacted by covid19 will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted including the further spread of the virus the rise of new variants of covid19 the duration of the pandemic and the type and duration of actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to these developments in 2020 the pandemic significantly increased global market uncertainty and caused an economic slowdown which resulted in a global recession persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

litigation 

west fertilizer co 

on april 17 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities were named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases were consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption “in re west explosion cases” the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325 individuals and 80 insurance companies plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we did not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities manufactured and sold to others were delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident 

the court granted in part and denied in part the cf entities’ motions for summary judgment in august 2015 nearly all of the cases including all wrongful death and personal injury claims have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements that have been or we expect will be fully funded by insurance the remaining subrogation and statutory indemnification claims total approximately 37 million before prejudgment interest and are in various stages of discovery and pretrial proceedings the remaining claims are expected to be set for trial in 2022 we believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the cf entities vigorously in the remaining lawsuits the company cannot provide a range of reasonably possible loss due to the uncertain nature of this litigation including uncertainties around the potential allocation of responsibility by a jury to other defendants or responsible third parties the recognition of a potential loss in the future in the west fertilizer co litigation could negatively affect our results in the period of recognition however based upon currently available information we expect any potential loss to be fully indemnified by insurance and do not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

overview of cf holdings 

our company 

our mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably with our employees focused on safe and reliable operations environmental stewardship and disciplined capital and corporate management we are on a path to decarbonize our ammonia production network – the world’s largest – to enable green and blue hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy fertilizer emissions abatement and other industrial activities our nine manufacturing complexes in the united states canada and the united kingdom an extensive storage transportation and distribution network in north america and logistics capabilities enabling a global reach underpin our strategy to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy our principal customers are cooperatives independent fertilizer distributors traders wholesalers and industrial users our core product is anhydrous ammonia ammonia which contains 82 nitrogen and 18 hydrogen our nitrogen products that are upgraded from ammonia are granular urea urea ammonium nitrate solution uan and ammonium nitrate an our other nitrogen products include diesel exhaust fluid def urea liquor nitric acid and aqua ammonia which are sold primarily to our industrial customers and compound fertilizer products npks which are solid granular fertilizer products for which the nutrient content is a combination of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium 

our principal assets as of december 31 2021 include 

• five us nitrogen manufacturing facilities located in donaldsonville louisiana the largest nitrogen complex in the world port neal iowa yazoo city mississippi verdigris oklahoma and woodward oklahoma these facilities are wholly owned directly or indirectly by cf industries nitrogen llc cfn of which we own approximately 89 and chs inc chs owns the remainder see note 18—noncontrolling interest for additional information on our strategic venture with chs 

• two canadian nitrogen manufacturing facilities located in medicine hat alberta the largest nitrogen complex in canada and courtright ontario 

• two united kingdom nitrogen manufacturing facilities located in billingham and ince 

cf industries holdings inc 

• an extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern united states and 

• a 50 interest in point lisas nitrogen limited plnl an ammonia production joint venture located in the republic of trinidad and tobago that we account for under the equity method 

our commitment to a clean energy economy 

we are taking significant steps to support a global hydrogen and clean fuel economy through the production of green and blue ammonia since ammonia is one of the most efficient ways to transport and store hydrogen and is also a fuel in its own right we believe that the company as the world’s largest producer of ammonia with an unparalleled manufacturing and distribution network and deep technical expertise is uniquely positioned to fulfill anticipated demand for hydrogen and ammonia from green and blue sources our approach includes green ammonia production which refers to ammonia produced through a carbonfree process and blue ammonia production which relates to ammonia produced by conventional processes but with co 2 removed through carbon capture and sequestration ccs and other certified carbon abatement projects 

in october 2020 we announced an initial green ammonia project at our donaldsonville complex in april 2021 we signed an engineering and procurement contract with thyssenkrupp to supply a 20 mw alkaline water electrolysis plant to produce green hydrogen at our donaldsonville complex construction and installation which is being managed by us began in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is expected to finish in 2023 with an estimated total cost of approximately 100 million the cost of the project is expected to fit within our annual capital expenditure budgets we will integrate the green hydrogen generated by the electrolysis plant into existing ammonia synthesis loops to enable the production of approximately 20000 tons per year of green ammonia we believe that when completed in 2023 the donaldsonville green ammonia project will be the largest of its kind in north america 

in the third quarter of 2021 we signed a memorandum of understanding with mitsui  co inc mitsui that will guide us in a joint exploration of the development of blue ammonia projects in the united states the preliminary studies we are conducting with mitsui cover areas such as blue ammonia supply and supply chain infrastructure co 2 transportation and storage expected environmental impacts and blue ammonia economics and marketing opportunities in japan and in other countries 

we have also announced steps to produce blue ammonia from our ammonia production network in the fourth quarter of 2021 our board of directors authorized projects that we believe will enable the annual production of up to 125 million tons of blue ammonia from our existing network starting in 2024 the projects will involve constructing units at our donaldsonville and yazoo city complexes that dehydrate and compress co 2  a process essential for co 2 transport via pipeline to sequestration sites management expects that once the units are in service and sequestration is initiated we could sequester up to 25 million tons of co 2 per year 2 million tons at donaldsonville and 500000 tons at yazoo city under current regulations the projects would be expected to qualify for tax credits under section 45q of the internal revenue code which provides a credit per tonne of co 2 sequestered 

construction of the units at the donaldsonville complex is expected to begin in 2022 and to be completed in 2024 with an estimated total cost of 200 million the yazoo city project will be timed to coincide with co 2 transport pipeline construction once started the project is expected to be completed in three years with an estimated total cost of 85 million in addition we are currently in advanced discussions with several parties regarding transportation and sequestration of co 2 from donaldsonville 

industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply and demand factors 

our products are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition the customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality the selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions changes in supply and demand and cost factors 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth gross domestic product growth changes in dietary habits planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand growth may depend on global economic conditions farm sector income weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to 

cf industries holdings inc 

consumption fertilizer application rates and governmental regulations including fertilizer subsidies or requirements mandating increased use of biofuels or industrial nitrogen products other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key exportingconsuming countries such as china india russia and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of nitrogenbased fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal therefore supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for these commodities 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit agricultural supply and demand industrial product demand and policies such as emissions abatement and governmental nitrogen product trade policies including the imposition of duties tariffs or quotas that affect foreign trade or investment the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last decade has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east the republic of trinidad and tobago north africa and russia have been major exporters to north america in recent years as a result the north american nitrogen fertilizer market for certain nitrogen products is dependent on imports to balance supply and demand 

farmers’ economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns crop and fertilizer prices fertilizer products used and timing of applications expected yields and the types of crops planted 

market conditions and current developments 

selling prices and sales volume 

the selling prices for all of our major products were higher in 2021 than 2020 driven by the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance as a result of strong global demand as well as decreased global supply availability as higher global energy costs drove lower global operating rates the average selling price for our products for 2021 and 2020 was 353 per ton and 203 per ton respectively the increase in average selling prices of 74 in 2021 from 2020 resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately 276 billion 

our total sales volume was 9 lower in 2021 than in 2020 with lower sales volume reported in all segments we shipped 185 million tons of product in 2021 compared to 203 million tons in 2020 due primarily to lower supply from the impact of both planned and unplanned maintenance activity and the impact of weatherrelated outages the lower sales volumes also reflect the idling of certain portions of our uk operations in september due to the united kingdom energy crisis which is further discussed below lower sales volume resulted in a decrease in net sales of approximately 404 million 

cf industries holdings inc 

sales volume for our products in 2021 2020 and 2019 is shown in the table below 



natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce our nitrogen products we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce nitrogen products natural gas is a significant cost component of manufactured nitrogen products representing approximately 40 of our production costs in 2021 the following table presents the average daily market price of natural gas at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america and the national balancing point the major trading point for natural gas in the united kingdom 



most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada as a result the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses north american natural gas prices during 2021 were higher on average than during 2020 due to tight supply and demand conditions within the market demand for natural gas was strong throughout 2021 as cold weather early in the year including the impact of winter storm uri in february contributed to strength in demand warmer weather in the summer of 2021 contributed to higher natural gas usage for electrical generation and the economy emerging from covid19 pandemic conditions added to the strong summer demand the supply response from natural gas producers during 2021 was insufficient to offset these demand factors leading to higher prices throughout the year in addition liquefied natural gas lng exports increased significantly in 2021 compared to 2020 as favorable pricing differentials between north america and global natural gas prices led lng facilities in the united states to run at near maximum levels the average daily market price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america was 382 per mmbtu for 2021 compared to 199 per mmbtu for 2020 an increase of 92 during 2021 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 236 per mmbtu on april 7 2021 and a high of 2361 per mmbtu on february 18 2021 as a result of winter storm uri 

in february 2021 the central portion of the united states experienced extreme and unprecedented cold weather due to the impact of winter storm uri certain natural gas suppliers and natural gas pipelines declared force majeure events due to natural gas well freezeoffs or frozen equipment this occurred at the same time as large increases in natural gas demand were occurring due to the cold temperatures due to these unprecedented factors several states declared a state of emergency and natural gas was redirected for residential use at certain of our manufacturing locations we reduced our natural gas consumption and as a consequence our plants at these locations either operated at reduced rates or temporarily suspended operations we net settled certain natural gas contracts with our suppliers and received prevailing market prices which were in excess of our cost as a result we recognized a gain of 112 million which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 

cf industries holdings inc 

our two nitrogen manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the price of natural gas in the united kingdom increased throughout 2021 and reached unprecedented high levels in the third quarter and even higher levels in the fourth quarter the increase in natural gas prices was due to the combination of low storage levels in europe reduced supply from russia and a tight global supply and demand balance in the lng market as a result of strong demand in both europe and asia to fill storage locations in anticipation of winter due to the high price levels for natural gas we halted certain of our uk manufacturing operations in september 2021 see the discussion under “united kingdom energy crisis” below for further information 

the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp the average daily market price at nbp was 1550 per mmbtu for 2021 compared to 320 per mmbtu for 2020 an increase of 384 during 2021 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 558 per mmbtu on february 23 2021 and a high of 6010 per mmbtu on december 22 2021 the average daily market price of natural gas at nbp for january 2022 was 2591 per mmbtu 

in 2021 the total cost of natural gas used for production at all of our locations which includes the impact of realized natural gas derivatives and excludes the 112 million gain that resulted from the net settlement of certain natural gas contracts with our suppliers increased 88 to 421 from 224 per mmbtu in 2020 this increase in natural gas costs resulted in a decrease in gross margin of 663 million 

united kingdom energy crisis 

during the third quarter of 2021 the united kingdom began experiencing an energy crisis that included a substantial increase in the price of natural gas in the first half of 2021 natural gas prices had increased to levels that were considered high compared to historical prices and prices then more than doubled in the third quarter of 2021 

on september 15 2021 we announced the halt of operations at both our ince and billingham manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom due to negative profitability driven by the high cost of natural gas the halt of operations at our uk plants impacted the availability of certain products in the united kingdom including carbon dioxide which is a byproduct of ammonia production due to the critical nature of carbon dioxide to certain industries in the united kingdom on september 21 2021 we entered into an interim agreement with the uk government under the terms of the agreement the uk government agreed to cover the costs to restart the ammonia plant at billingham and to offset losses incurred from production for a 21day period as a result we resumed production of ammonia at the billingham facility in order to produce carbon dioxide for the united kingdom while the interim agreement was in place we entered into new carbon dioxide pricing and offtake agreements with our customers which had an initial term through january 31 2022 the amount of financial support provided by the uk government under the terms of the interim agreement was not material as of the filing of this report production continues at our billingham facility and continues to be idled at our ince facility 

during the third quarter of 2021 the uk energy crisis necessitated an evaluation of the longlived assets including the definitelived intangible assets and goodwill of our uk operations to determine if their fair value had declined to below their carrying value we concluded that a decline in fair value had occurred and we recorded longlived asset and goodwill impairment charges of 495 million the continued impacts of the uk energy crisis in the fourth quarter of 2021 triggered an additional impairment test and we recognized an additional goodwill impairment charge of  26 million we recognized total impairment charges of  521 million in 2021 consisting of longlived and intangible asset impairment charges of  236 million and goodwill impairment charges of  285 million see “items affecting comparability of results—uk energy crisis impacts” and “liquidity and capital resources—united kingdom energy crisis” below note 6—united kingdom energy crisis and impairment charges note 7—property plant and equipment—net and note 8—goodwill and other intangible assets for further information as of december 31 2021 after the recognition of the  521 million of impairment charges noted above we have no remaining goodwill related to our uk operations and the remaining longlived assets related to our uk operations were approximately  425 million consisting primarily of property plant and equipment 

the results of our uk operations are included in our ammonia an and other segments and account for a small portion of our consolidated gross margin for the year ended december 31 2021 our uk operations generated negative gross margin representing approximately 1 of our consolidated gross margin for the year ended december 31 2020 gross margin generated by our uk operations accounted for 2 of our consolidated gross margin

manufacturing costs and granular urea purchases 

in 2021 we experienced lower production levels and higher manufacturing and maintenance costs than in 2020 certain of our plants operated at lower operating rates or temporarily suspended operations during 2021 due to the lack of natural gas due to winter storm uri or the impact of hurricane ida or due to maintenance activity including activity that was deferred from 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic in 2021 we had the highest level of maintenance activity in our history including turnarounds at seven of our 17 ammonia plants because of these factors including the halt of operations in the united kingdom we incurred higher costs for manufacturing maintenance and repair activity for both scheduled and unscheduled downtime in 2021 

in response to the lower production in 2021 as a result of weather conditions and maintenance activity we procured additional granular urea in order to meet customer obligations and provide additional manufacturing flexibility in the year ended december 31 2021 we purchased approximately 71 million of granular urea which we sold to customers for 68 million 

covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization characterized the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 as a pandemic due to the use of fertilizer products in crop production to support the global food supply chain our business operations were designated as part of the critical infrastructure by the united states and as essential businesses in the united kingdom and canada with corresponding designations by those states and provinces in which we operate as a result our manufacturing complexes were permitted to continue to operate and through the date of this report we have not suspended or shutdown operations as a result of the pandemic in addition we have continued to ship products by all modes of transportation to our customers and we have not experienced any significant delays in marine rail or truck transportation services due to the pandemic through the date of this report we have not experienced any meaningful impact in customer demand as a result of the pandemic 

in response to the pandemic along with the rise of new variants of covid19 we instituted and have continued to enforce safety precautions and encourage safe behavior in order to protect the health and wellbeing of all of our employees we will continue to monitor safety guidelines related to covid19 as issued by governmental authorities and adjust our safety protocols as needed

financial executive summary 

we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 917 million in 2021 compared to 317 million in 2020 an increase in net earnings of 189 or 600 million diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders increased 277 per share to 424 per share in 2021 compared to 147 per share in 2020 these increases were due primarily to higher operating results driven by an increase in gross margin partially offset by impairment charges related to our uk operations 

impact of higher gross margin 

gross margin increased by 159 billion in 2021 to 239 billion as compared to 801 million in 2020 the following table and related discussion describe the significant factors that drove the increase in gross margin

3 represents the variance in the net unrealized marktomarket gains and losses on natural gas derivatives compared to the prior year period 

4 represents the impact of the incremental tons compared to the prior year period 

• average selling prices increased 74 in 2021 to 353 per ton from 203 per ton in 2020 which increased gross margin by approximately 276 billion 

• sales volume decreased 9 to 185 million product tons in 2021 from 203 million product tons in 2020 which reduced gross margin by approximately 92 million 

• the cost of natural gas used for production increased 88 to 421 per mmbtu in 2021 from 224 per mmbtu in 2020 which reduced gross margin by 663 million 

• we incurred higher manufacturing maintenance and other costs which reduced gross margin by 494 million due primarily to higher plant turnaround and maintenance activity 

• we purchased 201000 tons of granular urea for 71 million to meet customer obligations which we sold to customers for 68 million and 

• the gain on the net settlement of certain natural gas contracts with our suppliers as a result of winter storm uri was 112 million 

impact of impairment charges 

net earnings and diluted net earnings per share in 2021 were impacted by impairment charges related to our uk operations of 521 million consisting of longlived and intangible asset impairment charges of 236 million and goodwill impairment charges of 285 million the aftertax impact of the impairment charges to net earnings attributable to common stockholders and diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders was 463 million and 214 respectively see “market conditions and current developments—united kingdom energy crisis” above note 6—united kingdom energy crisis and impairment charges note 7—property plant and equipment—net and note 8—goodwill and other intangible assets for further information

the following describes the significant items that impacted the comparability of our financial results in 2021 and 2020 descriptions of items below that refer to amounts in the table above refer to the pretax amounts except for the discussion under terra amended tax returns  

unrealized net marktomarket loss gain on natural gas derivatives 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile single component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased products at certain times we have managed the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivatives that we use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps basis swaps and options we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting this can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives which are reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations in 2021 and 2020 we recognized an unrealized net marktomarket loss gain on natural gas derivatives of 25 million and 6 million respectively 

covid impacts 

in march 2020 a shortterm bonus program was initiated to compensate operational employees for continuing their critical tasks at the beginning of the covid19 pandemic the bonus program concluded in june 2020 approximately 19 million was paid as part of the program and was recognized in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 

in addition certain plant turnaround activities were deferred because of the covid19 pandemic as a result we incurred 7 million of expense for the year ended december 31 2020 which was recognized in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations 

asset impairments 

as a result of the uk energy crisis and the events described under “market conditions and current developments—united kingdom energy crisis” above we recognized impairment charges of 521 million in 2021 including longlived and intangible asset impairment charges of 236 million and goodwill impairment charges of 285 million see note 6—united kingdom energy crisis and impairment charges note 7—property plant and equipment—net and note 8—goodwill and other intangible assets for further information 

loss on foreign currency transactions including intercompany loans

we completed the acquisition of terra industries inc terra in april 2010 after the acquisition we determined that the manner in which terra reported the repatriation of cash from foreign affiliates to its us parent for us and foreign income tax purposes was not appropriate as a result in 2012 we amended certain tax returns including terra’s income and withholding tax returns back to 1999 the amended tax returns and paid additional income and withholding taxes and related interest and penalties in 2013 the internal revenue service irs commenced an examination of the us tax aspects of the amended tax returns 

i n 2020 we received irs notices indicating the amount of tax and interest to be refunded and received with respect to the income tax and withholding tax returns as a result we recognized 26 million 23 million net of tax of interestrelated income and 18 million of additional income tax benefit see “liquidity and capital resources—terra amended tax returns” below for additional information

net sales 

our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen products and are determined by the quantities of nitrogen products we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

our total net sales increased 241 billion or 59 to 654 billion in 2021 compared to 412 billion in 2020 due to a 74 increase in average selling prices partially offset by a 9 decrease in sales volume 

average selling prices were 353 per ton in 2021 compared to 203 per ton in 2020 an increase of 74 due to higher average selling prices across all of our segments primarily driven by the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance as a result of strong global demand and decreased global supply availability as higher global energy costs drove lower global operating rates our total sales volume of 185 million product tons in 2021 was 9 lower compared to 203 million product tons in 2020 as a result of decreased supply due to lower production due primarily to a high level of plant turnaround and maintenance activity and downtime resulting from the impacts of winter storm uri and hurricane ida 

gross ammonia production for 2021 was approximately 93 million tons compared to 104 million tons in 2020 management expects gross ammonia production for 2022 will return to historical levels 95 to 100 million tons based on normal operating conditions and a return to a typical level of planned maintenance activities 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs consist of the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities which are recognized in cost of sales when the product is sold to our customers and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

our cost of sales increased 828 million or 25 to 415 billion in 2021 as compared to 332 billion in 2020 the increase in our cost of sales was due primarily to higher costs for natural gas including the impact of realized derivatives which increased cost of sales by 663 million higher manufacturing maintenance and other costs which increased cost of sales by 494 million and higher costs for purchased products as we purchased 71 million of granular urea in 2021 to meet customer obligations cost of sales also includes the impact of a 25 million unrealized net marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives in 2021 compared to a 6 million gain in 2020 

these items increasing our cost of sales were partially offset by the 112 million gain we recognized from the net settlement of certain natural gas contracts with our suppliers in february 2021 due to winter storm uri as described above under the heading “natural gas prices” in the section titled “market conditions and current developments” the 112 million gain on the net settlement of certain natural gas contracts in february 2021 is reflected in and had the effect of reducing our cost of sales in 2021 in addition there was a 312 million decline in cost of sales in 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to a 9 decline in sales volume 

cost of sales averaged 224 per ton in 2021 a 37 increase from 164 per ton in 2020 the cost of natural gas used for production including the impact of realized derivatives increased 88 to 421 per mmbtu in 2021 from 224 per mmbtu in 2020 the cost of natural gas used for production of 421 per mmbtu in 2021 does not include the 112 million gain from the net settlement of certain natural gas contracts in february 2021 

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial it and sales functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees including those for corporate initiatives 

cf industries holdings inc 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 17 million or 8 to 223 million in 2021 from 206 million in 2020 the increase was due primarily to higher incentive compensation due to strong operating performance 

longlived and intangible asset impairment and goodwill impairment 

in 2021 we recognized total impairment charges of 521 million consisting of longlived and intangible asset impairment charges of 236 million and goodwill impairment charges of 285 million see “united kingdom energy crisis” under “market conditions and current developments” above for further information 

other operating—net 

other operating—net includes administrative costs that do not relate directly to our central operations costs included in “other operating costs” can include foreign currency transaction gains and losses unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets 

other operating—net was 39 million of income in 2021 compared to 17 million of income in 2020 the income in 2021 primarily includes a gain of 29 million on sales of carbon credits in addition other operating—net includes the amount received under the terms of the agreement with the uk government associated with the restart of our billingham facility partially offset by a loss on foreign currency transactions of 6 million which includes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany loans that were not permanently invested the income in 2020 primarily includes insurance proceeds of 37 million partially offset by 9 million of expense related to the cancellation of a project which is described in the section above titled “items affecting comparability of results—engineering cost writeoff” and a loss on foreign currency transactions of 5 million 

equity in earnings of operating affiliate 

equity in earnings of operating affiliate consists of our 50 ownership interest in plnl we include our share of the net earnings from our equity method investment in plnl as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition 

equity in earnings of operating affiliate was 47 million in 2021 compared to 11 million in 2020 the increase was due primarily to an increase in the operating results of plnl as a result of higher ammonia selling prices partially offset by higher natural gas costs 

interest expense—net 

our interest expense—net includes the interest expense on our longterm debt amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements annual fees pursuant to our revolving credit agreement and interest on tax liabilities capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related assets interest expense—net also includes interest income which includes amounts earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments and any interest earned related to income tax refunds 

net interest expense increased by 22 million to 183 million in 2021 from 161 million in 2020 the increase was due primarily to 26 million of interest income in 2020 related to the finalization of the terra amended tax returns which is more fully described under “items affecting comparability of results—terra amended tax returns” above 

loss on debt extinguishment 

on march 20 2021 we redeemed in full all of the remaining 250 million outstanding principal amount of the 2021 notes in accordance with the optional redemption provisions in the indenture governing the 2021 notes the total aggregate redemption price paid in connection with the redemption on the 2021 notes was 258 million including accrued interest as a result we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 6 million consisting primarily of the premium paid on the redemption of the 2021 notes prior to their scheduled maturity 

on september 10 2021 we redeemed 250 million principal amount representing onethird of the 750 million principal amount outstanding immediately prior to such redemption of the 2023 notes in accordance with the optional redemption provisions in the indenture governing the 2023 notes the total aggregate redemption price paid in connection with the redemption of the 2023 notes was approximately 265 million including accrued interest as a result we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 13 million consisting primarily of the premium paid on the redemption of the 250 million principal amount of the 2023 notes prior to their scheduled maturity 

cf industries holdings inc 

other nonoperating—net 

other nonoperating—net was 16 million of income in 2021 compared to 1 million of income in 2020 the 16 million of income in 2021 was due primarily to a gain of 20 million on the sale of eu carbon credits that due to brexit could no longer be utilized by our uk plants for carbon emission obligations in the united kingdom 

income tax provision 

our income tax provision for 2021 was 283 million on pretax income of 1543 million or an effective tax rate of 183 compared to an income tax provision of 31 million on pretax income of 463 million or an effective tax rate of 67 in 2020 

for 2021 we did not record an income tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment charges described in note 6—united kingdom energy crisis and impairment charges as the goodwill impairment charges are nondeductible for income tax purposes our income tax provision for 2021 includes a 26 million benefit reflecting the impact of agreement on certain issues related to us federal income tax audits including a discrete income tax benefit of approximately 15 million due to the reversal of an accrual for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the effective settlement of the us federal income tax audit for the 20122016 tax years 

for 2020 our income tax provision includes a 27 million benefit related to the settlement of certain us and foreign income tax audits which primarily related to the settlement of the audit of the terra amended tax returns which is more fully described under “items affecting comparability of results—terra amended tax returns” above 

our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in cfn as our consolidated income tax provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest our effective tax rate for 2021 of 183 which is based on pretax income of 1543 million would be 53 percentage points higher or 236 if based on pretax income exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest of 343 million our effective tax rate for 2020 of 67 which is based on pretax income of 463 million would be 22 percentage points higher or 89 if based on pretax income exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest of 115 million 

both 2021 and 2020 were impacted by additional discrete tax items see note 11—income taxes for additional information 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest includes the net earnings attributable to the approximately 11 chs minority equity interest in cfn a subsidiary of cf holdings 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest increased 228 million or 198 to 343 million in 2021 compared to 115 million in 2020 due to higher earnings of cfn driven by higher average selling prices due primarily to a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance as higher global energy costs drove lower global operating rates 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders 

net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders increased 188 to 424 per diluted share in 2021 from 147 per diluted share in 2020 this increase is due primarily to higher operating results driven by an increase in gross margin partially offset by impairment charges related to our uk operations

antidumping and countervailing duty investigations 

on june 30 2021 we filed petitions with the us department of commerce commerce and the us international trade commission itc requesting the initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty investigations on imports of uan from russia and trinidad on august 13 2021 the itc made an affirmative preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that the us uan industry is materially injured by reason of imports of uan from russia and trinidad 

on november 30 2021 commerce announced preliminary countervailing duty determinations finding that uan imports from russia are unfairly subsidized at rates ranging from 966 to 984 and uan imports from trinidad are unfairly subsidized at a rate of 183 and imposed preliminary cash deposit requirements on those imports 

on january 27 2022 commerce announced preliminary antidumping duty determinations finding that russian uan imports are dumped ie sold at less than fair value into the us market at rates ranging from 915 to 12719 and that trinidadian uan imports are dumped at a rate of 6308 and imposed preliminary cash deposit requirements on those imports 

we expect that commerce will issue final determinations later in 2022 and if any of commerce’s final determinations are affirmative the itc would make a final determination as to whether the unfairly traded imports materially injure or threaten material injury to the us uan industry if the itc makes affirmative final determinations then commerce can impose duties equal to the level of dumping and unfair subsidies it finds at this time we cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings including whether final antidumping or countervailing duties will be imposed on imports from either russia or trinidad or the rate of any such duties

capital spending 

we make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base increase our capacity or capabilities improve plant efficiency and comply with various environmental health and safety requirements capital expenditures totaled 514 million in 2021 compared to 309 million in 2020 the increase in capital expenditures reflects higher capital spending due to maintenance deferred from 2020 as well as activity that was previously planned to occur in 2022 but accelerated into 2021 

capital expenditures in 2022 are estimated to be in the range of 500 to 550 million which includes capital expenditures at our donaldsonville complex related to green and blue ammonia projects planned capital expenditures are generally subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting unanticipated increases in cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties delays in the receipt of equipment adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties 

government policies 

the policies or laws of governments around the world can result in the imposition of taxes duties tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world the policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers or farmers due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic political and social objectives additionally the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity the impact of changes in governmental policies or laws or the political or social objectives of a country could have a material impact on fertilizer demand and selling prices and therefore could impact our liquidity 

emission credit activity 

our uk manufacturing plants are subject to greenhouse gas ghg regulations in the united kingdom after the united kingdom’s exit from the european union the uk government instituted new ghg regulations in 2021 including establishing the uk emission trading scheme uk ets the uk ets replaces the european union emissions trading system for uk companies in conjunction with these changes the uk ghg regulations established a lower emission cap than applied to us under the european ghg regulations under the new uk requirements we are required to obtain and surrender emission allowances equivalent to our annual greenhouse gas emissions although we are also allocated a certain number of free allowances as a result of the new ghg regulations and the establishment of the uk ets our remaining european union emission credits were no longer applicable for us in the united kingdom and we need uk emission credits to offset any emissions that are in excess of the number of free allowances allocated to us accordingly in the third quarter of 2021 we sold our remaining eu emission credits for approximately 20 million and recognized a corresponding gain as the credits were earned by us in prior years due to approved emission abatement actions that we had taken and therefore did not have a recognized cost associated with them we subsequently purchased approximately 321000 of uk emission credits for approximately 19 million during the fourth quarter of 2021 as we have estimated that we have sufficient emission credits for our 2021 obligations we sold the excess uk emission credits including those purchased in the third quarter of 2021 for approximately 46 million and recognized a corresponding gain of 27 million

canada revenue agency competent authority matter 

in 2016 the canada revenue agency cra and alberta tax and revenue administration alberta tra issued notices of reassessment for tax years 2006 through 2009 to one of our canadian affiliates asserting a disallowance of certain patronage allocations we filed notices of objection with respect to the notices of reassessment with the cra and alberta tra and posted letters of credit in lieu of paying the additional tax liability assessed the letters of credit serve as security until the matter is resolved in 2018 the matter including the related transfer pricing topic was accepted for consideration under the bilateral settlement provisions of the uscanada tax treaty the treaty by the united states and canadian competent authorities and included tax years 2006 through 2011 in the second quarter of 2021 the company entered the transfer pricing aspect of the matter into the arbitration process under the terms of the treaty 

in february 2022 we were informed that a decision was reached by the arbitration board regarding the transfer pricing matter with the cra for tax years 2006 through 2011 as discussed in note 11—income taxes we are awaiting further details of the results of the arbitration proceedings and the settlement provisions between the united states and canadian competent authorities we need to decide whether to accept the decision of the arbitration board or pursue other resolution alternatives which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2022 

if we were to accept the decision of the arbitration board the associated letters of credit would be cancelled and we would owe additional tax and interest to canada which would likely be due in the second quarter of 2022 simultaneously pursuant to the arbitration determination the company would file amended tax returns for the relevant tax years with the united states to request a refund of tax overpaid the receipt of tax overpaid and any related interest would occur in a period later than the settlement of tax and interest owed while we are not currently able to estimate the amounts due to or to be received from the taxing jurisdictions each of the individual amounts that would ultimately be paid or received could be material 

terra amended tax returns 

in 2020 we received us federal income tax refunds including interest of 110 million relating to amended tax returns that we had filed in 2012 related to prior tax years see discussion under “items affecting comparability of results—terra amended tax returns” above for further information 

in 2017 we made a voluntary disclosures program filing with the cra with respect to the canadian tax aspects of the amended us tax returns and paid additional canadian taxes due in late 2020 the cra settled with us the voluntary disclosure matter and in the first quarter of 2021 we received approximately 20 million of withholding tax refunds including interest from the cra these amounts were previously recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

we have operations in canada the united kingdom and a 50 interest in a joint venture in the republic of trinidad and tobago historically the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us were recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings were recognized unless the earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested based upon our then current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurred at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings could occur in different periods 

in light of changes made by the tax cuts and jobs act commencing with the 2018 tax year the united states no longer taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries even when such earnings are earned or repatriated to the united states unless such earnings are subject to us rules on passive income or certain antiabuse provisions foreign subsidiary earnings may still be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated to the united states 

cash balances held by our joint venture are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint venture on a periodic basis 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 205 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 163 billion was held by our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries historically and for the current year the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represented accumulated earnings of our foreign operations that were not considered to be permanently reinvested as of december 31 2021 we would not expect any additional cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian and united kingdom cash balances if we were to repatriate this cash in the future other than foreign withholding tax

forward sales and customer advances 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose therefore our reported nitrogen fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contract’s value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time control transfers to the customer thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until control transfers and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had 700 million and 130 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets 

while customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers’ outlook of future market fundamentals during periods of declining prices customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the 

cf industries holdings inc 

current prices if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase additionally borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity 

under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customer’s inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales 

natural gas 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen products we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other products expenditures on natural gas are a significant portion of our production costs representing approximately 40 of our total production costs in 2021 as a result of these factors natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity 

we enter into agreements for a portion of our future natural gas supply and related transportation as of december 31 2021 our natural gas purchase agreements have terms that range from one to two years and a total minimum commitment of approximately 780 million and our natural gas transportation agreements have terms that range from one to ten years and a total minimum commitment of approximately 165 million our minimum commitments to purchase and transport natural gas are based on prevailing marketbased forward prices excluding reductions for plant maintenance and turnaround activities 

because most of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america have declined in the last decade but are subject to volatility during 2021 the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 236 per mmbtu on april 7 2021 and a high of 2361 per mmbtu on february 18 2021 during the threeyear period ended december 31 2021 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 134 per mmbtu on september 22 2020 and three consecutive days in october 2020 and a high of 2361 per mmbtu on february 18 2021 

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2021 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 558 per mmbtu on february 23 2021 and a high of 6010 per mmbtu on december 22 2021 during the threeyear period ended december 31 2021 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 104 per mmbtu on may 22 2020 and a high of 6010 per mmbtu on december 22 2021 

natural gas costs in our cost of sales including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives increased 88 to 421 per mmbtu in 2021 from 224 per mmbtu in 2020 

derivative financial instruments 

we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for our nitrogenbased products from time to time we may also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives in 2021 and 2020 we recognized an unrealized net marktomarket loss gain on natural gas derivatives of 25 million and 6 million respectively which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 

derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks other major financial institutions or large energy companies and the use of international swaps and derivatives association isda master netting arrangements the isda agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for overthecounter derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk in part by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement 

the isda agreements for most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions in the event of certain defaults or termination events our counterparties may request early termination and 

cf industries holdings inc 

net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 31 million and 6 million respectively which also approximates the fair value of the assets that may be needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates 

as of december 31 2021 our open natural gas derivative contracts consisted of natural gas fixed price swaps basis swaps and options for 600 million mmbtus as of december 31 2020 we had open natural gas derivative contracts consisting of natural gas fixed price swaps and basis swaps for 341 million mmbtus at both december 31 2021 and 2020 we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts the credit support documents executed in connection with certain of our isda agreements generally provide us and our counterparties the right to set off collateral against amounts owing under the isda agreements upon the occurrence of a default or a specified termination event 

embedded derivative liability 

under the terms of our strategic venture with chs if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels we are required to make a nonrefundable yearly payment of 5 million to chs since 2016 our credit ratings have been below certain levels and as a result we made an annual payment of 5 million to chs in the fourth quarter of each year these payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or february 1 2026 this obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as an embedded derivative as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the embedded derivative liability was 15 million and 18 million respectively see note 10—fair value measurements for additional information 

defined benefit pension plans 

we contributed 40 million to our pension plans in 2021 in 2022 we expect to contribute approximately 29 million to our pension plans in addition we expect to contribute a total of approximately 68 million to our uk plans in the threeyear period from 2023 to 2025 as agreed with the plans’ trustees

cash flows 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was 287 billion as compared to 123 billion in 2020 an increase of 164 billion the increase in cash flow from operations was due primarily to higher net earnings and favorable changes in net working capital net earnings in 2021 was 126 billion compared to 432 million in 2020 the increase in net earnings was due primarily to higher average selling prices and a 112 million gain on the net settlement of certain natural gas contracts with our suppliers in february 2021 partially offset by higher costs related to manufacturing maintenance and repair activity during 2021 net changes in working capital increased cash flow from operations by 448 million while in 2020 net changes in working capital contributed 12 million to cash flow from operations the increased cash flow from working capital changes was primarily driven by an increase in customer advances and accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by changes in accounts receivable and inventory 

cf industries holdings inc 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 466 million in 2021 compared to 299 million in 2020 or an increase of 167 million this increase was due primarily to higher capital expenditures during 2021 capital expenditures totaled 514 million compared to 309 million in 2020 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 146 billion in 2021 compared to 542 million in 2020 in 2021 we paid 518 million in connection with the redemption of the 2021 notes and the partial redemption of the 2023 notes in 2021 we repurchased shares of common stock for 540 million of which 1 million was accrued and unpaid as of december 31 2021 compared to share repurchases of 100 million in 2020 dividends paid on common stock in 2021 and 2020 were 260 million and 258 million respectively distributions to noncontrolling interest totaled 194 million in 2021 as compared to 174 million in 2020 

critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap us gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting estimates 

  recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include production and sales volumes selling prices raw material costs operating rates operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review 

the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment is less than its carrying value and the reduction in value is other than temporary the reduction in value would be recognized immediately in earnings 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further analysis is necessary however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test which involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount no further testing is necessary if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill impairment would be recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit we identified no goodwill impairment in 2020 or 2019

during the third quarter of 2021 in light of the unprecedented increase in natural gas prices in the united kingdom and its estimated impact on our uk operations we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill within our uk ammonia uk an and uk other reporting units due to the triggering event we performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment analysis as of september 30 2021 for our uk ammonia uk an and uk other reporting units we estimated the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach described in note 6—united kingdom energy crisis and impairment charges based on the evaluation performed we determined that the carrying value of all three reporting units exceeded their fair value which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge totaling 259 million in the third quarter of 2021 the goodwill impairment was calculated as the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit including any goodwill exceeded its fair value the continued impacts of the uk energy crisis in the fourth quarter of 2021 triggered an additional impairment test and we recognized an additional goodwill impairment charge of 26 million in 2021 we recognized total goodwill impairment charges of 285 million as of december 31 2021 after the recognition of the 285 million of goodwill impairment charges noted above we have no remaining goodwill related to our uk operations as of december 31 2021 the carrying value of our goodwill was 209 billion our annual evaluation of impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021 included a qualitative assessment for our north america reporting units where the remaining goodwill is allocated and resulted in no indication of impairment 

as a result of the triggering event described above we also performed a recoverability test on our longlived assets within the uk ammonia uk an and uk other asset groups including our definitelived intangible assets as of september 30 2021 the recoverability test was based on forecasts of undiscounted cash flows as described in note 6—united kingdom energy crisis and impairment charges the results of the recoverability test indicated that the longlived assets within our uk ammonia uk an and uk other asset groups were not fully recoverable and as a result longlived asset impairment charges inclusive of the definitelived intangible assets of 236 million were recorded that impairment was allocated to each of the underlying assets of which 50 million was allocated to definitelived intangible assets as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the carrying value of our intangible assets was 45 million and 104 million respectively 

as discussed above the results of our fourth quarter 2021 longlived asset impairment test indicated that no additional longlived asset impairment should be recorded as the undiscounted cash flows were in excess of the carrying values for each of the uk asset groups of the factors discussed above the assumptions for product selling prices and natural gas costs included in the expected cash flows utilized in the longlived asset impairment test were more sensitive than others assuming that all other assumptions utilized in our expected cash flows and the other inputs used in our longlived asset test remained unchanged a decrease of 500 per product ton in the average selling price or an increase of 050 per mmbtu in the cost of natural gas would have resulted in longlived asset impairment for certain of the uk asset groups as the undiscounted cash flows would have been lower than their carrying values and the resulting longlived asset impairment charges for the fourth quarter of 2021 would have been as follows   

1 the sensitivity impact of a 050mmbtu increase or decrease in the cost of natural gas includes any corresponding impact to selling prices from contractually stipulated sales provisions

plnl is our joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied under a gas sales contract the ngc contract by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method the joint venture experienced past curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which reduced the ammonia production at plnl the ngc contract had an initial expiration date of september 2018 and was extended on the same terms until september 2023 any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will be based on new agreements if ngc does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to plnl at prices that permit profitable operations plnl may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in plnl the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2021 is 82 million

projected benefit obligations 

the projected benefit obligations pbos for our defined benefit pension plans are affected by plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates key assumptions that affect our pbo are discount rates and in addition for our united kingdom plans inflation rates including an adjusted uk retail price index rpi 

the december 31 2021 pbo was computed based on a weightedaverage discount rate of 28 for our north america plans and 20 for our united kingdom plans which were based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 2021 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo for our united kingdom plans the 33 rpi used to calculate our pbo is developed using the bank of england implied retail price inflation curve which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and indexlinked government bonds 

for north america qualified pension plans our pbo was 841 million as of december 31 2021 which was 11 million higher than pension plan assets for our united kingdom pension plans our pbo was 590 million as of december 31 2021 which was 85 million higher than pension plan assets the tables below estimate the impact of a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the key assumptions on our december 31 2021 pbo

income taxes 

we are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate and we recognize expense assets and liabilities based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions these tax laws are complex and how they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation differences in interpretation of the tax laws and regulations including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimates the judgments made at a point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations and these changes could significantly impact the provision for income taxes the amount of taxes payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balances we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which these changes occur 

we also engage in a significant amount of cross border transactions the taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators across the globe including the jurisdictions in which we operate the tax rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various jurisdictions as a result there are instances where regulators within the jurisdictions involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances we work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to nitrogenbased products are sensitive to changes in selling prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea uan 32 and an by approximately 33 22 14 and 16 respectively 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased products at certain times we have managed the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivative instruments that we may use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps basis swaps and options these derivatives settle using primarily a nymex futures price index which represents the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods as of december 31 2021 we had natural gas derivative contracts covering certain periods through march 2022 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had open derivative contracts for 600 million mmbtus and 341 million mmbtus respectively a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas at december 31 2021 would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of 35 million and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by 35 million 

from time to time we may purchase nitrogen products on the open market to augment or replace production at our facilities 

interest rates 

as of december 31 2021 we had five series of senior notes totaling 350 billion of principal outstanding with maturity dates of june 1 2023 december 1 2026 march 15 2034 june 1 2043 and march 15 2044 the senior notes have fixed interest rates as of december 31 2021 the carrying value and fair value of our senior notes was approximately 347 billion and 411 billion respectively 

borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear current market rates of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2021 or 2020 maximum borrowings under the revolving credit agreement during 2020 were 500 million the weightedaverage annual interest rate of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement during 2020 was 205 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we are directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro we generally do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies

our commitment to a clean energy economy 

in october 2020 we announced that we are taking significant steps to support a global hydrogen and clean fuel economy through the production of green and lowcarbon ammonia since ammonia is one of the most efficient ways to transport and store hydrogen and is also a fuel in its own right we believe that the company as the world’s largest producer of ammonia with an unparalleled manufacturing and distribution network and deep technical expertise is uniquely positioned to fulfill anticipated demand for hydrogen and ammonia from green and lowcarbon sources our strategy is to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy our approach will focus on green ammonia production which refers to ammonia produced through a carbonfree process and lowcarbon ammonia which relates to ammonia produced by conventional processes but with co 2 removed through carbon capture and sequestration ccs and other certified carbon abatement projects we have announced an initial green ammonia project at our flagship donaldsonville nitrogen complex to produce approximately 20000 tons per year of green ammonia additionally we are developing ccs and other carbon abatement projects across our production facilities that will enable us to produce lowcarbon ammonia 

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as central farmers fertilizer company and were owned by a group of regional agriculture cooperatives for the first 59 years of our existence central farmers became cf industries in 1970 

originally established as a fertilizer brokerage company we expanded owning and operating fertilizer manufacturing and distribution facilities in the early 1950s with a principal objective of assured supply for our owners at various times in our history we manufactured andor distributed nitrogen phosphate and potash fertilizers 

we operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners’ equity interests in cf industries were canceled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock at the time of the ipo our assets consisted of one wholly owned nitrogen manufacturing facility in louisiana united states a joint venture nitrogen manufacturing facility in alberta canada of which we owned 66 percent a phosphate mining and manufacturing operation in florida united states and distribution facilities throughout north america 

in april 2010 we acquired terra industries inc terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities an approximately 753 interest in tnclp and certain joint venture interests 

in march 2014 we exited our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was located in florida through a sale to the mosaic company for approximately 14 billion in cash as a result our company became focused solely on nitrogen manufacturing and distribution 

in july 2015 we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk group limited formerly known as growhow uk group limited cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us for total consideration of 570 million and cf fertilisers uk became wholly owned by us this transaction added cf fertilisers uk’s nitrogen manufacturing complexes in ince united kingdom and billingham united kingdom to our consolidated manufacturing capacity 

in february 2016 our strategic venture with chs commenced at which time chs made a capital contribution of 28 billion to cfn in exchange for membership interests in cfn which represented approximately 11 of the total membership interests of cfn 

in late 2015 and 2016 we completed certain capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa these projects originally announced in 2012 included the construction of new ammonia urea and uan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex these plants increased our overall production capacity by approximately 25 improved our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville and improved our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location the total capital cost of the capacity expansion projects was 52 billion

prior to april 2 2018 terra nitrogen limited partnership which owns and operates our nitrogen manufacturing facility in verdigris oklahoma was a subsidiary of terra nitrogen company lp tnclp tnclp was a publicly traded limited partnership of which we were the sole general partner and the majority limited partner and in which we owned an approximate 753 interest 

in 2018 we announced that in accordance with the terms of tnclp’s first amended and restated agreement of limited partnership as amended by amendment no 1 to the first amended and restated agreement of limited partnership the tnclp agreement of limited partnership terra nitrogen gp inc tngp the sole general partner of tnclp and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of cf holdings elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4612562 publicly traded common units of tnclp the tnclp public units on april 2 2018 tngp completed its purchase of the tnclp public units the purchase for an aggregate cash purchase price of 388 million we funded the purchase with cash on hand upon completion of the purchase cf holdings owned through its subsidiaries 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of tnclp 

product tons and nutrient tons 

unless otherwise stated we measure our production and sales volume in this annual report on form 10k in product tons which represents the weight of the product measured in short tons one short ton is equal to 2000 pounds references to uan product tons assume a 32 nitrogen content basis for production volume 

we also provide certain supplementary volume information measured in nutrient tons nutrient tons represent the weight of the product’s nitrogen content which varies by product ammonia represents 82 nitrogen content granular urea represents 46 nitrogen content uan represents between 28 and 32 nitrogen content and an represents between 29 and 35 nitrogen content 

reportable segments 

our reportable segments consist of the following segments ammonia granular urea uan an and other these segments are differentiated by products we use gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources total other operating costs and expenses consisting of selling general and administrative expenses and other operating—net and nonoperating expenses interest and income taxes are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management see note 21—segment disclosures for additional information

point lisas trinidad 

the point lisas nitrogen facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago is owned jointly through a 5050 venture with koch fertilizer llc this facility has the capacity to produce 720000 tons of ammonia annually from natural gas supplied under a contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc 

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen manufacturing facilities in 2020 natural gas accounted for approximately onethird of our total production costs for nitrogen products our nitrogen manufacturing facilities have access to abundant competitivelypriced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities our facilities utilize the following natural gas hubs henry hub in louisiana sonat in louisiana tetco ela in louisiana oneok in oklahoma aeco in alberta ventura in iowa demarcation in kansas welcome in minnesota dawn in ontario parkway in ontario and the national balancing point nbp in the united kingdom 

in 2020 our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consumed in the aggregate approximately 365 million mmbtus of natural gas we employ a combination of daily spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced supply of natural gas we also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices see note 15—derivative financial instruments for additional information about our natural gas hedging activities 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the safe efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen products is critical for successful operations our nitrogen production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship products to terminals warehouses and customers each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location 

our north american nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and to our storage facilities in the us and canada with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5000 tank and hopper cars as well as railcars provided by rail carriers our united kingdom nitrogen production facilities mainly ship products via truck 

the north american waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our donaldsonville verdigris and yazoo city facilities to ship ammonia and uan we employ a fleet of ten tow boats and twentyeight river barges which are primarily leased we also utilize contract marine services to move urea fertilizer we can also export nitrogen fertilizer products via seagoing vessels from our donaldsonville yazoo city billingham and ince manufacturing facilities 

the donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2000mile long nustar pipeline through which we have the ability to transport ammonia to ten terminals and shipping points in the midwestern us corn belt

storage facilities and other properties 

as of december 31 2020 we owned or leased space at 63 inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 21state region of the united states canada and the united kingdom including storage at our production facilities we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately 32 million tons of product our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table 



 

1 capacity is expressed as the equivalent volume of uan measured on a 32 nitrogen content basis 

2 our lease agreements are typically for periods of one to five years 

customers 

the principal customers for our nitrogen products are cooperatives independent fertilizer distributors traders wholesalers and industrial users sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force chs was our largest customer in 2020 and accounted for approximately 13 of our consolidated net sales we have a strategic venture with chs under which chs has a minority equity interest in cfn see note 17—noncontrolling interests for additional information on our strategic venture with chs 

competition 

our markets are global and intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

our primary north americanbased competitors include nutrien ltd koch fertilizer llc and iowa fertilizer company there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition from foreignsourced products continuously 

our primary united kingdom competition comes from imported products supplied by companies including yara international origin fertilisers ameropa chs and helm urea and uan are not produced in the united kingdom but along with an are widelytraded fertilizer products with limited barriers to entry 

seasonality 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to weather conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other fertilizer producers generally manufacture and distribute products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom the european union and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act tsca the occupational safety and health act osha and various other federal state and local statutes violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment we may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future 

environmental health and safety expenditures 

our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2020 totaled approximately 40 million we estimate that we will have approximately 45 million of capital expenditures for environmental health and safety in 2021 in addition to support safe and reliable operations at our continuous process manufacturing facilities we conduct scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of our plant machinery and equipment which are referred to as turnarounds a further description of turnaround activities is included in note 6—property plant and equipment—net to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our manufacturing and distribution facilities such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cerclaremediation matters 

from time to time we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws in 2011 we received a notice from the idaho department of environmental quality ideq that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine site we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho the current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site based on a consent order entered into with ideq and the us forest service in 2014 we and the current property owner are currently conducting a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the site in 2015 we and several other parties received a notice that the us department of the interior and other trustees intend to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for 17 former phosphate mines in southeast idaho one of which is the former georgetown canyon mine see note 20—contingencies for additional information 

regulation of greenhouse gases 

we are subject to regulations in the united kingdom the european union canada and the united states concerning greenhouse gas ghg emissions 

the united kingdom has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas emission trading system eu ets our uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require these plants to purchase co 2 emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our uk sites have also been subject to the eu ets and have been required to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset ghg emissions notwithstanding the exit of the united kingdom from the european union brexit on january 31 2020 facilities in the united kingdom remained subject to the eu ets through the end of 2020 beginning on january 1 2021 our uk manufacturing plants became subject to the uk emissions trading scheme uk ets at least initially the uk ets is expected to be similar to the eu ets although the uk government has stated that it intends to establish an emissions cap that is lower than what it would have been had the united kingdom remained subject to the eu ets no agreement has been reached as to whether the uk ets will establish a linkage with the eu ets or other national emission trading systems 

cf industries holdings inc 

in canada we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canada’s national pollutant release inventory and ontario’s mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation in 2018 the federal greenhouse pollution pricing act came into effect pursuant to which environment and climate change canada eccc will implement the outputbased performance standard obps which is intended to function as a backstop to provincial greenhouse gas emissions regulations in june 2019 the eccc finalized the emission limits for carbon dioxide equivalent co 2 e emissions from nitrogen fertilizer products these emission limits are based on 95 of the average emissions intensity for the production of such products from all canadian nitrogen fertilizer plants reflecting that such products are deemed to be energyintensive and tradeexposed and thus subject to a less stringent emissions reduction requirement in the provinces and territories where the obps applies a facility whose carbon emissions exceed the applicable limits is required to offset emissions by obtaining and retiring surplus emission credits obtaining qualifying emissions offsets or paying a fee which for calendar year 2019 was cad 20 per ton of excess carbon dioxide equivalent and which fee increases by cad 10 per ton for each succeeding year through 2022 in december 2020 the canadian federal government announced that it intended to increase the price of excess emissions of co 2 e by cad 15 per ton for each year beginning in 2023 with the price of excess co 2 e emissions reaching cad 170 per ton by 2030 ontario saskatchewan and alberta are challenging whether the federal government has jurisdiction to impose a federal carbon price on the provinces and territories the saskatchewan court of appeal in may 2019 and the ontario court of appeal in june 2019 each held that the greenhouse pollution pricing act gppa was validly enacted under the canadian constitution while the alberta court of appeal ruled in february 2020 that the gppa was unconstitutional oral argument on the appeal of these decisions was heard by the supreme court of canada in september 2020 

in january 2017 ontario launched its own ghg cap and trade program and beginning january 1 2018 ontario’s cap and trade program was linked with the cap and trade programs in quebec and california our courtright nitrogen complex was subject to the ontario cap and trade program however the ontario government rescinded the cap and trade program in june 2018 because ontario no longer had a ghg regulatory regime the federal government imposed the obps in the province beginning in 2019 in july 2019 the new ontario government enacted a new ghg regulation called the emissionsperformance standards program eps that sets co 2 e emissions limits for nitrogen products based on a production weighted sectoral average for facilities whose carbon emissions exceed the applicable limits compliance options included the purchase of emissions performance units for a fee of cad 20 per ton of excess co 2 e for calendar year 2019 which fee rises by cad 10 per ton each year through 2022 except for registration and recordkeeping provisions the eps has not yet gone into effect in ontario and facilities in ontario are subject to the federal obps however in september 2020 eccc announced that the ontario eps met the federal government’s minimum stringency benchmark requirements and the federal carbon pricing system will no longer apply in ontario at a date to be set in consultation between eccc and the ontario government 

beginning in 2018 our medicine hat nitrogen complex became subject to the carbon competitiveness incentive regulation ccir this regulation establishes productspecific benchmarks based on the most efficient ghgemitting facilities in a sector a facility with emissions that exceeded the applicable benchmark was required to take action to reduce its ghg emissions intensity purchase emissions offsets or performance credits or make contributions to alberta’s climate fund in 2019 the alberta government passed the technology innovation and emission reduction implementation act tier which replaced the ccir and went into effect on january 1 2020 the tier requires large emitting facilities other than electricity producers which are subject to a different standard to comply with the least stringent of a “facilityspecific” benchmark of 90 of historical ghg emissions intensity from a threeyear baseline which intensity limit will be reduced by 1 a year beginning in 2021 or a benchmark reflecting the emissions intensity of the top 10 of facilities for a given sector the compliance options under the tier are similar to the compliance options under the ccir including initially establishing the price for payments into its carbon fund at cad 30 per excess ton of emissions the same effective price as set in the ccir the federal government had determined that alberta’s ccir meets its stringency requirements and did not impose the obps in 2019 in december 2019 the federal government determined that the tier also met the stringency requirements of the obps with respect to its regulation of large industrial emitters for 2020 the alberta government has announced that it will increase the levy for excess emissions of co 2 e from cad 30 per ton in 2020 by cad 10 per year up to cad 50 per ton in 2022 to match the price of carbon established in the obps 

in the united states ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels although some of the more significant developments to date including epa’s efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuelfired power plants do not directly impose obligations on our facilities the epa issued a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and reporting the previous year’s emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result are required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd construction permit applicable to such facilities we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to ghgs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects other than

on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement was accepted by the united states and ratified by canada and the united kingdom and went into effect in november 2016 the paris agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15°c above preindustrial levels each signatory is required to develop its own national plan to attain this objective increasing concern over the impacts of climate change is driving the signatories to establish even more ambitious ghg reduction targets in december 2020 the united kingdom announced a target to reduce ghg emission 68 from 1990 levels by 2030 the eu has announced a new target to reduce its ghg emission 55 below 1990 levels by 2030 on november 4 2019 the united states submitted formal notice of its withdrawal from the paris agreement which became effective on november 4 2020 but on january 20 2021 president biden announced that the united states has rejoined the paris agreement this will require the united states to submit its own national plan for reducing ghg emissions executive orders issued by the biden administration including in particular an executive order issued on january 27 2021 focusing on climate change evidence the administration’s intent to undertake numerous initiatives in an effort to reduce ghg emissions including promoting renewable energy development limiting or prohibiting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and in general making climate change considerations a critical component of federal policy 

new source performance standards for nitric acid plants 

we operate 14 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides nox notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas 

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals more stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits 

human capital resources 

our longterm success depends on our people we are dedicated to creating a workplace where employees are proud to work and grow and everyone feels empowered to do their best work we do this by investing in extensive recruitment training and professional development opportunities for our employees and fostering diversity and inclusion in our culture 

employee population we employed approximately 3000 employees at december 31 2020 of which 66 were located in the united states 20 in the united kingdom and 14 in canada as of december 31 2020 16 of our employees have worked for the company more than 20 years 16 of our employees have worked for the company between 11 and 20 years 27 of our employees have worked for the company between 6 and 10 years and 41 of our employees have worked at the company for less than 6 years fulltime employees represented approximately 99 of our workforce as of december 31 2020 and approximately 15 were covered by a collective bargaining agreement we supplement our workforce with contractors with specialized skill sets during periods of peak activity such as during turnarounds and maintenance events

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties individually or in combination could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

market risks 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand for nitrogen is affected by planted acreage crop selection and fertilizer application rates driven by population growth gross domestic product growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood use of crops such as production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things demand also includes industrial uses of nitrogen for example chemical manufacturing and emissions reductants such as diesel exhaust fluid def supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability energy prices government policies and global trade 

periods of strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to stimulate global investment in production capacity in recent years fertilizer producers including cf holdings have built new production facilities or expanded capacity of existing production assets or announced plans to do so the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply availability and affect the balance of supply and demand in certain years global nitrogen fertilizer capacity has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating a surplus of global nitrogen fertilizer capacity which led to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in 2016 and 2017 for example in the twoyear period ended december 31 2017 additional production capacity came on line and at the same time the average selling price for our products declined 34 from 314 per ton in 2015 to 207 per ton in 2017 

additional production capacity is expected to come on line over the next 12 months outside of north america we cannot predict the impact of this additional capacity also global or local economic and financial conditions or changes in such conditions or other factors may cause acceleration of other announced andor ongoing projects 

price fluctuations for our products result from changes in supply and demand significant price fluctuations we experience could be symptoms of an oversupplied market in transition as new capacity ramps up and production slows down or shuts down in high cost regions similarly lower energy prices can spur increases in production in high cost regions which would result in increased supply and pressure on selling prices additionally trade flows adjust as imports into different regions of the world also impact the local supply and demand balances if imports increase into an oversupplied region lower prices in that region could result 

during periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production in 2016 and 2017 our financial performance credit ratings and the trading price for our common stock were negatively impacted by the lower selling prices resulting from the global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer while in 2018 and 2019 we experienced increases in the average selling price for our products in 2020 the average selling price for our products decreased 14 to 203 per ton compared to 235 per ton in 2019 the period of time that these oversupply conditions can persist and the degree to which they will impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are uncertain 

our nitrogen products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers and related nitrogen products that we produce such as industrial grade ammonium nitrate and def are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent customer service and product quality as a consequence conditions in the international market for nitrogen products significantly influence our operating results 

we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of our competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities furthermore certain governments in some cases as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products or subsidize production or consumption in order to support domestic employment or other political or social 

cf industries holdings inc 

goals our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships 

china the world’s largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers currently has significant capacity surplus and many highcost plants as a result the domestic nitrogen industry in china is operating at less than full capacity if chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi the relaxation of chinese environmental standards or decreases in chinese producers’ underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage increased production capacity utilization any resulting export volume could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our competitors in russia continue to benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas allowing continued exports from the region and have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity the 2016 revocations of us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia have allowed for increases in imports from that country into the united states in recent years 

we also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe latin america and africa who depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the international market for nitrogen products is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen products into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate including the imposition of new duties tariffs or quotas that affect foreign trade and investment for example the imposition of duties tariffs or quotas in a region can directly impact product pricing in that region which can lead to changes in global trade flows and impact the global supply and demand balance and pricing market participants customarily move product between regions of the world or adjust trade flows in response to these factors north america where we manufacture and sell most of our products is one of the largest and most liquid nitrogen trading regions in the world as a result other manufacturers traders and other market participants can move nitrogen products to north america when there is uncertainty associated with the supply and demand balance in other regions or when duties tariffs or quotas impact prices or trade flows in other regions as a result duties tariffs and quotas can lead to uncertainty in the global marketplace and impact the supply and demand balance in many regions which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows on october 9 2019 the european commission the commission imposed definitive antidumping duties on imports to the european union of uan manufactured in russia the republic of trinidad and tobago and the united states for imports of uan manufactured in the united states the fixed duty rate is €2948 per metric ton or €2674 per ton the duties will remain in place for an initial fiveyear period after which the measures may be renewed by the commission the long term impact of this duty on the international market for nitrogen products is uncertain 

a decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the demand for our products 

conditions in the united states europe india brazil china and other global agricultural areas significantly impact our operating results agricultural planted areas and production can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices crop disease andor livestock disease demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding production of or trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control 

governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies commodity support programs and tariffs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand representing approximately 35 of total us corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production various interested parties have called to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol gasoline and corn lower gasoline prices and fewer aggregate miles driven by increased automobile fuel efficiency or the continued expansion of electric 

cf industries holdings inc 

vehicles may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand 

developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate or nitrogenefficient varieties or developments in alternatives to traditional animal feed or alternative proteins could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products widespread adoption of emerging application technologies or alternative farming techniques could disrupt traditional application practices affecting the volume or types of products used and timing of applications in addition from time to time various foreign government and us state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment for example the united kingdom is currently consulting with stakeholders and reviewing proposals to limit emissions from solid urea fertilizers including a potential ban on urea fertilizers while cf fertilisers uk limited does not sell solid urea fertilizer in the united kingdom other jurisdictions may consider limits on fertilizer use such as the european union which announced its farm to fork and biodiversity strategies any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including as a result of technological developments andor limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is dependent on natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility 

nitrogen from the atmosphere and hydrogen from natural gas coal and other carbon energy feedstocks or from the electrolysis of water are the fundamental building blocks of nitrogen fertilizers energy feedstock costs comprise a significant portion of the total production cost of nitrogen products and relative to the industry’s marginal producers that set the global price of nitrogen generally determine profitability for nitrogen producers our manufacturing processes utilize natural gas as the principal raw material used in our production of nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea urea ammonium nitrate solution uan ammonium nitrate an and other nitrogen products 

most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada as a result north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products in recent years the cost of north american natural gas for the production of nitrogen fertilizers has been significantly lower than the energy costs of the industry’s marginal nitrogen producers changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to extended periods of higher natural gas prices if high natural gas prices were to persist in north america and significantly erode our favorable energy cost differentials relative to the marginal nitrogen producers it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2020 the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 134 per mmbtu on september 22 2020 and three consecutive days in october and a high of 308 per mmbtu on october 27 2020 during the threeyear period ended december 31 2020 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 134 per mmbtu on september 22 2020 and three consecutive days in october 2020 and a high of 688 per mmbtu on january 4 2018 

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe which has also been volatile in recent years the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2020 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 104 per mmbtu on may 22 2020 and a high of 771 per mmbtu on december 30 2020 during the threeyear period ended december 31 2020 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 104 per mmbtu on may 22 2020 and a high of 3174 per mmbtu on march 2 2018 

the price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices resulting in production of less associated gas 

certain of our operating facilities are located near natural gas hubs that have experienced increased natural gas development and have favorable basis differences as compared to other north american hubs favorable basis differences in certain regions may dissipate over time due to increases in natural gas pipeline or storage capacity in those regions additionally basis differentials may become materially unfavorable due to a lack of inbound gas pipeline or storage capacity in other regions during periods of unusually high demand increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production increased demand or changes in basis were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the

supply and demand balance for natural gas in north america or elsewhere natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations 

weather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting growing harvesting or application periods may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following application period resulting in lower seasonal demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions during or following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers adverse weather conditions could also impact transportation of fertilizer which could disrupt our ability to deliver our products to customers on a timely basis our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in fertilizer applications planting schedules and purchasing patterns over the longerterm changes in weather patterns may shift the periods of demand for products and even the regions to which our products are distributed which could require us to evolve our distribution system 

in addition we use the north american waterway system extensively to ship products from some of our manufacturing facilities to our distribution facilities and our customers and we also export nitrogen fertilizer products via seagoing vessels from deepwater docking facilities at certain of our manufacturing sites therefore persistent significant changes in river or ocean water levels either up or down such as a result of flooding or drought for example may require changes to our operating and distribution activities andor significant capital improvements to our facilities 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can disrupt our operations and can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products colder andor longer than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events can not only cause loss of power at our facilities disrupting our operations but also can impact the supply of natural gas and utilities and cause prices to rise 

our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other fertilizer producers generally manufacture and distribute products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application seasons and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season 

if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations would be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price could be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results 

a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity by reducing our working capital needs due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product 

cf industries holdings inc 

and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assets 

any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months 

we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

operational risks 

our operations are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and any delay or interruption in the delivery of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas and other raw materials in the manufacture of nitrogen products we purchase the natural gas and other raw materials from third party suppliers our natural gas is transported by pipeline to our facilities by third party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties delays or interruptions in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials may be caused by among other things severe weather or natural disasters unscheduled downtime labor difficulties insolvency of our suppliers or their inability to meet existing contractual arrangements deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents or mechanical failures in addition the transport of natural gas by pipeline is subject to additional risks including delays or interruptions caused by capacity constraints leaks or ruptures any delay or interruption in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials even for a limited period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers and are subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight this exposes us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to additional liability 

we rely on natural gas pipelines to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities in addition we rely on railroad barge truck vessel and pipeline companies to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages shutdowns delays accidents such as spills and derailments vessel groundings and other accidents and operating hazards additionally due to the aging infrastructure of certain rail lines bridges roadways pipelines river locks and equipment that our third party service providers utilize we may experience delays in both the receipt of raw materials or the shipment of finished product while repairs maintenance or replacement activities are conducted also certain third party service providers such as railroads have experienced periodic service delays or shutdowns due to capacity constraints in their systems operational and maintenance difficulties blockades weather or safetyrelated embargoes and delays and other events which could impact the shipping of our products and cause disruption in our supply chain 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents discharges or other releases of hazardous substances terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives governmental entities could implement new or more stringent regulatory requirements affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products 

if shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies’ failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements were implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there were significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

in the united states and canada the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads’ potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads shift liability to shippers by contract purport to shift liability to shippers by tariff or otherwise seek to require shippers to indemnify and defend the railroads from and against liabilities including in negligence strict liability or statutory liability that may arise from certain acts or omissions of the railroads third parties who may have insufficient resources or the company unknown causes or acts of god these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads third parties or us for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new or more stringent regulatory requirements also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products restrictions on service increases in transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors and any railroad industry initiatives that may impact our ability to transport our products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems and any technology disruption or cybersecurity incident could negatively affect our operations 

we rely on internal and thirdparty information technology and computer control systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications the management of our accounting financial and supply chain functions and plant operations if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach in addition our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees business partners customers or suppliers and may subject us to legal liability 

as with most large systems our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyber attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase to date we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations at one or more sites delay production and shipments result in the theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation result in legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy or other laws or increased costs for security and remediation or raise concerns regarding our accounting for transactions each of these consequences could adversely affect our business reputation and our financial statements 

our business involves the use storage and transmission of information about our employees customers and suppliers the protection of such information as well as our proprietary information is critical to us the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements we have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our employees customers or suppliers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us or our employees customers suppliers or other individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability these events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities 

our nitrogen fertilizer operations are located at nine separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represented approximately 40 of our ammonia production capacity as of december 31 2020 the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows operational disruptions could occur for many reasons including natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance and other manufacturing problems disease strikes or other labor unrest or transportation interruptions for example our 

cf industries holdings inc 

donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane or high wind activity and several of our complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to affect adversely the shipping and distribution of our products moreover our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace or have long delivery lead times due in part to a limited number of suppliers and could result in operational disruptions 

acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives we are subject to various security laws and regulations in the united states these security laws include the maritime transportation security act of 2002 and the chemical facilities antiterrorism standards regulation in addition president obama issued in 2013 executive order 13650 improving chemical facility safety and security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen products that can be used as explosives it is possible that governmental entities in the united states or elsewhere could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen products thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for us 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations 

our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions 

changes in governmental trade policies can lead to the imposition of new taxes levies duties tariffs or quotas affecting agricultural commodities fertilizer or industrial products these can alter costs trade flows access to supplies or demand and regional balances for our products 

our principal reporting currency is the us dollar and our business operations and investments outside the united states increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change we may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by among other things requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in or indexed to the us dollar or a currency freely convertible into us dollars or hedging through foreign currency derivatives these efforts however may not be effective and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs in various jurisdictions including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 the canadian corruption of foreign public officials act and economic sanctions programs administered by the united nations the european union and the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury and regulations set forth under the comprehensive iran accountability divestment act as a result of doing business internationally we are exposed to a risk of violating anticorruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we our partners or agents operate violations of anticorruption and sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and termination of existing contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment the violation of applicable laws by our employees consultants agents or partners could subject us to penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation administration and enforcement will change over time changes in antitrust laws globally or in their interpretation administration or enforcement may limit our existing or future operations and growth 

financial risks 

our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacture transportation storage and distribution of chemical products including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled plant downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations for an extended period of time andor the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to various selfinsured retentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfinsured retentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage there can be no assurance that we will be able to buy and maintain insurance with adequate limits and reasonable pricing terms and conditions 

in april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities were named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases were consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption “in re west explosion cases” the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325 individuals and 80 insurance companies plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities manufactured and sold to others were delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident the court granted in part and denied in part the cf entities’ motions for summary judgment in august 2015 over three hundred cases have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements that have been or we expect will be fully funded by insurance the remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pretrial proceedings the next group of cases is expected to be set for trial after the court resumes scheduling civil jury trials currently on hold because of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic we believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the cf entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits the increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilities

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow prevent us from fulfilling our obligations and impair our ability to pursue or achieve other business objectives 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 40 billion of total funded indebtedness consisting primarily of secured and unsecured senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2021 and 2044 or approximately 40 of our total capitalization and an additional 750 million of senior secured borrowing availability reflecting no outstanding borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit for general corporate purposes under our senior secured revolving credit agreement as amended the revolving credit agreement our substantial debt service obligations will have an impact on our earnings and cash flow for so long as the indebtedness is outstanding 

our substantial indebtedness could as a result of our debt service obligations or through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it could 

• make it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us not to have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments 

• cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions 

• cause us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital and capital expenditures and other business activities 

• cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our revolving credit agreement could be at variable rates of interest 

• make us more leveraged than some of our competitors which could place us at a competitive disadvantage 

• restrict our ability to dispose of assets or otherwise restrict our use of funds from the disposal of assets 

• restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or utilize excess cash to repurchase shares of our common stock 

• limit our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and 

• result in a downgrade in the credit rating of our indebtedness which could increase the cost of further borrowings 

we expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future if we incur additional indebtedness the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could intensify if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate our relations with our creditors including the holders of our outstanding debt securities the lenders under our revolving credit agreement and our suppliers may be materially and adversely affected 

a failure to satisfy the financial maintenance covenants under our revolving credit agreement or a breach of the covenants under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness could limit the borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement or result in an event of default under such agreements 

our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness including the consolidated interest coverage ratio and consolidated net leverage ratio maintenance covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement will depend upon our future performance and various other factors such as market prices for our nitrogen products natural gas prices and other business competitive and regulatory factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to maintain compliance with all of these covenants in that event we may not be able to access the borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement and we would need to seek an amendment to our debt agreements or would need to refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we can obtain future amendments or waivers of our debt agreements and instruments or refinance our debt and even if we were able to do so such relief might only last for a limited period potentially necessitating additional amendments waivers or refinancings any noncompliance by us with the covenants under our debt agreements and instruments could result in an event of default under those debt agreements and instruments an event of default under an agreement or instrument governing any of our indebtedness may allow our creditors to accelerate the 

cf industries holdings inc 

related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if our lenders or holders of our debt securities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we may be forced to liquidate certain assets to repay all or part of our indebtedness which could materially and adversely impair our business operations an event of default under our revolving credit agreement would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under our revolving credit agreement furthermore our revolving credit agreement and senior secured notes provide for liens on specified collateral to secure our obligations thereunder and if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under our revolving credit agreement or the senior secured notes our revolving credit agreement lenders or holders of the senior secured notes as applicable could proceed against the collateral granted to them which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness we cannot assure that we would have sufficient assets to make such repayment 

potential future downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital cause vendors to change their credit terms for doing business with us and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

as of february 16 2021 our corporate credit rating by sp global ratings is bb with a stable outlook our corporate credit rating by moody’s investor services inc is ba1 with a stable outlook and our corporate credit rating with fitch ratings inc is bb with a stable outlook 

these ratings and our current credit condition affect among other things our ability to access new capital especially debt as well as the payment terms that vendors are willing to provide us negative changes in these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt and could cause vendors to shorten our payment terms require us to pay in advance for materials or services or provide letters of credit security or other credit enhancements in order to do business with us 

tax matters including changes in tax laws or rates adverse determinations by taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in i the united states where most of our operations are located and ii numerous foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized or conduct business tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rate could also be affected by changes in our mix of earnings from countries with differing statutory tax rates and tax systems changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have used the cash we generate outside the united states primarily to fund development of our business in nonus jurisdictions if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the united states we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the united states under the tax laws of the foreign countries in which we operate those international earnings could be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated therefore the repatriation of those earnings could result in an increase in our worldwide effective tax rate and an increase in our use of cash to pay these taxes 

we also need to comply with other new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs or value added taxes or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the united states and other countries in which we operate are in the process of implementing the organization for economic cooperation and development’s oecd base erosion and profit shifting project beps beps is intended to improve tax disclosure and transparency and eliminate structures and activities that could be perceived by a particular country as resulting in tax avoidance the oecd is currently developing a framework in order to assist member countries in adopting beps related legislation each country is permitted to introduce its own legislation to implement beps legislation as a number of our business operations do business across country lines we are subject to beps the implementation of beps could result in tax changes and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes results of operations and cash flows in some cases beps legislation could result in double taxation in a portion of our profits without an appropriate mechanism to recover the incremental tax amount in another jurisdiction

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives and the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses 

we may utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased products we have used natural gas futures swaps and option contracts traded in overthecounter markets or on exchanges we have also used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts to hedge our exposure to natural gas price volatility in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may from time to time use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts 

our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidity 

hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies 

our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments or by the triggering of any cross default provisions or credit support requirements against us additionally the international swaps and derivative association master netting arrangements for most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position 

at other times we may not utilize derivatives or derivative strategies to hedge certain risks or to reduce the financial exposure of price volatility as a result we may not prevent certain material adverse impacts that could have been mitigated through the use of derivative strategies 

environmental and regulatory risks 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws regulations and permitting requirements as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom the european union the republic of trinidad and tobago and other locations including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international laws 

as a producer of nitrogen fertilizer products working with hazardous substances our business faces risks of spills discharges or other releases of those substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current facilities or facilities previously owned by us or other acquired businesses adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental health and safety laws change regularly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental health and safety laws and regulations we may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

from time to time our production distribution or storage of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our operations andor resulted in liability for administrative penalties andor claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion or modification of our operations is predicated upon securing necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval or a determination that we have violated a law or permit as a result of a governmental inspection of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at our facilities and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we are subject to ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states in the united states our existing facilities currently are only subject to ghg emissions reporting obligations although new facilities that we build or existing facilities that we modify in the future could be subject to ghg emissions standards included in their air permits our facilities in the united kingdom have been subject to the european union emissions trading system eu ets which generally required us to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset ghg emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program notwithstanding the exit of the united kingdom from the european union brexit on january 31 2020 facilities in the united kingdom remained subject to the eu ets through the end of 2020 beginning on january 1 2021 our uk manufacturing plants became subject to the uk emissions trading scheme uk ets at least initially the uk ets is expected to be similar to the eu ets although the uk government has stated that it intends to establish an emissions cap that is lower than what it would have been had the united kingdom remained subject to the eu ets no agreement has been reached as to whether the uk ets will establish a linkage with the eu ets or other national emission trading systems our medicine hat nitrogen complex in alberta canada and our courtright nitrogen complex in ontario canada are subject to provincial or federal laws that impose a price on excess ghg emissions each of these laws establishes carbon dioxide equivalent co 2 e emissions standards applicable to our facilities in terms of emissions per unit of production with the provincial laws and the federal law using different formulas for establishing these intensity limits and changes in these limits over time if co 2 e emissions exceed the applicable limits the excess emissions must be offset either through obtaining qualifying emission credits or offsets or by making a payment for each ton of excess emissions the canadian federal government has announced that it intends to increase the price of excess emissions of co 2 e from cad 40 per ton in 2021 and cad 50 per ton in 2022 by cad 15 per ton each year beginning in 2023 with the price of excess co 2 e emissions reaching cad 170 per ton by 2030 

on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement was accepted by the united states and ratified by canada and the united kingdom and went into effect in november 2016 the paris agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15ºc above preindustrial levels each signatory is required to develop its own national plan to attain this objective increasing concern over the impacts of climate change is driving the signatories to establish ever more ambitious ghg reduction targets in december 2020 the united kingdom announced a target to reduce ghg emission 68 from 1990 levels by 2030 the eu has announced a new target to reduce its ghg emission 55 below 1990 levels by 2030 on november 4 2019 the united states submitted formal notice of its withdrawal from the paris agreement which became effective on november 4 2020 but on january 20 2021 president biden announced that the united states has rejoined the paris agreement this will require the united states to submit its own national plan for reducing ghg emissions executive orders issued by the biden administration including in particular an executive order issued on january 27 2021 focusing on climate change evidence the administration’s intent to undertake numerous initiatives in an effort to reduce ghg emissions including promoting renewable energy development limiting or prohibiting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and in general making climate change considerations a critical component of federal policy 

more stringent ghg regulations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg

strategic risks 

the market for green and lowcarbon ammonia may be slow to develop may not develop to the size expected or may not develop at all moreover we may not be successful in the development and implementation of our green and lowcarbon ammonia projects in a timely or economic manner or at all due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

the market for green and lowcarbon ammonia is developing and evolving may not develop to the size or at the rate we expect and is dependent in part on the developing market for green and lowcarbon hydrogen these markets are heavily influenced by federal state and local government laws regulations and policies concerning carbon emissions and clean energy in the united states and abroad 

we believe the demand for green and lowcarbon ammonia will take several years to fully develop and mature and we cannot be certain that this market or the market for green and lowcarbon hydrogen will grow to the size or at the rate we expect hydrogen currently only accounts for less than 1 of the world’s energy needs 

the recognition and acceptance of green and lowcarbon ammonia as a transport and storage mechanism for green and lowcarbon hydrogen the use of green and lowcarbon ammonia as a fuel in its own right and the development and growth of end market demand and applications for green and lowcarbon hydrogen and green and lowcarbon ammonia are uncertain and dependent on a number of factors outside of our control these factors include among others the extent to which and rate at which cost competitive global renewable energy capacity increases the pricing of alternative sources of energy the realization of technological improvements required to increase the efficiency and lower the costs of production of green and lowcarbon ammonia the regulatory environment the rate and extent of infrastructure investment and developments the availability of tax benefits and other incentives and our ability to provide green and lowcarbon ammonia offerings costeffectively if a sustainable market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate we may decide not to implement or may not be successful in implementing one or more elements of our multiyear strategic plan and commitment to a clean fuel economy 

our clean energy strategy also depends on the realization of certain technical improvements required to increase the efficiency and lower the costs of production of green and lowcarbon ammonia over time as we seek to convert additional existing production facilities and further expand our green ammonia and lowcarbon ammonia production capacity we may face operational difficulties and execution risks related to the design development and construction if our assumptions about the engineering and process characteristics necessary to successfully build the facility capacity that we are contemplating and to scale up to larger production quantities prove to be incorrect we may be unable to produce substantial quantities of green or lowcarbon ammonia and the cost to construct or convert such green and lowcarbon ammonia facilities or the production costs associated with the operation of such facilities may be higher than we project 

we may not be successful in the expansion of our business 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both within the united states and elsewhere major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments such as our green and lowcarbon ammonia projects require significant managerial resources the diversion of which from our other activities or opportunities may impair the existing operations of our business we may be unable to identify or successfully compete for certain acquisition targets which may hinder or prevent us from acquiring a target or completing other transactions the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or business combination transactions are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented in addition these efforts may require capital resources that could otherwise be used for the improvement and expansion of our existing business as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments among the risks associated with the pursuit and consummation of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments or business combinations are those involving 

• difficulties in integrating the parties’ operations systems technologies products and personnel 

• incurrence of significant transactionrelated expenses 

• potential integration or restructuring costs

• exposure to unanticipated liabilities 

• differences in the parties’ internal control environments which may require significant time and resources to resolve in conformity with applicable legal and accounting standards 

• increased scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 

• the tax effects of any such transaction and 

• the potential for costly and timeconsuming litigation including stockholder lawsuits 

in addition major capital projects may be dependent on the availability and performance of engineering firms construction firms equipment suppliers transportation providers and other vendors necessary to design and implement those projects on a timely basis and on acceptable terms major investments such as capital improvements at our facilities are subject to a number of risks any of which could prevent us from completing capital projects in a timely or economic manner or at all including without limitation cost overruns nonperformance of third parties the inability to obtain necessary permits or other permitting matters adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor and raw material shortages transportation constraints engineering and construction change orders errors in design construction or startup and other unforeseen difficulties 

international acquisitions partnerships joint ventures investments or business combinations and other international expansions of our business involve additional risks and uncertainties including but not limited to 

• the impact of particular economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

• challenges caused by distance and by language and cultural differences 

• difficulties and costs of complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations 

• unexpected changes in regulatory environments 

• political and economic instability including the possibility for civil unrest 

• nationalization of properties by foreign governments 

• tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements

covid19 pandemic risk 

our business and operations may be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the outbreak and pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows the rapid spread of covid19 has resulted in governmental authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns even though our business operations are designated as part of the critical infrastructure by the united states united kingdom and canadian governments and the governments of the states and provinces in which we operate these measures have impacted and may further impact all or portions of our workforce and operations if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions facility closures or other restrictions we may be unable to meet customer demand or perform fully under our contracts 

in addition our customers suppliers and third party service providers including transportation providers have been or may be in the future affected by covid19 including by the impact of measures taken by federal and local governments to slow the spread of the virus any negative impacts on our customers suppliers and third party service providers could negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows for example global demand for nitrogen for industrial use has been negatively affected by the pandemic and we expect this to continue as long as economic activity remains low due to the impacts of the pandemic restrictions on or disruptions of transportation port closures or increased border controls or closures or other impacts on domestic and global supply chains or distribution channels could increase our costs limit our ability to meet customer demand or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has reduced and may further reduce the demand for energy including crude oil as well as natural gas and coal which are nitrogen feedstocks reduced demand for nitrogen feedstocks has reduced and could further reduce the cost of nitrogen production outside of north america increasing global nitrogen supply and reducing the market prices of our products lower demand for crude oil could also reduce the supply and therefore increase the cost of natural gas which is the principal raw material used in our production of nitrogen fertilizers in addition lower crude oil prices and a reduced demand for gasoline resulting from actions to slow the spread of covid19 have reduced ethanol production and therefore negatively impacted the demand for corn which is a significant factor driving customer demand for our nitrogen fertilizers the pandemic has also disrupted traditional food supply chains which may have a material impact on livestock and food demand including the demand for corn each of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

while the covid19 pandemic did not have a material adverse effect on our reported results for the year ended december 31 2020 we are unable to predict the ultimate impact it may have on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows the extent to which our operations may be impacted by covid19 will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted including the further spread of the virus the duration of the covid19 outbreak and the type and duration of actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak the pandemic significantly increased global market uncertainty and caused an economic slowdown which resulted in a global recession persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

litigation 

west fertilizer co 

on april 17 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities were named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases were consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption “in re west explosion cases” the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325 individuals and 80 insurance companies plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities manufactured and sold to others were delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident 

the court granted in part and denied in part the cf entities’ motions for summary judgment in august 2015 over three hundred cases have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements that have been or we expect will be fully funded by insurance the remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pretrial proceedings the next group of cases is expected to be set for trial after the court resumes scheduling civil jury trials currently on hold because of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic we believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the cf entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits the company cannot provide a range of reasonably possible loss due to the uncertain nature of this litigation including uncertainties around the potential allocation of responsibility by a jury to other defendants or responsible third parties the recognition of a potential loss in the future in the west fertilizer co litigation could negatively affect our results in the period of recognition however based upon currently available information including available insurance coverage we do not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

• an extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern united states and 

• a 50 interest in point lisas nitrogen limited plnl an ammonia production joint venture located in the republic of trinidad and tobago that we account for under the equity method 

our commitment to a clean energy economy 

in october 2020 we announced that we are taking significant steps to support a global hydrogen and clean fuel economy through the production of green and lowcarbon ammonia since ammonia is one of the most efficient ways to transport and store hydrogen and is also a fuel in its own right we believe that the company as the world’s largest producer of ammonia with an unparalleled manufacturing and distribution network and deep technical expertise is uniquely positioned to fulfill anticipated demand for hydrogen and ammonia from green and lowcarbon sources our strategy is to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy our approach will focus on green ammonia production which refers to ammonia produced through a carbonfree process and lowcarbon ammonia which relates to ammonia produced by conventional processes but with co 2 removed through carbon capture and sequestration ccs and other certified carbon abatement projects we have announced an initial green ammonia project at our flagship donaldsonville nitrogen complex to produce approximately 20000 tons per year of green ammonia additionally we are developing ccs and other carbon abatement projects across our production facilities that will enable us to produce lowcarbon ammonia 

industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply and demand factors 

our products are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition the customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality the selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions changes in supply and demand and cost factors 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth gross domestic product growth changes in dietary habits planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand growth may depend on global economic conditions farm sector income weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption fertilizer application rates and governmental regulations including fertilizer subsidies or requirements mandating increased use of biofuels or industrial nitrogen products other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key exportingconsuming countries such as china india russia and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of nitrogenbased fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal therefore supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for these commodities 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental trade policies including the imposition of duties tariffs or quotas that affect foreign trade or investment the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last decade has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east the republic of trinidad and tobago north africa and russia have been major exporters to north america in recent years as a result the north american nitrogen fertilizer market is dependent on imports to balance supply and demand 

cf industries holdings inc 

farmers’ economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns crop prices fertilizer products used and timing of applications expected yields and the types of crops planted 

market conditions and current developments 

covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization characterized the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 as a pandemic since that time efforts to slow the spread of covid19 have intensified a number of countries as well as certain states and cities within the united states have continued to enact temporary closures of businesses to issue shelter in place or quarantine orders and to take other restrictive measures in response to the pandemic 

due to the use of fertilizer products in crop production to support the global food supply chain our business operations were designated as part of the critical infrastructure by the united states and as essential businesses in the united kingdom and canada with corresponding designations for those states and provinces in which we operate that issued restrictive orders as a result our manufacturing complexes continued to operate during 2020 and have continued to operate through the date of this report our production of ammonia the basic building block for our products was 104 million tons in 2020 compared to 102 million tons in 2019 through the date of this filing we have continued to ship products by all modes of transportation to our customers and we have not experienced any significant delays in marine rail or truck transportation services due to the pandemic 

in 2020 we did not experience a meaningful impact in customer demand as a result of the covid19 pandemic our total volume of products shipped in 2020 of 203 million tons was 4 higher compared to 195 million tons in 2019 

in response to the pandemic we instituted safety precautions early in 2020 to protect the health and wellbeing of all of our employees including the manufacturing workforce who operate our nitrogen complexes and distribution facilities these safety measures included installing thermal temperature checks at each of our sites for all personnel including contractors who arrive at our sites adjusting schedules to support social distancing including changes to loading and shipping procedures maintaining a close contact log for employees selfquarantine logs requiring face coverings on site restricting visitor access and implementing enhanced cleaning protocols and travel restrictions for employees we also paid approximately 19 million of bonuses to our operational workforce under a special covid19 bonus program which concluded in june 2020 in addition since midmarch 2020 the majority of our nonoperational personnel at our sites who work in administrative and operational support functions have worked remotely in order to maintain social distancing following governmental guidelines these administrative and operational support functions have operated effectively during this period meeting our commitments to our customers and continuing to manage our business without interruption we have not furloughed any employees or instituted any reductions in pay or benefits or other significant cost containment measures due to the pandemic 

we participate in a global market which includes a global supply chain and customer base the longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic are unclear and could adversely affect our business in the future we have operated our business in a remote working environment and could continue to do so for an extended duration if necessary however if the pandemic were to impact a large portion of our workforce in any one location we might need to idle that facility temporarily or transfer other employees from other network sites which could have an impact on our business operations profitability and cash flow the impact of the covid19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve as a result we cannot predict the extent to which our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be impacted by the pandemic in the future

there was strong demand for fertilizer in 2020 as we shipped 203 million tons of product compared to 195 million tons in 2019 which increased net sales by 199 million the increase in total sales volume was due primarily to the impact of increased supply resulting from both higher inventory levels entering 2020 and higher production in 2020 our sales volumes in 2020 were higher across all of our major products compared to 2019 

cf industries holdings inc 

our shipments can shift between quarters due primarily to shifts in weather patterns that impact fertilizer applications during the fourth quarter of 2020 granular urea sales volume was higher as domestic demand strengthened amid increasing crop prices and overall farm economics improved additionally ammonia sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2020 exceeded the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of increased demand due to an early fall harvest and ideal weather conditions throughout the midwestern united states 

sales volume for our products in 2020 2019 and 2018 is shown in the table below 



we expect sales volumes for our products to return to a range of 19195 million product tons in 2021 due to lower yearend inventory than the year before and lower expected production due to a higher number of planned turnarounds than in 2020 

selling prices 

the selling prices for all of our major products were lower in 2020 than 2019 as global energy prices remained low driving higher global nitrogen operating rates and the resulting additional global supply availability the average selling price for our products for 2020 and 2019 was 203 per ton and 235 per ton respectively the decrease in average selling prices of 14 in 2020 from 2019 decreased net sales by 665 million 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce our nitrogen products we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce nitrogen products natural gas is a significant cost component of manufactured nitrogen products representing approximately onethird of our production costs 

most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada as a result the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america have declined over the last decade but are subject to volatility natural gas prices during 2020 were lower on average than 2019 due in part to reduced energy demand as a result of the covid19 pandemic partially offset by reductions in supply the daily market price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america fluctuated throughout 2020 the average daily market price at the henry hub was 199 per mmbtu for 2020 compared to 251 per mmbtu for 2019 a decrease of 21 the price of natural gas decreased in the first half of 2020 and increased in the second half of 2020 with the average daily market price rising at the henry hub to 247 per mmbtu in the fourth quarter of 2020 

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp the price of natural gas in the united kingdom during 2020 was lower on average compared to 2019 as a result of increased availability of liquefied natural gas in the global market as well as the global economic downturn related to the covid19 pandemic the average daily market price at nbp was 320 per mmbtu for 2020 compared to 444 per mmbtu for 2019 a decrease of 28 the daily market price at nbp also fluctuated throughout 2020 as the price decreased in the first half of 2020 and increased in the second half of 2020 with the average daily market price rising at the nbp to 529 per mmbtu in the fourth quarter of 2020 

natural gas costs in cost of sales including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives was 224 per mmbtu in 2020 an 18 decrease from 274 per mmbtu in 2019 which resulted in an increase in gross margin of approximately 195 million

financial executive summary 

we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 317 million in 2020 compared to 493 million in 2019 a decline in net earnings of 36 or 176 million the decrease in net earnings was due primarily to lower selling prices as lower global energy costs drove higher global operating rates leading to increased global nitrogen supply availability the impact of lower selling prices was partially offset by lower realized natural gas costs and higher sales volume leading to a net decline in gross margin of 373 million in 2020 gross margin declined from 1174 million in 2019 to 801 million in 2020 the following describes the significant factors that impacted gross margin 

• average selling prices declined 14 in 2020 to 203 per ton which decreased gross margin by 665 million 

• realized natural gas costs declined by 18 in 2020 to 224 per mmbtu which increased gross margin by 195 million 

• sales volume increased 4 to 203 million product tons the highest annual sales volume for the company the increase in sales volume increased gross margin by 61 million 

additionally net earnings were impacted by lower selling general and administrative costs which declined by 33 million due primarily to the impact of lower corporate project activity and travel during the covid19 pandemic and a decline in our annual tax provision of 95 million driven by lower pretax earnings as well as certain favorable discrete tax items including the impact of the terra amended tax returns see discussion under “items affecting comparability — terra amended tax returns” below for further information 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased 076 per share to 147 per share in 2020 compared to 223 per share in 2019 this decrease is due primarily to lower net earnings partially offset by a 3 reduction in diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program on february 13 2019 our board of directors the board authorized the repurchase of up to 1 billion of cf holdings common stock through december 31 2021 the 2019 share repurchase program in 2019 we repurchased approximately 76 million shares under the 2019 share repurchase program for 337 million in 2020 we repurchased approximately 26 million shares under the 2019 share repurchase program for 100 million no shares were repurchased under the 2019 share repurchase program in the second third or fourth quarter of 2020 see discussion under “liquidity and capital resources—share repurchase programs” below for further information

unrealized net marktomarket gain loss on natural gas derivatives 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile single component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased products at certain times we have managed the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivatives that we may use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps basis swaps and options we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting this can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations in 2020 and 2019 we recognized an unrealized net marktomarket gain loss on natural gas derivatives of 6 million and 14 million respectively 

covid impacts 

in march 2020 a shortterm bonus program was initiated to compensate operational employees for continuing their critical tasks at the beginning of the covid19 pandemic the bonus program concluded in june 2020 approximately 19 million was paid as part of the program and was recognized in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 

in addition certain plant turnaround activities were deferred because of the covid19 pandemic as a result we incurred 7 million of expense for the year ended december 31 2020 which was recognized in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations

loss gain on foreign currency transactions including intercompany loans 

in 2020 and 2019 we recognized a loss gain of 5 million and 1 million respectively which consists of foreign currency exchange rate impacts on foreign currency denominated transactions including the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany loans that were not permanently invested 

engineering cost writeoff 

in june 2020 a project at one of our nitrogen complexes was cancelled and as a result 9 million of previously capitalized engineering costs were expensed in the year ended december 31 2020 the expense is reflected in other operating—net in our consolidated statement of operations 

loss on sale of surplus land 

in 2020 we recognized a loss of 2 million on the sale of surplus land which is reflected in other operating—net in our consolidated statement of operations 

insurance proceeds 

we recognized income of 37 million in both 2020 and 2019 related to insurance claims at one of our nitrogen complexes the 37 million of income in 2020 consists of 35 million related to business interruption insurance proceeds and 2 million related to property insurance proceeds the 37 million of income in 2019 consisted of 22 million related to business interruption insurance proceeds and 15 million related to property insurance proceeds these proceeds are reflected in other operating—net in our consolidated statements of operations

terra amended tax returns 

we completed the acquisition of terra industries inc terra in april 2010 after the acquisition we determined that the manner in which terra reported the repatriation of cash from foreign affiliates to its us parent for us and foreign income tax purposes was not appropriate as a result in 2012 we amended certain tax returns including terra’s income and withholding tax returns back to 1999 the amended tax returns and paid additional income and withholding taxes and related interest and penalties in early 2013 the internal revenue service irs commenced an examination of the us tax aspects of the amended tax returns in 2017 we also made a voluntary disclosure filing with the canadian revenue agency cra with respect to the canadian tax aspects of this matter and paid additional canadian taxes due 

in early 2019 the irs completed its examination of the amended tax returns and submitted its audit reports and related refund claims to the joint committee on taxation of the us congress the joint committee for purposes of its review the joint committee separated the irs audit reports into two separate matters i an income tax related matter and ii a withholding tax matter in late 2019 we received notification that the joint committee had approved the irs audit reports and related income tax refunds relating to the income tax related matter as a result of the approval by the joint committee we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019 interest income of 5 million 4 million after tax and a reduction in income tax 

cf industries holdings inc 

expense of 10 million related to the favorable settlement of certain uncertain tax positions no income tax refunds were received in 2019 related to the amended tax returns 

i n 2020 we received notification that the joint committee approved the irs audit report and related withholding tax refunds relating to the withholding tax matter and we received irs notices indicating the amount of tax and interest to be refunded and received with respect to the withholding tax matter and the income tax matter in addition the cra settled with us the voluntary disclosure matter 

in 2020 as a result of these events we recognized 26 million of interestrelated income and 18 million of income tax benefit which consisted of the following 

• additional income of 26 million 23 million net of tax representing 16 million of interest income related to the us federal income tax matter and withholding tax matter and a 10 million reversal of previously accrued interest related to the canadian tax aspects of this matter 

• a reduction in our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of 12 million with a corresponding reduction in income tax expense related to the us federal withholding tax matter and 

• additional income tax benefit of 9 million related to the us federal income tax matter and related state amended returns 

in 2020 we received us federal income tax refunds including interest of 110 million relating to the amended tax returns consisting of 68 million related to the income tax matter and 42 million related to the withholding tax matter which finalized these matters with the irs as a result of the finalization of the income tax matter and the withholding tax matter all us federal tax years commencing before january 1 2012 are now closed 

in the first quarter of 2021 we received approximately 20 million of withholding tax refunds including interest from the cra related to the voluntary disclosure filing these amounts were previously recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 

plnl withholding tax charge 

the trinidadian tax authority the board of inland revenue issued a proposed tax assessment against plnl our joint venture in the republic of trinidad and tobago with respect to tax years 2011 and 2012 in the amount of approximately 12 million the proposed assessment asserted that plnl should have withheld tax at a higher rate on dividends paid to its trinidadian owners the board of inland revenue also would have assessed statutory interest and penalties on the amount of tax owed when a final assessment was issued for the tax years 2011 and 2012 

during the third quarter of 2019 the trinidadian government offered a tax amnesty period that provided taxpayers the opportunity to pay any prior year tax obligations and avoid accumulated interest or penalties during the tax amnesty period plnl evaluated the proposed assessment including considering the outcome of certain recent legal cases involving other taxpayers as a result of this evaluation in the third quarter of 2019 plnl paid withholding tax to the board of inland revenue under the amnesty program for tax years back to 2011 and recognized a charge for 32 million our 50 share of plnl’s tax charge is 16 million which reduced our equity in earnings of operating affiliate for 2019

net sales 

our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen products and are determined by the quantities of nitrogen products we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

our total net sales decreased 466 million or 10 to 412 billion in 2020 compared to 459 billion in 2019 due to a 14 decrease in average selling prices which decreased net sales by 665 million partially offset by a 4 increase in sales volume which increased net sales by 199 million 

average selling prices were 203 per ton in 2020 compared to 235 per ton in 2019 a decrease of 14 due primarily to lower average selling prices across all products primarily driven by increased global nitrogen supply availability as lower global energy costs drove higher global operating rates the increase in total sales volume of 4 was due to higher sales volume across all our products as greater supply availability resulting from both higher inventory levels entering 2020 and higher production in 2020 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs consist of the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities which are recognized in cost of sales when the product is sold to our customers and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

our cost of sales decreased 93 million or 3 to 332 billion in 2020 as compared to 342 billion in 2019 the decrease in our cost of sales was due primarily to the impact of lower realized natural gas costs including the impact of realized derivatives and lower costs related to plant maintenance activity we recognized an unrealized net marktomarket gain on natural gas derivatives of 6 million in 2020 compared to an unrealized net marktomarket loss of 14 million in 2019 these factors were partially offset by an increase in cost of sales due to higher sales volumes higher distribution costs and costs related to the special covid19 bonus the special covid19 bonus is more fully described in the section above titled “items affecting comparability of results—covid impacts” the cost of sales per ton averaged 164 in 2020 a 6 decrease from 175 per ton in 2019 realized natural gas costs including the impact of realized derivatives decreased 18 to 224 per mmbtu in 2020 from 274 per mmbtu in 2019 

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial it and sales functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees including those for corporate initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 33 million or 14 to 206 million in 2020 from 239 million in 2019 the decrease was due primarily to lower corporate project activity and travel as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

other operating—net 

other operating—net includes administrative costs that do not relate directly to our central operations costs included in “other operating costs” can include foreign exchange gains and losses unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives costs associated with our closed facilities amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets 

other operating—net was 17 million of income in 2020 compared to 73 million of income in 2019 the income in 2020 includes insurance proceeds of 37 million the insurance proceeds were partially offset by 9 million of expense related to the cancellation of a project and foreign currency transaction losses of 5 million which includes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany loans that were not permanently invested the income in 2019 was due 

cf industries holdings inc 

primarily to the gain recognized on the sale of the pine bend facility of 45 million and insurance proceeds of 37 million partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses each of these items is more fully described in the section above titled “items affecting comparability of results” 

equity in earnings loss of operating affiliate 

equity in earnings loss of operating affiliate consists of our 50 ownership interest in plnl we include our share of the net earnings from our equity method investment in plnl as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition 

equity in earnings of operating affiliate was 11 million in 2020 compared to a loss of 5 million in 2019 the loss in 2019 included approximately 16 million related to a withholding tax charge recognized by plnl regarding a multiyear tax dispute see “items affecting comparability of results—plnl withholding tax charge” above for additional information 

interest expense—net 

our interest expense—net includes the interest expense on our longterm debt amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements annual fees pursuant to our revolving credit agreement and interest on tax liabilities capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related assets interest expense—net also includes interest income which includes amounts earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments and any interest earned related to income tax refunds 

net interest expense decreased by 56 million to 161 million in 2020 from 217 million in 2019 the decrease was due primarily to our redemption of 750 million aggregate principal amount of longterm debt in the fourth quarter of 2019 which is more fully described under “liquidity and capital resources—senior notes” below in addition the decrease reflects 26 million of income in 2020 related to the finalization of the terra amended tax returns which is more fully described under “liquidity and capital resources—terra amended tax returns” below

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased 38 million or 25 to 115 million in 2020 compared to 153 million in 2019 due to lower earnings of cfn driven by lower average selling prices due primarily to increased global nitrogen supply availability 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders 

net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased 076 to 147 per diluted share in 2020 from 223 per diluted share in 2019 this decrease is due primarily to lower net earnings partially offset by the impact of a 3 reduction in diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program see discussion under “liquidity and capital resources—share repurchase program” below for further information

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs working capital capital expenditures debt service investments taxes share repurchases and dividends our working capital requirements are affected by several factors including demand for our products selling prices raw material costs freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business in addition we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

generally our primary source of cash is cash from operations which includes cash generated by customer advances we may also from time to time access the capital markets or engage in borrowings under our revolving credit agreement our cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 as the impact of the covid19 pandemic unfolded in many locations around the world credit markets began to function less efficiently causing concern about liquidity in credit markets generally in response to this and out of an abundance of caution we borrowed 500 million under our 750 million revolving credit agreement to ensure we maintained ample financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in the global markets including the financial credit markets in april 2020 due to confidence in the functioning of the credit markets and strong nitrogen fertilizer business conditions we repaid the 500 million of borrowings 

our cash and cash equivalents balance was 683 million at december 31 2020 an increase of 396 million from 287 million at december 31 2019 at december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under our revolving credit agreement senior notes and senior secured notes and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement was 750 million 

on february 17 2021 we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary cf industries elected to redeem in full the entire outstanding 250 million principal amount of 3400 senior secured notes due december 2021 the 2021 notes on march 20 2021 in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2021 notes based on market interest rates on february 12 2021 we estimate that the total amount for the redemption of the 2021 notes will be approximately 258 million including accrued interest 

cash equivalents 

cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less under our shortterm investment policy we may invest our cash balances either directly or through mutual funds in several types of investmentgrade securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations securities issued by governmental entities include those issued directly by the us and canadian federal governments those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities 

share repurchase program 

on february 13 2019 the board authorized the repurchase of up to 1 billion of cf holdings common stock through december 31 2021 the 2019 share repurchase program repurchases under the 2019 share repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market through privately negotiated transactions block transactions or otherwise the manner timing and amount of repurchases will be determined by our management based on the evaluation of market conditions stock price and other factors 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we repurchased approximately 76 million shares of cf holdings common stock under the 2019 share repurchase program for 337 million in june and december of 2019 we retired approximately 42 million and 34 million shares respectively that were repurchased under the 2019 share repurchase program in 2019 

during the first quarter of 2020 we repurchased approximately 26 million shares of cf holdings common stock under the 2019 share repurchase program for 100 million and retired those shares in the second quarter of 2020 no shares were repurchased in the second third or fourth quarter of 2020 under the 2019 share repurchase program at december 31 2020 we held 102843 shares of treasury stock

the following table summarizes the share repurchases under the 2019 share repurchase program 



capital spending 

we make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base increase our capacity improve plant efficiency and comply with various environmental health and safety requirements capital expenditures totaled 309 million in 2020 compared to 404 million in 2019 the decrease in capital expenditures in 2020 was due primarily to actions take to defer certain nonessential capital project activity as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

capital expenditures in 2021 are estimated to be in the range of 450 million which reflects a return to a normal spending level and includes expenditures for our initial green ammonia project at our donaldsonville complex planned capital expenditures are generally subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting unanticipated increases in cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties delays in the receipt of equipment adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties all of these factors may also be influenced or exacerbated by the direct or indirect impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

government policies 

the policies or laws of governments around the world can result in the imposition of taxes duties tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world the policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers or farmers due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic political and social objectives additionally the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity the impact of changes in governmental policies or laws or the political or social objectives of a country could have a material impact on fertilizer demand and selling prices and therefore could impact our liquidity 

ethanol industry and the renewable fuel standard 

corn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 35 of total us corn demand us government policy as expressed in the renewable fuel standard rfs is a major determinant for the ethanol market the rfs establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels including ethanol that must be included in the united states’ supply of fuel for transportation in addition the us congress at various times has proposed legislation to either modify or eliminate the rfs while past legislation proposing changes to the rfs has not been enacted into law there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be enacted into law other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol gasoline and corn lower gasoline prices and fewer aggregate miles driven by increased automobile fuel efficiency or the continued expansion of electric vehicles may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry this could impact the demand for corn and nitrogen fertilizer and therefore could impact our liquidity

terra amended tax returns 

in 2020 we received income tax refunds including interest of 110 million relating to the settlement of irs audits of amended tax returns that we had filed in 2012 related to prior tax years see discussion under “items affecting comparability—terra amended tax returns” above for further information 

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

we have operations in canada the united kingdom and a 50 interest in a joint venture in the republic of trinidad and tobago historically the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us were recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings were recognized unless the earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested based upon our then current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurred at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings could occur in different periods 

in light of changes made by the tax act commencing with the 2018 tax year the united states no longer taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries even when such earnings are earned or repatriated to the united states unless such earnings are subject to us rules on passive income or certain antiabuse provisions foreign subsidiary earnings may still be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated to the united states 

cash balances held by our joint venture are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint venture on a periodic basis 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 122 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 683 million was held by our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries historically and for the current year the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represented accumulated earnings of our foreign operations that were not considered to be permanently reinvested as of december 31 2020 we would not expect any additional cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian and united kingdom cash balances if we were to repatriate this cash in the future other than foreign withholding tax 

net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2018 we had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards collectively the tax loss carryforwards of 271 million these tax loss carryforwards were available to reduce taxable income and thereby reduce cash taxes in the united states and other tax jurisdictions in which they could be applied as a result of the effective usage of certain of these tax loss carryforwards to offset current cash taxes payable there were no us federal tax loss carryforwards remaining as of december 31 2019 as a result we paid income taxes of approximately 111 million in 2020 net of income tax refunds of approximately 90 million primarily related to the terra amended tax returns which are more fully described above under “items affecting comparability—terra amended tax returns”

forward sales and customer advances 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose therefore our reported nitrogen fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contract’s value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time control transfers to the customer thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until control transfers and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had 130 million and 119 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets 

while customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers’ outlook of future market fundamentals during periods of declining prices customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the current prices if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase additionally borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity 

under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customer’s inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales 

natural gas 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen products we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other products expenditures on natural gas are a significant portion of our production costs representing approximately onethird of our total production costs in 2020 as a result of these factors natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity 

we enter into agreements for a portion of our future natural gas supply and related transportation as of december 31 2020 our natural gas purchase agreements have terms that range from one to five years and a total minimum commitment of approximately 430 million and our natural gas transportation agreements have terms that range from one to ten years and a total minimum commitment of approximately 180 million our minimum commitments to purchase and transport natural gas are based on prevailing marketbased forward prices excluding reductions for plant maintenance and turnaround activities

because most of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america have declined in the last decade but are subject to volatility during 2020 the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 134 per mmbtu on september 22 2020 and three consecutive days in october and a high of 308 per mmbtu on october 27 2020 during the threeyear period ended december 31 2020 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 134 per mmbtu on september 22 2020 and three consecutive days in october 2020 and a high of 688 per mmbtu on january 4 2018 

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2020 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 104 per mmbtu on may 22 2020 and a high of 771 per mmbtu on december 30 2020 during the threeyear period ended december 31 2020 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 104 per mmbtu on may 22 2020 and a high of 3174 per mmbtu on march 2 2018 

natural gas costs in our cost of sales including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives decreased 18 to 224 per mmbtu in 2020 from 274 per mmbtu in 2019 

derivative financial instruments 

we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for our nitrogen products from time to time we may also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives in 2020 and 2019 we recognized an unrealized net marktomarket gain loss on natural gas derivatives of 6 million and 14 million respectively which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 

derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks other major financial institutions or large energy companies and the use of international swaps and derivatives association isda master netting arrangements the isda agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for overthecounter derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk in part by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement 

the isda agreements for most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support thresholds in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position the revolving credit agreement at any time when it is secured provides a cross collateral feature for those of our derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to or affiliates of parties to the revolving credit agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives in the event the revolving credit agreement becomes unsecured separate collateral could be required in connection with such derivatives 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 6 million and 12 million respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates as of december 31 2020 our open natural gas derivative contracts consisted of natural gas fixed price swaps and basis swaps for 341 million mmbtus as of december 31 2019 contracts consisted of natural gas fixed price swaps basis swaps and options for 411 million mmbtus at both december 31 2020 and 2019 we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts the credit support documents executed in connection with certain of our isda agreements generally provide us and our counterparties the right to set off collateral against amounts owing under the isda agreements upon the occurrence of a default or a specified termination event

cash flows 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was 1231 million as compared to 1505 million in 2019 a decrease of 274 million the decrease in cash flow from operations was due primarily to lower net earnings and higher cash taxes paid partially offset by favorable changes in net working capital cash paid for taxes net of refunds was 111 million in 2020 compared to a net refund of 41 million in 2019 in 2020 we received income tax refunds including interest of 110 million related to the finalization of amended us tax returns which is further described above under terra amended tax returns during 2020 net changes in working capital contributed 12 million to cash flow from operations while in 2019 net changes in working capital reduced cash flow from operations by 112 million the increased cash flow from working capital changes was primarily driven by inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 299 million in 2020 compared to 319 million in 2019 during 2020 capital expenditures totaled 309 million compared to 404 million in 2019 the decrease in capital expenditures in 2020 was due primarily to actions taken to defer certain nonessential capital project activity as a result of the covid19 pandemic net cash used in investing activities in 2019 included proceeds of 55 million related to the sale of our pine bend facility and 15 million related to property insurance proceeds received 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 542 million in 2020 compared to 1583 million in 2019 the decline in cash used in financing activities was due to cash used to redeem certain senior notes in 2019 and higher share repurchase activity in 2019 in 2019 we paid 769 million in connection with the redemption of the 2020 notes and the partial redemption of the 2021 notes in 2020 we spent 100 million to repurchase shares of common stock compared to 370 million in 2019 which included approximately 33 million related to shares repurchased in late 2018 that were paid for in 2019 dividends paid on common stock in 2020 and 2019 were 258 million and 265 million respectively distributions to noncontrolling interest totaled 174 million in 2020 as compared to 186 million in 2019

critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap us gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting estimates 

income taxes 

we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period in which these changes occur 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets 

as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation in the countries in which we operate changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and foreign joint venture that could be subjected to us taxation it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods 

we operate in a number of countries and as a result have a significant amount of cross border transactions the taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators in countries across the globe including the countries in which we operate the tax rules and regulations within the various countries in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various countries as a result there are instances where regulators within the countries involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances we work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions however there are instances where reaching a common understanding is not possible or practical 

we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold but are not highly certain are measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authority as of december 31 2020 we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits including penalties and interest of 85 million this amount represents our best estimate of the potential amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions differences in interpretation of the tax laws can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimates 

recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include production and sales volumes selling prices raw material costs operating rates operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of 

cf industries holdings inc 

the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review 

the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value and the reduction in value is other than temporary the reduction in value would be recognized immediately in earnings 

plnl is our joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied under a gas sales contract the ngc contract by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method the joint venture experienced past curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which reduced the ammonia production at plnl the ngc contract had an initial expiration date of september 2018 and was extended on the same terms until september 2023 any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will be based on new agreements if ngc does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to plnl at prices that permit profitable operations plnl may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in plnl the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2020 is 80 million 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further analysis is necessary however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test which involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill impairment would be recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit we identified no goodwill impairment in 2020 2019 or 2018 as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the carrying value of our goodwill was 237 billion 

intangible assets identified in connection with our 2010 acquisition of terra consist of customer relationships which are being amortized over a period of 18 years the intangible assets identified in connection with our 2015 acquisition of cf fertilisers uk consist of customer relationships and trade names which are being amortized over a period of approximately 20 years our intangible assets are presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets see note 7—goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized key assumptions that affect our projected benefit obligation pbo are discount rates and in addition for our united kingdom plans an adjusted retail price index rpi key assumptions affecting pension expense include discount rates the expected longterm rate of return on assets eroa and in addition for our united kingdom plans rpi 

the december 31 2020 pbo was computed based on a weightedaverage discount rate of 24 for our north america plans and 15 for our united kingdom plans which were based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 2020 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo the weightedaverage discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2020 was 31 for north america plans and 20 for united kingdom plans our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 41 weightedaverage eroa used to calculate pension expense in 2020 for our north america plans is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods the 34 weightedaverage eroa used to calculate pension expense in 2020 for our united kingdom plans is based on expected longterm performance of underlying investments the eroa for both north america and united kingdom plans are adjusted for expenses and diversification bonuses if applicable for our united kingdom plans the 30 rpi used to calculate our pbo and the 30 rpi used to calculate 2020 pension

expense are developed using the bank of england implied retail price inflation curve which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and indexlinked government bonds 

for north america qualified pension plans our pbo was 884 million as of december 31 2020 which was 38 million higher than pension plan assets for our united kingdom pension plans our pbo was 643 million as of december 31 2020 which was 152 million higher than pension plan assets the tables below estimate the impact of a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the key assumptions on our december 31 2020 pbo and 2020 pension expense

subsequent event 

in february 2021 the central portion of the united states experienced extreme and unprecedented cold weather certain natural gas suppliers declared force majeure events due to natural gas well freeze offs or frozen equipment this occurred at the same time as large increases in natural gas demand were occurring due to the cold temperatures due to these unprecedented factors several states declared a state of emergency and natural gas was redirected for residential usage at certain of our manufacturing locations we were asked to reduce our natural gas consumption and therefore these plants either operated at reduced rates or temporarily suspended operations we returned excess natural gas to our suppliers and received prevailing market prices which were in excess of our cost during this period of time we have experienced lower production but have procured product in order to meet customer obligations higher maintenance and repair activity may be necessary as the plants are restarted at the present time we do not know the net positive or negative impact of these events on our operations however we do not expect it to result in a material impact to our business

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to nitrogenbased products are sensitive to changes in selling prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea uan 32 and an by approximately 33 22 14 and 15 respectively 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased products at certain times we have managed the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivative instruments that we may use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps basis swaps and options these derivatives settle using primarily a nymex futures price index which represents the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods as of december 31 2020 we had natural gas fixed price swaps and basis swaps covering certain periods through march 2022 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had open derivative contracts for 341 million mmbtus and 411 million mmbtus respectively a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas at december 31 2020 would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of 18 million and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by 18 million 

from time to time we may purchase nitrogen products on the open market to augment or replace production at our facilities 

interest rates 

as of december 31 2020 we had six series of senior notes totaling 400 billion of principal outstanding with maturity dates of december 1 2021 june 1 2023 december 1 2026 march 15 2034 june 1 2043 and march 15 2044 the senior notes have fixed interest rates as of december 31 2020 the carrying value and fair value of our senior notes was approximately 396 billion and 473 billion respectively 

borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear current market rates of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2020 or 2019 maximum borrowings under the revolving credit agreement during 2020 were 500 million the weightedaverage annual interest rate of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement during 2020 was 205 there were no borrowings under the prior credit agreement or the revolving credit agreement during 2019 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we are directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro we generally do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as central farmers fertilizer company and were owned by a group of regional agriculture cooperatives for the first 59 years of our existence central farmers became cf industries in 1970 

originally established as a fertilizer brokerage company we expanded owning and operating fertilizer manufacturing and distribution facilities in the early 1950s with a principal objective of assured supply for our owners at various times in our history we manufactured andor distributed nitrogen phosphate and potash fertilizers 

we operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners’ equity interests in cf industries were canceled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock at the time of the ipo our assets consisted of one wholly owned nitrogen manufacturing facility in louisiana united states a joint venture nitrogen manufacturing facility in alberta canada of which we owned 66 percent a phosphate mining and manufacturing operation in florida united states and distribution facilities throughout north america 

in april 2010 we acquired terra industries inc terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities an approximately 753 interest in tnclp and certain joint venture interests 

cf industries holdings inc 

in march 2014 we exited our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was located in florida through a sale to the mosaic company for approximately 14 billion in cash as a result our company became focused solely on nitrogen manufacturing and distribution 

in july 2015 we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us for total consideration of 570 million and cf fertilisers uk became wholly owned by us 

in february 2016 our strategic venture with chs commenced at which time chs made a capital contribution of 28 billion to cfn in exchange for membership interests in cfn which represented approximately 11 of the total membership interests of cfn 

in 2016 we completed capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa which increased our production capacity by approximately 25 for a total capital cost of 52 billion 

in 2018 we announced that tngp elected to exercise its right to purchase the tnclp public units tngp completed the purchase on april 2 2018 for an aggregate cash purchase price of 388 million upon completion of the purchase cf holdings owned through its subsidiaries 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of tnclp 

product tons and nutrient tons 

unless otherwise stated we measure our production and sales volume in this annual report on form 10k in product tons which represents the weight of the product measured in short tons one short ton is equal to 2000 pounds references to uan product tons assume a 32 nitrogen content basis for production volume 

we also provide certain supplementary volume information measured in nutrient tons nutrient tons represent the weight of the product’s nitrogen content which varies by product ammonia represents 82 nitrogen content granular urea represents 46 nitrogen content uan represents between 28 and 32 nitrogen content and an represents between 29 and 35 nitrogen content 

reportable segments 

our reportable segments consist of the following segments ammonia granular urea uan an and other these segments are differentiated by products we use gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources total other operating costs and expenses consisting of selling general and administrative expenses and other operating—net and nonoperating expenses interest and income taxes are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management see note 21—segment disclosures for additional information 

our products 

our primary nitrogen products are ammonia granular urea uan and an our historical sales of nitrogen products are shown in the following table net sales do not reflect amounts used internally such as ammonia in the manufacture of other products 

 

 gross margin was 1174 million  917 million and 434 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

cf industries holdings inc 

we own and operate seven nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in north america including five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in the united states and two in canada as of december 31 2019  the combined production capacity of these seven facilities represented approximately 39 42 44 and 19 of north american ammonia granular urea uan and an production capacity respectively each of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in north america has onsite storage to provide flexibility to manage the flow of outbound shipments without impacting production we also operate two united kingdom nitrogen manufacturing facilities that produce ammonia an and npks and serve primarily the british agricultural and industrial markets 

the following table shows the production capacities as of december 31 2019 at each of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities

cf industries holdings inc 

billingham united kingdom 

the billingham facility located in the teesside chemical area in northeastern england is geographically split among three primary locations the main site which contains an ammonia plant three nitric acid plants and a carbon dioxide plant the portrack site approximately two miles away which contains an an fertilizer plant and the north tees site approximately seven miles away which contains an ammonia storage area these locations collectively have onsite storage for 40000 tons of ammonia and 128000 tons of an 

point lisas trinidad 

the point lisas nitrogen facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago is owned jointly through a 5050 venture with koch fertilizer llc this facility has the capacity to produce 720000 tons of ammonia annually from natural gas supplied under a contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc 

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in 2019  natural gas accounted for approximately 35 of our total production costs for nitrogen fertilizer products our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities have access to abundant competitivelypriced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities our facilities utilize the following natural gas hubs henry hub in louisiana sonat in louisiana tetco ela in louisiana oneok in oklahoma aeco in alberta ventura in iowa demarcation in kansas welcome in minnesota dawn in ontario parkway in ontario and the national balancing point nbp in the united kingdom 

in 2019  our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consumed in the aggregate approximately 360 million mmbtus of natural gas we employ a combination of daily spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced supply of natural gas we also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices see note 15—derivative financial instruments for additional information about our natural gas hedging activities 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the safe efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen products is critical for successful operations our nitrogen production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship products to terminals warehouses and customers each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location 

our north american nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and to our storage facilities in the us and canada with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5000 tank and hopper cars as well as railcars provided by rail carriers our united kingdom nitrogen production facilities mainly ship products via truck 

the north american waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our donaldsonville verdigris and yazoo city facilities to ship ammonia and uan we employ a fleet of eleven tow boats and thirtytwo river barges which are primarily leased we also utilize contract marine services to move urea fertilizer we can also export nitrogen fertilizer products via seagoing vessels from our donaldsonville yazoo city billingham and ince manufacturing facilities 

the donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2000mile long nustar pipeline through which we have the ability to transport ammonia to ten terminals and shipping points in the midwestern us corn belt our verdigris and port neal facilities are connected to the 1100mile long magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the midwestern united states on january 31 2019 magellan midstream partners lp magellan announced its decision to discontinue commercial operations of the ammonia pipeline beginning in late 2019 in september 2019 the portion of the magellan ammonia pipeline that connects to our verdigris oklahoma complex was permanently shut down resulting in the loss of future distribution of verdigris ammonia production through this pipeline in addition we expect that the portion of the magellan ammonia pipeline that connects to our port neal iowa complex will permanently shut down in march 2020 which will result in the loss of future distribution of port neal ammonia production through this pipeline 

cf industries holdings inc 

storage facilities and other properties 

as of december 31 2019  we owned or leased space at 70 inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 24state region of the united states canada and the united kingdom including storage at our production facilities we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately 32 million tons of product our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table 



 

 customers 

the principal customers for our nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products are cooperatives independent fertilizer distributors traders wholesalers and industrial users sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force chs was our largest customer in 2019 and accounted for approximately 15 of our consolidated net sales we have a strategic venture with chs and they have a minority equity interest in cfn see note 17—noncontrolling interests for additional information on our strategic venture with chs 

competition 

our markets are global and intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

our primary north americanbased competitors include nutrien ltd koch fertilizer llc and iowa fertilizer company there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition from foreignsourced products continuously 

our primary united kingdom competition comes from imported products supplied by companies including yara international origin fertilisers ameropa chs and helm urea and uan are not produced in the united kingdom but along with an are widelytraded fertilizer products with limited barriers to entry 

seasonality 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to weather conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other fertilizer producers generally manufacture and distribute products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom the european union and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act tsca and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment we may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future 

environmental health and safety expenditures 

our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2019 totaled approximately 40 million we estimate that we will have approximately 60 million of capital expenditures for environmental health and safety in 2020  environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cerclaremediation matters 

from time to time we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws in 2011 we received a notice from the idaho department of environmental quality ideq that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine site we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho the current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site based on a consent order entered into with ideq and the us forest service in 2014 we and the current property owner are currently conducting a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the site in 2015 we and several other parties received a notice that the us department of the interior and other trustees intend to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for 17 former phosphate mines in southeast idaho one of which is the former georgetown canyon mine see note 20—contingencies for additional information on the cerclaremediation matters 

regulation of greenhouse gases 

we are subject to regulations in the united kingdom the european union canada and the united states concerning greenhouse gas ghg emissions 

the united kingdom has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas emission trading system eu ets our uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require these plants to purchase co 2 emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our uk sites are also subject to the eu ets and are required to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset ghg emissions the eu has announced changes to the eu ets to increase the pace of emissions cuts beginning in 2021 notwithstanding the exit of the united kingdom from the european union brexit on january 31 2020 facilities in the united kingdom will remain subject to the eu ets at least through the end of 2020 although there is uncertainty about the ghg regulations that will apply thereafter a framework similar to the eu ets is a likely outcome 

in canada we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canada’s national pollutant release inventory and ontario’s mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation in 2018 the federal greenhouse pollution pricing act came into effect pursuant to which environment and climate change canada eccc will implement the outputbased performance standard obps which is intended to function as a backstop to provincial greenhouse gas emissions regulations in june 2019 the eccc finalized the emission 

cf industries holdings inc 

limits for carbon dioxide equivalent co 2 e emissions from nitrogen fertilizer products these emission limits are based on 95 of the average emissions intensity for the production of such products from all canadian nitrogen fertilizer plants reflecting that such products are deemed to be energyintensive and tradeexposed and thus subject to a less stringent emissions reduction requirement in the provinces and territories where the obps will apply a facility whose carbon emissions exceed the applicable limits will be required to offset emissions by obtaining and retiring surplus emission credits obtaining qualifying emissions offsets or paying a fee of 20 per ton of excess carbon dioxide equivalent for calendar year 2019 which fee will rise by 10 per ton for each year through 2022 ontario and saskatchewan are challenging whether the federal government has jurisdiction to impose a federal carbon price on the provinces and territories the saskatchewan court of appeal in may 2019 and the ontario court of appeal in june 2019 each held that the greenhouse pollution pricing act was validly enacted under the canadian constitution ontario and saskatchewan both appealed these decisions to the supreme court of canada and oral arguments are scheduled for march 2020 in june 2019 alberta filed a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the statute notwithstanding that the question will be resolved by the pending supreme court appeals 

in january 2017 ontario launched its own ghg cap and trade program and beginning january 1 2018 ontario’s cap and trade program was linked with the cap and trade programs in quebec and california our courtright nitrogen complex was subject to the ontario cap and trade program however the ontario government rescinded the cap and trade program in june 2018 because ontario no longer has a ghg regulatory regime the federal government imposed the obps in the province beginning in 2019 in july 2019 the new ontario government enacted a new ghg regulation called the emissions performance standards program eps that sets co 2 e emissions limits for nitrogen products based on a production weighted sectoral average for facilities whose carbon emissions exceed the applicable limits compliance options include the purchase emissions performance units for a fee of 20 per ton of excess co 2 e for calendar year 2020 which fee will rise by 10 per ton each year through 2023 except for registration and recordkeeping provisions the eps will not go into effect until the federal government determines that the regulation satisfies the federal stringency requirements at which time the eps would replace the opbs in ontario 

in alberta the specified gas emitters regulation was implemented in 2007 this program required facilities emitting more than 100000 tons of ghgs per year to reduce emissions by 12 over such facilities’ 2007 levels to meet this requirement companies could reduce emissions purchaseuse offset credits or contribute to a technology fund at an annual rate of 15 per ton of co 2  beginning in 2018 our medicine hat nitrogen complex became subject to the carbon competitiveness incentive regulation ccir this regulation establishes productspecific benchmarks based on the most efficient ghg emitting facilities in a sector a facility with emissions that exceeded the applicable benchmark was required to take action to reduce its ghg emissions intensity purchase emissions offsets or performance credits or make contributions to alberta’s climate fund in 2019 the alberta government passed the technology innovation and emission reduction implementation act tier which will replace the ccir and go into effect on january 1 2020 the tier requires large emitting facilities other than electricity producers which are subject to a different standard to comply with the least stringent of a “facilityspecific” benchmark of 90 of historical ghg emissions intensity from a threeyear baseline which intensity limit will be reduced by 1 a year beginning in 2021 or a benchmark reflecting the emissions intensity of the top 10 of facilities for a given sector the compliance options under the tier are similar to the compliance options under the ccir the federal government had determined that alberta’s ccir meets its stringency requirements and did not impose the obps in 2019 in december 2019 the federal government determined that the tier also met the stringency requirements of the obps with respect to its regulation of large industrial emitters however the tier set the price for payments into its carbon fund at 30 per ton the same effective price as set in the ccir this could result in regulated facilities in alberta being subject to the obps beginning in 2021 when the effective price of carbon pursuant to the obps rises to 40 per ton of excess co 2 e 

in the united states ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels although some of the more significant developments to date including epa’s clean power plan which was rescinded in june 2019 and replaced by the affordable clean energy rule do not directly impose obligations on our facilities the epa has issued a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and reporting the previous year’s emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result are required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd construction permit applicable to such facilities we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to ghgs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects other than the states’ implementation of this permitting requirement none of the states where our us production facilities are locatediowa louisiana mississippi and oklahomahas proposed control regulations limiting ghg emissions 

there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations including in the united states on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement which was accepted by the united states and ratified by canada and the united kingdom 

cf industries holdings inc 

went into effect in november 2016 the paris agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15°c above preindustrial levels in june 2017 the united states announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement subject to renegotiation of the paris agreement on terms more favorable to the united states on november 4 2019 the united states submitted formal notice of its withdrawal from the paris agreement which will become effective on november 4 2020 to date the united states is the only signatory to withdraw from the paris agreement if the paris agreement remains in effect it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

new source performance standards for nitric acid plants 

we operate 14 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides nox notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas 

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals more stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we employed approximately 3000 employees

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties individually or in combination could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand for nitrogen is affected by planted acreage crop selection and fertilizer application rates driven by population growth or changes in dietary habits and nonfood use of crops such as production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things demand also includes industrial uses of nitrogen for example chemical manufacturing and emissions reductants such as diesel exhaust fluid def supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade 

periods of strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to stimulate global investment in production capacity in the last several years fertilizer producers including cf holdings have built new production facilities or expanded capacity of existing production assets or announced plans to do so the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply availability and affect the balance of supply and demand in recent years global nitrogen fertilizer capacity has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating a surplus of global nitrogen fertilizer capacity which led to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in 2016 and 2017 for example in the twoyear period ended december 31 2017 additional production capacity came on line and at the same time the average selling price for our products declined 34 from 314 per ton in 2015 to 207 per ton in 2017 

additional production capacity is expected to come on line over the next 12 months outside of north america we cannot predict the impact of this additional capacity also global or local economic and financial conditions or changes in such conditions or other factors may cause acceleration of other announced andor ongoing projects 

price fluctuations for our products result from changes in supply and demand significant price fluctuations we experience could be symptoms of an oversupplied market in transition as new capacity ramps up and production slows down or shuts down in high cost regions additionally trade flows adjust as imports into different regions of the world also impact the local supply and demand balances if imports increase into an oversupplied region lower prices in that region could result 

during periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production in 2016 and 2017 our financial performance credit ratings and the trading price for our common stock were negatively impacted by the lower selling prices resulting from the global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer while the average selling price for our products has increased 3 in 2019 to 235 per ton compared to 229 per ton in 2018  the period of time that these oversupply conditions can persist and the degree to which they will impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows is uncertain 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent customer service and product quality as a consequence conditions in the international market for nitrogen products significantly influence our operating results 

we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of our competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities furthermore certain governments in some cases as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products or subsidize production or consumption in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships 

china the world’s largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers currently has significant capacity surplus and many highcost plants as a result the domestic nitrogen industry in china is operating at less than full capacity if chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi the relaxation of chinese environmental standards or decreases in 

cf industries holdings inc 

chinese producers’ underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage increased production capacity utilization any resulting export volume could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our competitors in russia continue to benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas allowing continued exports from the region and have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity the 2016 revocations of us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia has allowed for increases in imports from that country in recent years 

we also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe latin america and africa who depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the international market for nitrogen products is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen products into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate including the imposition of new duties tariffs or quotas that affect foreign trade and investment for example the imposition of duties tariffs or quotas in a region can directly impact product pricing in that region which can lead to changes in global trade flows and impact the global supply and demand balance and pricing market participants customarily move product between regions of the world or adjust trade flows in response to these factors north america where we manufacture and sell most of our products is one of the largest and most liquid nitrogen trading regions in the world as a result other manufacturers traders and other market participants can move nitrogen products to north america when there is uncertainty over the supply and demand balance in other regions or when duties tariffs or quotas impact prices or trade flows in other regions as a result duties tariffs and quotas can lead to uncertainty in the global marketplace and impact the supply and demand balance in many regions which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in april 2019 the european commission the commission published a regulation imposing provisional antidumping duties on imports to the european union of uan manufactured in russia the republic of trinidad and tobago and the united states the regulation included a rate of 226 for the provisional antidumping duty applicable to imports of uan manufactured in the united states in july 2019 the commission announced its intention to impose definitive antidumping measures in the form of fixed duty rates for imports of uan manufactured in the united states the fixed duty rate is €2948 per metric ton or €2674 per ton on october 8 2019 the commission confirmed this duty in a regulation imposing definitive measures which became effective beginning october 9 2019 for an initial fiveyear period after which the measures may be renewed by the commission the impact of this duty on the international market for nitrogen products in the near and long term is uncertain 

a decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the demand for our products 

conditions in the united states europe india brazil china and other global agricultural areas significantly impact our operating results agricultural planted areas and production can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices crop disease andor livestock disease demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding production of or trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control 

governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies commodity support programs and tariffs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production various interested parties have called to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand 

developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate or nitrogenefficient varieties or developments in alternatives to traditional animal feed or alternative proteins could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products widespread adoption of emerging application technologies or alternative farming techniques could disrupt traditional application practices affecting the volume or types of products used and timing of applications in addition from time to time various state 

cf industries holdings inc 

legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including as a result of technological developments andor limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is dependent on natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility 

nitrogen from the atmosphere and hydrogen from natural gas coal or other carbon energy feedstocks are the fundamental building blocks of nitrogen fertilizers our manufacturing processes utilize natural gas as the principal raw material used in our production of nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea urea ammonium nitrate solution uan ammonium nitrate an and other nitrogen products 

most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada as a result north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2019  the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 182 per mmbtu on three consecutive days in december 2019 and a high of 412 per mmbtu on march 5 2019  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2019  the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 182 per mmbtu on three consecutive days in december 2019 and a high of 688 per mmbtu on january 4 2018  

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe which has also been volatile in recent years the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2019  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 236 per mmbtu on september 4 2019 and a high of 791 per mmbtu on january 17 2019  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2019  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 236 per mmbtu on september 4 2019 and a high of 3174 per mmbtu on march 2 2018  

changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to extended periods of higher natural gas prices if high prices were to persist especially during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices resulting in production of less associated gas 

certain of our operating facilities are located near natural gas hubs that have experienced increased natural gas development and have favorable basis differences as compared to other north american hubs favorable basis differences in certain regions may dissipate over time due to increases in natural gas pipeline or storage capacity in those regions additionally basis differentials may become materially unfavorable due to a lack of inbound gas pipeline or storage capacity in other regions during periods of unusually high demand increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production increased demand or changes in basis were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in north america or elsewhere natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and any delay or interruption in the delivery of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas and other raw materials in the manufacture of nitrogen products we purchase the natural gas and other raw materials from third party suppliers our natural gas is transported by pipeline to our facilities by third party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties delays or interruptions in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials may be caused by among other things severe weather or natural disasters unscheduled downtime labor difficulties insolvency of our suppliers or their inability to meet existing contractual arrangements deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents or mechanical failures in addition the transport of natural gas by pipeline is subject to additional risks including delays or interruptions caused by capacity constraints leaks or ruptures any delay or interruption in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials even for a limited period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cf industries holdings inc 

our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers and are subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight this exposes us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to additional liability 

we rely on natural gas pipelines to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities in addition we rely on railroad truck pipeline barge and vessel companies to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages shutdowns delays accidents such as spills and derailments vessel groundings and other accidents and operating hazards additionally due to the aging infrastructure of certain rail lines bridges roadways pipelines river locks and equipment that our third party service providers utilize we may experience delays in both the receipt of raw materials or the shipment of finished product while repairs maintenance or replacement activities are conducted also certain third party service providers such as railroads have experienced periodic service delays or shutdowns due to capacity constraints in their systems operational and maintenance difficulties weather or safetyrelated embargoes and delays and other events which could impact the shipping of our products and cause disruption in our supply chain for example in september 2019 the portion of the magellan midstream partners lp magellan ammonia pipeline that connects to our verdigris oklahoma complex was permanently shut down resulting in the loss of future distribution of verdigris ammonia production through this pipeline in addition we expect that the portion of the magellan ammonia pipeline that connects to our port neal iowa complex will permanently shut down in march 2020 which will result in the loss of future distribution of port neal ammonia production through this pipeline 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents discharges or other releases of hazardous substances terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives governmental entities could implement new or more stringent regulatory requirements affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products 

if shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies’ failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements were implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there were significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the united states and canada the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads’ potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads shift liability to shippers by contract purport to shift liability to shippers by tariff or otherwise seek to require shippers to indemnify and defend the railroads from and against liabilities including in negligence strict liability or statutory liability that may arise from certain acts or omissions of the railroads third parties who may have insufficient resources or the company unknown causes or acts of god these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads third parties or us for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new or more stringent regulatory requirements also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products restrictions on service increases in transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors and any railroad industry initiatives that may impact our ability to transport our products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacture transportation storage and distribution of chemical products including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled plant downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations for an extended period of time andor the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities

we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage there can be no assurance that we will be able to buy and maintain insurance with adequate limits and reasonable pricing terms and conditions 

in april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities were named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases were consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption “in re west explosion cases” the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325 individuals and 80 insurance companies plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities manufactured and sold to others were delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident the court granted in part and denied in part the cf entities’ motions for summary judgment in august 2015 over two hundred cases have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements that have been or we expect will be fully funded by insurance the remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pretrial proceedings the next group of cases was reset for trial beginning on september 14 2020  we believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the cf entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits the increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilities 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow prevent us from fulfilling our obligations and impair our ability to pursue or achieve other business objectives 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 40 billion of total funded indebtedness consisting primarily of secured and unsecured senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2021 and 2044 or approximately 41 of our total capitalization and an additional 750 million of senior secured borrowing availability reflecting no outstanding borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit for general corporate purposes under our senior secured revolving credit agreement as amended the revolving credit agreement our substantial debt service obligations will have an impact on our earnings and cash flow for so long as the indebtedness is outstanding 

our substantial indebtedness could as a result of our debt service obligations or through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it could

 we expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future if we incur additional indebtedness the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could intensify if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate our relations with our creditors including the holders of our outstanding debt securities the lenders under our revolving credit agreement and our suppliers may be materially and adversely affected 

a failure to satisfy the financial maintenance covenants under our revolving credit agreement or a breach of the covenants under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness could limit the borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement or result in an event of default under such agreements 

our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness including the consolidated interest coverage ratio and consolidated net leverage ratio maintenance covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement will depend upon our future performance and various other factors such as market prices for our nitrogen products natural gas prices and other business competitive and regulatory factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to maintain compliance with all of these covenants in that event we may not be able to access the borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement and we would need to seek an amendment to our debt agreements or would need to refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we can obtain future amendments or waivers of our debt agreements and instruments or refinance our debt and even if we were able to do so such relief might only last for a limited period potentially necessitating additional amendments waivers or refinancings any noncompliance by us with the covenants under our debt agreements and instruments could result in an event of default under those debt agreements and instruments an event of default under an agreement or instrument governing any of our indebtedness may allow our creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if our lenders or holders of our debt securities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we may be forced to liquidate certain assets to repay all or part of our indebtedness which could materially and adversely impair our business operations an event of default under our revolving credit agreement would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under our revolving credit agreement furthermore our revolving credit agreement and senior secured notes provide for liens on specified collateral to secure our obligations thereunder and if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under our revolving credit agreement or the senior secured notes our revolving credit agreement lenders or holders of the senior secured notes as applicable could proceed against the collateral granted to them which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness we cannot assure that we would have sufficient assets to make such repayment 

potential future downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital cause vendors to change their credit terms for doing business with us and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on us

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems and any technology disruption or cybersecurity incident could negatively affect our operations 

we rely on internal and thirdparty information technology and computer control systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications the management of our accounting financial and supply chain functions and plant operations if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach in addition our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees business partners customers or suppliers and may subject us to legal liability 

as with most large systems our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyber attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase to date we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations at one or more sites delay production and shipments result in the theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation result in legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy or other laws or increased costs for security and remediation or raise concerns regarding our accounting for transactions each of these consequences could adversely affect our business reputation and our financial statements 

our business involves the use storage and transmission of information about our employees customers and suppliers the protection of such information as well as our proprietary information is critical to us the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements we have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our employees customers or suppliers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us or our employees customers suppliers or other individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability these events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations 

weather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting growing harvesting or application periods may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following application period resulting in lower seasonal demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions during or following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers adverse weather conditions could also impact transportation of fertilizer which could disrupt our ability to deliver our products to customers on a timely basis our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in fertilizer applications planting schedules and purchasing patterns over the longerterm changes in weather patterns may shift the periods of demand for products and even the regions to which our products are distributed which could require us to evolve our distribution system 

in addition we use the north american waterway system extensively to ship products from some of our manufacturing facilities to our distribution facilities and our customers and we also export nitrogen fertilizer products via seagoing vessels from deepwater docking facilities at certain of our manufacturing sites therefore persistent significant changes in river or ocean water levels either up or down such as a result of flooding or drought for example may require changes to our operating and distribution activities andor significant capital improvements to our facilities 

cf industries holdings inc 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can disrupt our operations and can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products colder andor longer than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events can not only cause loss of power at our facilities disrupting our operations but also can impact the supply of natural gas and utilities and cause prices to rise 

tax matters including changes in tax laws or rates adverse determinations by taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in i the united states where most of our operations are located and ii numerous foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized or conduct business tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rate could also be affected by changes in our mix of earnings from countries with differing statutory tax rates and tax systems changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we have certain net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards collectively the tax loss carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income and thereby reduce cash taxes as a result of the effective usage of certain of these tax loss carryforwards to offset current cash taxes payable there are no us federal tax loss carryforwards remaining as of december 31 2019 as a result we expect an increase in cash taxes in 2020 before taking into account income tax refunds related to the settlement of the terra industries inc amended tax returns 

we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have used the cash we generate outside the united states primarily to fund development of our business in nonus jurisdictions if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the united states we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the united states under the tax laws of the foreign countries in which we operate those international earnings could be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated therefore the repatriation of those earnings could result in an increase in our worldwide effective tax rate and an increase in our use of cash to pay these taxes 

we also need to comply with other new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs or value added taxes or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” or “tax reform” the tax act significantly changes how the us taxes corporations the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act significant estimates in these calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies are in the process of issuing guidance on how the provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that could be different from the interpretation currently reflected in our financial statements or tax returns some of this guidance could be retroactive back to the effective date of the tax act as new or amended guidance is issued with respect to the tax act we may need to record adjustments to amounts previously recorded for taxes and such adjustments could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes in the period in which such adjustments are made 

in addition foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations

as a producer of nitrogen fertilizer products working with hazardous substances our business faces risks of spills discharges or other releases of those substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current facilities or facilities previously owned by us or other acquired businesses adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental health and safety laws change regularly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental health and safety laws and regulations we may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time our production distribution or storage of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our operations andor resulted in liability for administrative penalties andor claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses

beginning in 2018 the medicine hat nitrogen complex which had been subject to alberta’s specified gas emitters regulation became subject to alberta’s new carbon competitiveness incentive regulation ccir this regulation established productspecific benchmarks based on the most efficient ghg emitting facilities in a sector a facility with emissions that exceed the applicable benchmark was required to take action to reduce its ghg emissions intensity purchase emissions offsets or performance credits or make contributions to alberta’s climate fund in 2019 the new alberta government passed the technology innovation and emission reduction implementation act tier which replaced the ccir and went into effect on january 1 2020 the tier requires large emitting facilities other than electricity producers who are subject to a different standard to comply with the least stringent of a “facilityspecific” benchmark of 90 of historical ghg emissions intensity from a threeyear baseline which intensity limit will be reduced by 1 a year beginning in 2021 or a benchmark reflecting the emissions intensity of the top 10 of facilities for a given sector the compliance options under the tier are similar to the compliance options under ccir the federal government had formally determined that alberta’s ccir meets its stringency requirements and did not impose the outputbased performance system obps also called the “federal backstop” which is being implemented by environment and climate change canada eccc pursuant to the federal greenhouse pollution pricing act gppa that came into effect in june 2018 in december 2019 the federal government announced that the tier meets federal stringency benchmarking criteria for 2020 so the obps will not be imposed in alberta in addition the tier set the price for payments into its carbon fund at 30 per ton the same effective price as set in the ccir this could also result in regulated facilities in alberta being subject to the obps beginning in 2021 when the effective price of carbon pursuant to the obps rises to 40 per ton of excess co 2 e 

the courtright nitrogen complex had been subject to ontario’s ghg capandtrade program beginning in january 2017 but the conservative government elected in june 2018 rescinded that program in one of its first acts because ontario no longer had a ghg regulatory regime the federal government imposed the obps in the province beginning in 2019 in july 2019 the new ontario government enacted a new ghg regulation called the emissions performance standards program eps which sets co 2 e emissions limits for nitrogen products based on a productionweighted sectoral average for facilities whose carbon emissions exceed the applicable limits compliance options include the purchase of emissions performance units for a fee of 20 per ton of excess co 2 e for calendar year 2020 which fee will rise by 10 per ton each year through 2023 except for registration and recordkeeping provisions the eps will not go into effect until the federal government determines that the regulation satisfies the federal stringency requirements at which time the eps would replace the opbs in ontario 

with respect to the obps in june 2019 the eccc finalized the emissions limits for co 2 e emissions from nitrogen fertilizer products these emission limits are based on 95 of the average emissions intensity for the production of such products from all canadian nitrogen fertilizer plants reflecting that such products are deemed to be energyintensive and tradeexposed and thus subject to a less stringent emissions reduction requirement a facility whose carbon emissions exceed the applicable limits will be required to offset excess emissions by obtaining and retiring surplus emission credits obtaining qualifying emission offsets or paying a fee of 20 per ton of excess co 2 e for calendar year 2019 which fee will rise by 10 per ton each year through 2022 ontario and saskatchewan are challenging whether the federal government has jurisdiction to impose a federal carbon price on the provinces and territories the saskatchewan court of appeal in may 2019 and the ontario court of appeal in june 2019 each held that the gppa was validly enacted under the canadian constitution ontario and saskatchewan both appealed these decisions to the supreme court of canada and oral arguments are scheduled for march 2020 in june 2019 alberta filed a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the gppa notwithstanding that the question will be resolved by the pending supreme court appeals 

there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations in other jurisdiction including the united states on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement which was accepted by the united states and ratified by canada and the united kingdom went into effect in november 2016 in june 2017 the united states announced its intention to 

cf industries holdings inc 

withdraw from the paris agreement subject to renegotiation of the paris agreement on terms more favorable to the united states on november 4 2019 the united states submitted formal notice of its withdrawal from the paris agreement which will become effective on november 4 2020 to date the united states is the only signatory to withdraw from the paris agreement if the paris agreement remains in effect it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

more stringent ghg regulations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states canada or the united kingdom our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us 

we may not be successful in the expansion of our business 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both within the united states and elsewhere major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments require significant managerial resources the diversion of which from our other activities may impair the operation of our business we may be unable to identify or successfully compete for certain acquisition targets which may hinder or prevent us from acquiring a target or completing other transactions the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or business combination transactions are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments among the risks associated with the pursuit and consummation of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments or business combinations are those involving 

 international acquisitions partnerships joint ventures investments or business combinations and other international expansions of our business involve additional risks and uncertainties including but not limited to 



cf industries holdings inc 

 if we finance acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints under the terms of and as a result of the repayment and debtservice obligations under the additional indebtedness a business combination transaction between us and another company could result in our stockholders receiving cash or shares of another entity on terms that such stockholders may not consider desirable moreover the regulatory approvals associated with a business combination may result in divestitures or other changes to our business the effects of which are difficult to predict 

our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other fertilizer producers generally manufacture and distribute products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application seasons and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season 

if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations would be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price could be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from us 

a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assets 

any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months 

we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives and the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses 

we may utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased products we have used natural gas futures swaps and option contracts traded in overthecounter markets or on exchanges we have also used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts to hedge our exposure to natural gas price volatility in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may from time to time use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts 

our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidity 

hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies 

our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments or by the triggering of any cross default provisions or credit support requirements against us additionally the international swaps and derivative association master netting arrangements for most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position 

at other times we may not utilize derivatives or derivative strategies to hedge certain risks or to reduce the financial exposure of price volatility as a result we may not prevent certain material adverse impacts that could have been mitigated through the use of derivative strategies 

we are subject to risk associated with our strategic venture with chs inc chs 

we may not realize the full benefits from our strategic venture with chs that are expected the realization of the expected benefits of the chs strategic venture depends on our ability to operate and manage the strategic venture successfully and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with chs over the life of the agreement among other factors additionally any challenges related to the chs strategic venture could harm our relationships with chs or our other customers 

we are exposed to risks associated with our joint venture in point lisas nitrogen limited plnl 

we have a 50 ownership interest in plnl which owns and operates an ammonia production facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago our joint venture partner shares a measure of control over the operations of our plnl joint venture as a result our investment in our plnl joint venture involves risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our plnl joint venture or our partner have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to or have veto rights over our instructions requests policies or objectives subject our plnl joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business 

in addition we may become involved in disputes with our plnl joint venture partner which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

plnl’s ammonia plant relies on natural gas supplied under a gas sales contract the ngc contract by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture experienced past curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which reduced the ammonia production at plnl the ngc contract had an initial expiration date of september 2018 and was extended on the same terms until september 2023 any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will be based on new agreements failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc after 2023 on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture and could result in further impairment to the value of the joint venture such as ceasing operations and writing off the remaining investment in plnl which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

cf industries holdings inc 

in 2016 and 2015 we recognized impairment charges of 134 million and 62 million respectively related to plnl as part of our impairment assessments of our equity method investment in plnl the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2019 is 88 million  

acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives we are subject to various security laws and regulations in the united states these security laws include the maritime transportation security act of 2002 and the chemical facilities antiterrorism standards regulation in addition president obama issued in 2013 executive order 13650 improving chemical facility safety and security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen products that can be used as explosives it is possible that governmental entities in the united states or elsewhere could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen products thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for us 

in october 2016 the department of homeland security dhs released its new chemical security assessment tool csat 20 surveys and enhanced risk tiering methodology facilities that had previously submitted a survey response to the dhs were notified to resubmit responses to online questionnaires to be evaluated through the revised and enhanced risk tiering methodology in april 2017 the dhs began sending tiering determination letters to chemical facilities based on the new methodology we have submitted security plans to dhs for certain of our plants and terminals that have been identified as enhanced risks as a result of this process and anticipate based on comments received by dhs that we may be required to implement additional measures related to chemical security beyond what we have implemented at one or more of our facilities 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations 

our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions 

changes in governmental trade policies can lead to the imposition of new duties tariffs or quotas affecting agricultural commodities fertilizer or industrial products these can alter trade flows access to supplies or demand and regional balances for our products 

our principal reporting currency is the us dollar and our business operations and investments outside the united states increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change including for example in response to sudden global economic conditions resulting from measures like the referendum in the united kingdom in june 2016 which resulted in a vote in favor of exiting the european union brexit which is further discussed below we may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by among other things requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in or indexed to the us dollar or a currency freely convertible into us dollars or hedging through foreign currency derivatives these efforts however may not be effective and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

with regard to brexit on january 31 2020 the united kingdom left the european union eu while the united kingdom will no longer be a member of the eu it will still be subject to eu rules and remain a member of the customs union for a period of time as it negotiates the rules to be applied to future trading taxes and other relationships we operate two nitrogen manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom which utilize foreignsourced materials and equipment and which also export products in addition to serving customers in the united kingdom brexit including its indirect effects could impact 

cf industries holdings inc 

us in the future for example the cost and availability of natural gas or other raw materials or equipment that we purchase and the demand or selling prices for the nitrogen products that we sell could be impacted by additions deletions or changes to tariffs duties trade restrictions or other factors brexit could lead to changes in trade flows trading relationships the movement of production to alternative locations or the curtailment of certain production at certain sites it could also lead to changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate including as discussed above the risk of more stringent restrictions on ghg emissions brexit could also impact foreign exchange rates or uk interest rates which could impact our operations or the valuation of our assets and liabilities since the uk referendum in june 2016 the united kingdom has experienced increases in the volatility of foreign exchange rates which impacts our operations as discussed above as a result of the uncertainty of brexit including its indirect effects changes in the future profitability asset utilization or business valuation of our uk operations could negatively impact us and may result in an impairment of our longlived assets or goodwill as of december 31 2019  longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets related to the united kingdom were 708 million  and goodwill was 275 million  

we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs in various jurisdictions including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 the canadian corruption of foreign public officials act and economic sanctions programs administered by the united nations the european union and the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury and regulations set forth under the comprehensive iran accountability divestment act as a result of doing business internationally we are exposed to a risk of violating anticorruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we our partners or agents operate violations of anticorruption and sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and termination of existing contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment the violation of applicable laws by our employees consultants agents or partners could subject us to penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation administration and enforcement will change over time changes in antitrust laws globally or in their interpretation administration or enforcement may limit our existing or future operations and growth 

deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers’ reluctance to replenish inventories changes in global economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such changes can be difficult to ascertain resulting in anxiety among market participants that can persist for protracted periods for example concern and uncertainty over the impact of brexit on the global economy has resulted in increased volatility in global financial markets the overall impact of changes in global economic conditions on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted

west fertilizer co 

on april 17 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities were named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases were consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption “in re west explosion cases” the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325 individuals and 80 insurance companies plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities manufactured and sold to others were delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident 

the court granted in part and denied in part the cf entities’ motions for summary judgment in august 2015 over two hundred cases have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements that have been or we expect will be fully funded by insurance the remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pretrial proceedings the next group of cases was reset for trial beginning on september 14 2020  we believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the cf entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits the company cannot provide a range of reasonably possible loss due to the lack of damages discovery for many of the remaining claims and the uncertain nature of this litigation including uncertainties around the potential allocation of responsibility by a jury to other defendants or responsible third parties the recognition of a potential loss in the future in the west fertilizer co litigation could negatively affect our results in the period of recognition however based upon currently available information including available insurance coverage we do not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply and demand factors 

our products are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition the customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality the selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions changes in supply and demand and cost factors 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth gross domestic product growth changes in dietary habits planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand growth may depend on global economic conditions farm sector income weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption fertilizer application rates and governmental regulations including fertilizer subsidies or requirements mandating increased use of biofuels or industrial nitrogen products other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key exportingconsuming countries such as china india russia and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of nitrogenbased fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal therefore supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for these commodities 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental trade policies including the imposition of duties tariffs or quotas that affect foreign trade or investment the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last decade has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east the republic of trinidad and tobago north africa and russia have been major exporters to north america in recent years as a result the north american nitrogen fertilizer market is dependent on imports to balance supply and demand

farmers’ economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns crop prices fertilizer products used and timing of applications expected yields and the types of crops planted 

items affecting comparability of results 

selling prices 

the us gulf is a major global fertilizer pricing point due to the volume of nitrogen fertilizer that trades there in 2018 higher energy costs in asia and europe along with continued enforcement of environmental regulations in china resulted in lower nitrogen production in these regions in addition plant outages impacted the global nitrogen supply and demand balance these factors collectively drove global nitrogen prices higher in the second half of 2018 

upon entering the first quarter of 2019 our average selling prices were higher than the first quarter of 2018 driven by the continued impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance experienced throughout late 2018 during the first half of 2019 our average selling prices for all fertilizer products remained strong due to the limited supply of fertilizer as high water levels and flooding impacted shipping and logistics on the us inland rivers and limited access for imports as we entered the third quarter of 2019 the fertilizer application season extended due to the late planting resulting in continued inseason prompt sales which favorably impacted our third quarter selling prices however as the third quarter continued lower global energy prices resulted in higher nitrogen industry operating rates which increased global fertilizer supply this factor in conjunction with the seasonally slow third quarter period led to weakness in selling prices as the third quarter ended which continued throughout the fourth quarter of 2019 in addition to low selling prices the fourth quarter of 2019 experienced cold and wet weather which limited fall ammonia application these factors collectively led to lower nitrogen prices in the fourth quarter 

the average selling price for our products for 2019 and 2018 was 235 per ton and 229 per ton respectively the increase in average selling prices of 3 in 2019 from 2018 increased net sales by 62 million  

sales volume 

persistent cold and wet weather across most of north america early in 2019 delayed spring planting activity and fertilizer applications in addition high water levels impacted shipping and logistics on the us inland rivers and delayed certain barge shipments which caused delays in certain customers taking delivery of fertilizer and other customers delaying purchases as a result the spring application season extended into the third quarter of 2019 with some shipments that would typically occur in the second quarter being delayed into the third quarter additionally planned maintenance activity at our plants reduced production levels in the third quarter of 2019 reducing inventory availability in the fourth quarter shipping activity increased and full year sales volume for 2019 was 195 million tons 1 higher than the 193 million tons in 2018  

sales volume for our products in 2019  2018 and 2017 is shown in the table below 

the increase in total sales volume in 2019 from 2018 was due primarily to the impact of increased supply resulting from both higher inventory levels entering 2019 and higher production in 2019 the increase in sales volume increased net sales by 99 million in 2019

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce nitrogen products natural gas is a significant cost component of manufactured nitrogen products representing approximately 35 of our production costs 

most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada as a result the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america have declined over the last decade but are subject to volatility the average daily market price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america was 251 per mmbtu for 2019 compared to 312 per mmbtu for 2018  a decrease of 20  

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp the average daily market price at nbp was 444 per mmbtu for 2019 compared to 807 per mmbtu for 2018  a decrease of 45  the price of natural gas in the united kingdom has declined as a result of increased production and availability of liquefied natural gas in the global market due to higher gas exports from exporting nations including the united states 

natural gas costs in cost of sales including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives was 274 per mmbtu in 2019  a 13 decrease from 316 per mmbtu in 2018  which resulted in an increase in gross margin of approximately 153 million  

other items affecting comparability of results 

during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  certain items impacted our financial results the following table and related discussion outline these items and how they impacted the comparability of our financial results during these periods positive amounts in the table below are costs or expenses incurred while negative amounts are income recognized in the periods presented 

 

 

cf industries holdings inc 

the following describes the significant items that impacted the comparability of our financial results in 2019 and 2018  descriptions of items below that refer to amounts in the table above refer to the pretax amounts except for the discussion under income taxes  

unrealized net marktomarket loss gain on natural gas derivatives 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile single component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased products at certain times we have managed the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivatives that we may use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps basis swaps and options we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting this can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations in 2019 and 2018  we recognized an unrealized net marktomarket loss gain on natural gas derivatives of 14 million and 13 million  respectively 

gain on foreign currency transactions including intercompany loans 

in 2019 and 2018  we recognized gains of 1 million and 5 million  respectively from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily canadian dollar and british pound denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested 

gain on sale of pine bend facility 

during the first quarter of 2019 we entered into an agreement to sell our pine bend dry bulk storage and logistics facility in minnesota in april of 2019 we completed the sale received proceeds of 55 million and recognized a pretax gain of 45 million  the gain is reflected in other operating—net in our consolidated statement of operations 

insurance proceeds 

in 2019 and 2018  we recognized income of 37 million and 10 million  respectively related to insurance claims at one of our nitrogen complexes the 37 million of income in 2019 consists of 22 million related to business interruption insurance proceeds and 15 million related to property insurance proceeds the 10 million of income in 2018 is related to property insurance proceeds these proceeds are reflected in other operating—net in our consolidated statements of operations 

losses on debt extinguishment 

on november 13 2019 we redeemed all of the 500 million outstanding principal amount of the 7125 senior notes due may 2020 the 2020 notes in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2020 notes on december 13 2019 we redeemed 250 million principal amount representing 50 of the 500 million outstanding principal amount of the 3400 senior secured notes due december 2021 the 2021 notes in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2021 notes as a result of the early redemption of the 2020 notes and the 2021 notes we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 21 million  of which 12 million related to the 2020 notes and 9 million related to the 2021 notes 

income taxes 



cf industries holdings inc 

our us deferred tax balances which resulted in an income tax benefit of 552 million that was recorded in 2017 in addition tax reform required us to pay us tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings foreign earnings held in the form of cash and cash equivalents are taxed at a 155 rate and the remaining earnings are taxed at an 8 rate we elected to pay the transition tax in installments through 2025 as a result we recognized a provisional charge and liability of 57 million in 2017 a 16 million increase to the provisional amount of the transition tax liability was recorded in 2018 

plnl withholding tax charge 

the trinidadian tax authority the board of inland revenue issued a proposed tax assessment against plnl our joint venture in the republic of trinidad and tobago with respect to tax years 2011 and 2012 in the amount of approximately 12 million the proposed assessment asserted that plnl should have withheld tax at a higher rate on dividends paid to its trinidadian owners the board of inland revenue also would have assessed statutory interest and penalties on the amount of tax owed when a final assessment was issued for the tax years 2011 and 2012 as we own a 50 interest in plnl our effective share of any assessment that is determined to be a liability of plnl would be 50 which would be reflected as a reduction in our equity in earnings of plnl 

during the third quarter of 2019  the trinidadian government offered a tax amnesty period that provided taxpayers the opportunity to pay any prior year tax obligations and avoid accumulated interest or penalties during the tax amnesty period plnl evaluated the proposed assessment including considering the outcome of certain recent legal cases involving other taxpayers as a result of this evaluation plnl paid withholding tax to the board of inland revenue under the amnesty program for tax years 2011 to the current period and recognized a charge for 32 million in the third quarter of 2019 our 50 share of plnl’s tax charge is 16 million  which reduced our equity in earnings of operating affiliates for 2019  

plnl settlement income 

plnl operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied under a gas sales contract the ngc contract by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc plnl experienced past curtailments in the supply of natural gas which reduced historical ammonia production at plnl the ngc contract had an initial expiration date of september 2018 and was extended on the same terms until september 2023 any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will be based on new agreements in may 2018 the ngc and plnl reached a settlement of an arbitration proceeding regarding plnl’s claims for damages due to natural gas supply curtailments the net aftertax impact of the settlement reached between ngc and plnl that is recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for 2018 was an increase in our equity in earnings of operating affiliates of approximately 19 million  

financial executive summary 

we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 493 million in 2019 compared to 290 million in 2018  an increase in net earnings of 70  or 203 million  diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders was 223 in 2019 compared to 124 in 2018  an increase of 80  or 099 per share the increase in net earnings of 203 million was due primarily to the following

net sales 

our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

our total net sales increased 161 million  or 4  to 459 billion in 2019 compared to 443 billion in 2018 due to a 1 increase in sales volume which increase d net sales by 99 million  and a 3 increase in average selling prices which increase d net sales by 62 million  

average selling prices were 235 per ton in 2019 compared to 229 per ton in 2018  an increase of 3  due primarily to higher average selling prices in our uan granular urea and an segments partially offset by lower average selling prices in our ammonia and other segments the increase in average selling prices was driven by the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance the increase in total sales volume of 1 was due primarily to higher sales volumes in our ammonia an and other segments partially offset by lower sales volumes in our uan and granular urea segments 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

our cost of sales decreased 96 million  or 3  in 2019 from 2018  the decrease in our cost of sales was due primarily to the impact of lower realized natural gas costs partially offset by higher costs related to maintenance activity higher distribution costs and an unrealized net marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives of 14 million in 2019 compared to an unrealized net marktomarket gain of 13 million in 2018  the cost of sales per ton averaged 175 in 2019  a 4 decrease from 182 per ton in 2018  realized natural gas costs including the impact of realized derivatives decreased 13 to 274 per mmbtu in 2019 from 316 per mmbtu in 2018  

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees including those for corporate initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses increase d 25 million to 239 million in 2019 from 214 million in 2018  the increase was due primarily to costs related to certain corporate office initiatives and certain equity award modifications 

other operating—net 

other operating—net includes administrative costs that do not relate directly to our central operations costs included in “other operating costs” can include foreign exchange gains and losses unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives costs associated with our closed facilities amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets 

other operating—net was 73 million of income in 2019 compared to 27 million of income in 2018  the income in 2019 was due primarily to the 45 million pretax gain recognized on the sale of the pine bend facility and insurance proceeds of 37 million  see “items affecting comparability of results—gain on sale of pine bend facility and —insurance proceeds” above for additional information the income in 2018 was due primarily to the combination of changes in legal reserves insurance proceeds of 10 million and a gain of 6 million from the recovery of certain precious metals used in the manufacturing process

equity in loss earnings of operating affiliates 

equity in loss earnings of operating affiliates primarily consists of our 50 ownership interest in plnl we include our share of the net earnings from our equity method investment in plnl as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition 

equity in loss earnings of operating affiliates was 5 million of losses in 2019 compared to 36 million of earnings in 2018  the loss in 2019 includes approximately 16 million related to a withholding tax charge recognized by plnl regarding a multiyear tax dispute see “items affecting comparability of results—plnl withholding tax charge” above for additional information 

earnings in 2018 includes approximately 19 million related to the net aftertax impact of a settlement reached between ngc and plnl of an arbitration proceeding regarding plnl’s claims for damages due to historical natural gas supply curtailments see “items affecting comparability of results—plnl settlement income” above for additional information 

interest expense—net 

our interest expense—net includes the interest expense on our longterm debt amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements annual fees pursuant to our revolving credit agreement and interest on tax liabilities capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the facility along with all other construction costs interest expense—net also includes interest income which includes amounts earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments 

net interest expense decreased by 11 million to 217 million in 2019 from 228 million in 2018  the decrease was due to 5 million of interest income related to the settlement of the terra amended tax returns which is more fully described under “liquidity and capital resources—settlement of terra amended tax returns” below in addition the decrease reflects our redemption in november 2019 of all of the 500 million outstanding principal amount of the 2020 notes and the partial redemption in december 2019 of 250 million principal amount of the 2021 notes 

losses on debt extinguishment 

on november 13 2019 we redeemed all of the 500 million outstanding principal amount of the 2020 notes in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2020 notes on december 13 2019 we redeemed 250 million principal amount representing 50 of the outstanding principal amount of the 2021 notes in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2021 notes as a result of the early redemption of the 2020 notes and the 2021 notes we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 21 million  of which 12 million related to the 2020 notes and 9 million related to the 2021 notes 

income tax provision 

our income tax provision for 2019 was 126 million on pretax income of 772 million  or an effective tax rate of 163 compared to an income tax provision of 119 million on pretax income of 547 million  or an effective tax rate of 217 in 2018  

our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in cfn and in the first quarter of 2018 by earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests in tnclp as our consolidated income tax provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests our effective tax rate for 2019 of 163 which is based on pretax income of 772 million  would be 203 exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest of 153 million  our effective tax rate for 2018 of 217  which is based on pretax income of 547 million  would be 291 exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of 138 million  

for 2019  our income tax provision includes an incentive tax credit from the state of louisiana of 30 million net of federal income tax related to certain capital projects at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and an income tax benefit of 10 million related to the favorable settlement of certain uncertain tax positions related to the terra amended tax returns which is more fully described under “liquidity and capital resources—settlement of terra amended tax returns” below 

our effective tax rate for 2018 was impacted by a 16 million increase to the provisional amount recorded in 2017 for the transition tax liability as result of the enactment of the tax act 

cf industries holdings inc 

on april 2 2018 we acquired the tnclp public units our effective tax rate in 2018 was impacted by a 16 million reduction to our deferred tax liability due to the change in our effective state income tax rate resulting from the implementation of legal entity structure changes related to the acquisition 

both 2019 and 2018 were impacted by additional discrete tax items see note 10—income taxes for additional information

capital spending 

we make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base increase our capacity improve plant efficiency and comply with various environmental health and safety requirements capital expenditures were 404 million in 2019 compared to 422 million in 2018  

capital expenditures in 2020 are estimated to be in the range of 400 to 450 million planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting unanticipated increases in cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties delay in the receipt of equipment adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties 

government policies 

the policies or laws of governments around the world can result in the imposition of taxes duties tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world the policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers or farmers due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic political and social objectives additionally the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity the impact of changes in governmental policies or laws or the political or social objectives of a country could have a material impact on fertilizer demand and selling prices and therefore could impact our liquidity 

ethanol industry and the renewable fuel standard 

corn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 38 of total us corn demand us government policy as expressed in the renewable fuel standard rfs is a major determinant for the ethanol market the rfs establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels including ethanol that must be included in the united states’ supply of fuel for transportation in addition the us congress at various times has proposed legislation to either modify or eliminate the rfs while past legislation proposing changes to the rfs has not been enacted into law there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be enacted into law other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol gasoline and corn lower gasoline prices and fewer aggregate miles driven by increased automobile fuel efficiency may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry which could impact the demand for corn and nitrogen fertilizer and therefore could impact our liquidity 

settlement of terra amended tax returns 

the company completed the acquisition of terra in april 2010 after the acquisition the company determined that the manner in which terra reported the repatriation of cash from foreign affiliates to its us parent for us and foreign income tax purposes was not appropriate as a result in 2012 the company amended certain tax returns including terra’s income and withholding tax returns back to 1999 the amended tax returns to correct these tax returns and paid additional income and withholding taxes and related interest and penalties in early 2013 the irs commenced an examination of the us tax aspects of the amended tax returns in 2017 the company also made a voluntary disclosure filing with the canadian revenue agency cra with respect to the canadian tax aspects of this matter and paid additional canadian taxes due 

in early 2019 the irs completed its examination of the amended tax returns and submitted its audit reports and related refund claims to the joint committee for purposes of its review the joint committee separated the irs audit reports into two separate matters i an income tax related matter and ii a withholding tax matter 

in december 2019 we received notification that the joint committee had approved the irs audit reports relating to the income tax related matter as a result we expect to receive a cash refund in the first half of 2020 of approximately 57 million  including interest as a result of the approval by the joint committee the company recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019 interest income of 5 million  4 million  net of tax and a reduction in income tax expense of 10 million as a result of the favorable settlement of certain uncertain tax positions 

the joint committee has not yet approved the irs audit report relating to the withholding tax matter if this approval is received we expect to receive an additional tax refund of approximately 29 million excluding related interest and record a reduction in income tax expense of approximately 12 million 

the company previously recorded a tax receivable of cad 27 million or 21 million related to the canadian tax aspects of this matter which continues to be under review by the cra

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

we have operations in canada the united kingdom and a 50 interest in a joint venture in the republic of trinidad and tobago historically the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us were recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings were recognized unless the earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested based upon our then current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurred at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings could occur in different periods 

in light of changes made by the tax act commencing with the 2018 tax year the united states no longer taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries even when such earnings are earned or repatriated to the united states unless such earnings are subject to us rules on passive income or certain antiabuse provisions foreign subsidiary earnings may still be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated to the united states 

cash balances held by our joint venture are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint venture on a periodic basis 

as of december 31 2019  approximately 42 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 287 million was held by our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries historically the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represented accumulated earnings of our foreign operations that were not considered to be permanently reinvested as of december 31 2019  as a result of the amounts accrued in the transition tax liability recorded in 2017 and 2018 as a result of the tax act we would not expect any additional cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian and united kingdom cash balances if we were to repatriate this cash in the future other than foreign withholding tax 

net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2018 we had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards collectively the tax loss carryforwards of 271 million these tax loss carryforwards are available to reduce taxable income and thereby reduce cash taxes in the united states and other tax jurisdictions in which they can be applied as a result of the effective usage of certain of these tax loss carryforwards to offset current cash taxes payable there are no us federal tax loss carryforwards remaining as of december 31 2019 as a result we expect an increase in cash taxes in 2020 before taking into account income tax refunds related to the settlement of the terra amended tax returns

forward sales and customer advances 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose therefore our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contract’s value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time control transfers to the customer thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until control transfers and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we had 119 million and 149 million  respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets 

while customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers’ outlook of future market fundamentals during periods of declining prices customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the current prices if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase additionally borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity 

under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customer’s inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs for example natural gas costs including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 35 of our total production costs in 2019  as a result natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity 

because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america have declined in the last decade but are subject to volatility during 2019  the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 182 per mmbtu on three consecutive days in december 2019 and a high of 412 per mmbtu on march 5 2019  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2019  the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 182 per mmbtu on three consecutive days in december 2019 and a high of 688 per mmbtu on january 4 2018  

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national 

cf industries holdings inc 

balancing point nbp during 2019  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 236 per mmbtu on september 4 2019 and a high of 791 per mmbtu on january 17 2019  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2019  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 236 per mmbtu on september 4 2019  and a high of 3174 per mmbtu on march 2 2018  

natural gas costs in our cost of sales including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives decreased 13 per mmbtu in 2019 from 2018  

derivative financial instruments 

we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers from time to time we may also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives in 2019 and 2018  we recognized an unrealized net marktomarket loss gain on natural gas derivatives of 14 million and 13 million  respectively which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 

derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks other major financial institutions or large energy companies and the use of international swaps and derivatives association isda master netting arrangements the isda agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for overthecounter derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk in part by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement 

the isda agreements for most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support thresholds in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position the revolving credit agreement at any time when it is secured provides a cross collateral feature for those of our derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to or affiliates of parties to the revolving credit agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives in the event the revolving credit agreement becomes unsecured separate collateral could be required in connection with such derivatives 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 12 million and zero  respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates as of december 31 2019  our open natural gas derivative contracts consisted of natural gas fixed price swaps basis swaps and options for 411 million mmbtus as of december 31 2018  we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 66 million mmbtus of natural gas basis swaps at both december 31 2019 and 2018  we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts the credit support documents executed in connection with certain of our isda agreements generally provide us and our counterparties the right to set off collateral against amounts owing under the isda agreements upon the occurrence of a default or a specified termination event 

embedded derivative liability 

under the terms of our strategic venture with chs if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels we are required to make a nonrefundable yearly payment of 5 million to chs since 2016 our credit ratings have been below certain levels and as a result we made an annual payment of 5 million to chs in the fourth quarter of each year these payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or february 1 2026 

this obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as an embedded derivative and its value is included in other liabilities see note 9—fair value measurements for additional information

cash flows 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was 1505 million as compared to 1497 million in 2018  an increase of 8 million  the increase was due primarily to an increase in cash earnings generated by the business partially offset by changes in working capital the increase in cash earnings is due primarily to the increase in net earnings of 218 million to 646 million in 2019 from 428 million in 2018  the increase in net earnings was due primarily to lower realized natural gas costs higher average selling prices and higher sales volume the amounts of cash used to fund working capital changed between 2019 and 2018 cash used for working capital purposes increased in 2019 as 112 million of cash was used primarily to fund an increase in inventory and accounts receivable and to fund a decrease in accounts payable accrued liabilities and customer advances in 2018 127 million of cash was provided due to lower working capital levels such as declines in accounts receivable and increases in customer advances accounts payable and accrued liabilities in addition we contributed 61 million to our pension plans in 2019 compared to 39 million in 2018  an increase of 22 million

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources see “recent accounting pronouncements” below for a discussion of our january 1 2019 adoption of accounting standards update asu no 201602 leases topic 842 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap us gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

income taxes 

we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period in which these changes occur 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

historically a deferred income tax liability was recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and joint venture that were considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income tax liability was recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and joint venture which we believed to be permanently reinvested in light of changes made by the tax act the company continues to evaluate whether it will continue to treat foreign subsidiary earnings as being permanently reinvested 

as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation in the countries in which we operate changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and foreign joint venture that could be subjected to us taxation it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods 

we operate in a number of countries and as a result have a significant amount of cross border transactions the taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators in countries across the globe including the countries in which we operate the tax rules and regulations within the various countries in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various countries as a result there are instances where regulators within the countries involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances we work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions however there are instances where reaching a common understanding is not possible or practical as of december 31 2019  we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits including penalties and interest of 137 million  which includes certain potential tax exposures involving cross border transactions this amount represents our best estimate of the potential amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions differences in 

cf industries holdings inc 

interpretation of the tax laws including agreements between governments surrounding our cross border transactions can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimates 

recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating rates operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review 

the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value and the reduction in value is other than temporary the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earnings 

plnl is our joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied under the ngc contract by ngc the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method the joint venture experienced past curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which reduced the ammonia production at plnl the ngc contract had an initial expiration date of september 2018 and was extended on the same terms until september 2023 any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will be based on new agreements if ngc does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to plnl at prices that permit profitable operations plnl may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in plnl 

in 2016 and 2015 we recognized impairment charges of 134 million and 62 million respectively related to plnl as part of our impairment assessments of our equity method investment in plnl the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2019 is 88 million  

the uk government held a referendum on the uk’s membership in the european union eu in june 2016 which resulted in the electorate voting in favor of the uk exit from the eu brexit on january 31 2020 the united kingdom left the eu while the united kingdom will no longer be a member of the eu it will still be subject to eu rules and remain a member of the customs union for a period of time as it negotiates the rules to be applied to future trading taxes and other relationships we operate two nitrogen manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom which utilize foreignsourced materials and equipment and which also export products in addition to serving customers in the united kingdom brexit including its indirect effects could impact us in the future for example the cost and availability of natural gas or other raw materials or equipment that we purchase and the demand or selling prices for the nitrogen products that we sell could be impacted by additions deletions or changes to tariffs duties trade restrictions or other factors brexit could lead to changes in trade flows trading relationships the movement of production to alternative locations or the curtailment of certain production at certain sites brexit could also impact foreign exchange rates or uk interest rates which could impact our operations or the valuation of our assets and liabilities since the uk referendum in june 2016 the united kingdom has experienced increases in the volatility of foreign exchange rates which impacted our operations as a result of the uncertainty of brexit including its indirect effects changes in the future profitability asset utilization or business valuation of our uk operations could negatively impact us and may result in an impairment of our longlived assets or goodwill as of december 31 2019  longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets related to the united kingdom was 708 million  and goodwill primarily included in our an segment was 275 million  

we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further analysis is necessary however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test which involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of 

cf industries holdings inc 

the reporting unit is considered not impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill impairment would be recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit we identified no goodwill impairment in 2019  2018 or 2017  as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the carrying value of our goodwill was 237 billion and 235 billion  respectively 

intangible assets identified in connection with our 2010 acquisition of terra consist of customer relationships which are being amortized over a period of 18 years the intangible assets identified in connection with our 2015 acquisition of cf fertilisers uk consist of customer relationships and trade names which are being amortized over a period of approximately 20 years our intangible assets are presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets see note 7—goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized key assumptions that affect our projected benefit obligation pbo are discount rates and in addition for our united kingdom plans an adjusted retail price index rpi key assumptions affecting pension expense include discount rates the expected longterm rate of return on assets eroa and in addition for our united kingdom plans rpi 

the december 31 2019 pbo was computed based on a weightedaverage discount rate of 31 for our north america plans and 20 for our united kingdom plans which were based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo the weightedaverage discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2019 was 41 for north america plans and 29 for united kingdom plans our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 46 weightedaverage eroa used to calculate pension expense in 2019 for our north america plans is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods the 44 weightedaverage eroa used to calculate pension expense in 2019 for our united kingdom plans is based on expected longterm performance of underlying investments the eroa for both north america and united kingdom plans are adjusted for expenses and diversification bonuses for our united kingdom plans the 30 rpi used to calculate our pbo and the 33 rpi used to calculate 2019 pension expense are developed using the bank of england implied retail price inflation curve which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and indexlinked government bonds 

for north america qualified pension plans our pbo was 839 million as of december 31 2019  which was 49 million higher than pension plan assets for our united kingdom pension plans our pbo was 597 million as of december 31 2019 which was 179 million higher than pension plan assets the tables below estimate the impact of a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the key assumptions on our december 31 2019 pbo and 2019 pension expense

see note 3—new accounting standards for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements including our january 1 2019 adoption of asu no 201602 leases topic 842 which requires lessees to recognize the rights and obligations resulting from virtually all leases other than leases that meet the definition of a shortterm lease on their balance sheets as rightofuse assets with corresponding lease liabilities 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to nitrogenbased fertilizers are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea uan 32 and an by approximately 33 21 15 and 15 respectively 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily with the use of derivative financial instruments the derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps basis swaps and options these derivatives settle using primarily a nymex futures price index which represents the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods as of december 31 2019  we had natural gas fixed price swaps basis swaps and options covering certain periods through march 2020 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we had open derivative contracts for 411 million mmbtus and 66 million mmbtus respectively a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas at december 31 2019 would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of 17 million  and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by 19 million  

from time to time we may purchase nitrogen products on the open market to augment or replace production at our facilities 

interest rates 

as of december 31 2019  we had six series of senior notes totaling 400 billion of principal outstanding with maturity dates of december 1 2021  june 1 2023  december 1 2026  march 15 2034  june 1 2043 and march 15 2044  the senior notes have fixed interest rates as of december 31 2019  the carrying value and fair value of our senior notes was approximately 396 billion and 429 billion respectively 

borrowings under our revolving credit agreement bear current market rates of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2019 or 2018 or during 2019 or 2018 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we are directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro we generally do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

we operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners’ equity interests in cf industries were canceled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock 

in april 2010 we acquired terra industries inc terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities an approximately 753 interest in tnclp and certain joint venture interests 

in march 2014 we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was located in florida to mosaic inc for approximately 14 billion in cash 

in july 2015 we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk  not previously owned by us for total consideration of 570 million  and cf fertilisers uk  became wholly owned by us 

cf industries holdings inc 

in february 2016 our strategic venture with chs commenced at which time chs made a capital contribution of 28 billion  to cfn in exchange for membership interests in cfn which represented approximately 11 of the total membership interests of cfn 

in 2016 we completed capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa which increased our production capacity by approximately 25 for a total capital cost of 52 billion 

in 2018 we announced that tngp elected to exercise its right to purchase the tnclp public units tngp completed the purchase on april 2 2018 for an aggregate cash purchase price of 388 million upon completion of the purchase cf holdings owned through its subsidiaries 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of tnclp 

product tons and nutrient tons 

unless otherwise stated we measure our production and sales volume in this annual report on form 10k in product tons which represents the weight of the product measured in short tons one short ton is equal to 2000 pounds references to uan product tons assume a 32 nitrogen content basis for production volume 

we also provide certain supplementary volume information measured in nutrient tons nutrient tons represent the weight of the product’s nitrogen content which varies by product ammonia represents 82 nitrogen content granular urea represents 46 nitrogen content uan represents between 28 and 32 nitrogen content and an represents between 29 and 35 nitrogen content 

reportable segments 

our reportable segments consist of the following segments ammonia granular urea uan an and other these segments are differentiated by products we use gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources total other operating costs and expenses consisting of selling general and administrative expenses and other operating—net and nonoperating expenses interest and income taxes are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management see note 21—segment disclosures  for additional information 

our products 

our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia granular urea uan and an our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the following table net sales do not reflect amounts used internally such as ammonia in the manufacture of other products 

 

 gross margin was 917 million  434 million  and 843 million  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

we own and operate seven nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in north america including five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in the united states one in medicine hat alberta canada and one in courtright ontario canada as of december 31 2018  the combined production capacity of these seven facilities represented approximately 41 42 44 and 19 of north american ammonia granular urea uan and an production capacity respectively each of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in north america has onsite storage to provide flexibility to manage the flow of outbound shipments without impacting production we also operate two united kingdom nitrogen manufacturing facilities located in billingham and ince that produce ammonia an and npks and serve primarily the british agricultural and industrial markets

point lisas trinidad 

the point lisas nitrogen facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago is owned jointly through a 5050 venture with koch fertilizer llc this facility has the capacity to produce 720000 tons of ammonia annually from natural gas supplied under a contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc 

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in 2018  natural gas accounted for approximately 40  of our total production costs for nitrogen fertilizer products our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities have access to abundant competitivelypriced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities our facilities utilize the following natural gas hubs henry hub in louisiana sonat in louisiana tetco ela in louisiana oneok in oklahoma aeco in alberta ventura in iowa demarcation in kansas welcome in minnesota dawn in ontario parkway in ontario and the national balancing point nbp in the united kingdom 

in 2018  our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consumed in the aggregate approximately 347 million mmbtus of natural gas we employ a combination of daily spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced supply of natural gas we also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices see note 15—derivative financial instruments  for additional information about our natural gas hedging activities 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the safe efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer products to terminals warehouses and customers each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location 

our north american nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and to our storage facilities in the us and canada with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5000 tank and hopper cars as well as railcars provided by rail carriers our united kingdom nitrogen production facilities mainly ship products via truck 

the north american waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our donaldsonville verdigris and yazoo city facilities to ship ammonia and uan we employ a fleet of eleven tow boats and thirtytwo river barges which are primarily leased we also utilize contract marine services to move urea fertilizer we can also export nitrogen fertilizer products via seagoing vessels from our donaldsonville yazoo city billingham and ince manufacturing facilities 

three of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia the donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2000mile long nustar pipeline through which we have the ability to transport ammonia to ten terminals and shipping points in the midwestern us corn belt our verdigris and port neal facilities are connected to the 1100mile long magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the midwestern united states on january 31 2019 magellan midstream partners lp announced its decision to discontinue commercial operations of the ammonia pipeline beginning in late 2019

storage facilities and other properties 

as of december 31 2018  we owned or leased space at 61  inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 22state region of the united states canada and the united kingdom including storage at our production facilities we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately 33 million  tons of product our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table 



 

 customers 

the principal customers for our nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products are cooperatives independent fertilizer distributors traders wholesalers farmers and industrial users chs was our largest customer in 2018  and accounted for approximately 14  of our consolidated net sales sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force 

competition 

our markets are global and intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

our primary north americanbased competitors include nutrien ltd formed in january 2018 by the merger of agrium inc and potash corporation of saskatchewan inc koch fertilizer llc and iowa fertilizer company in addition yara basf started up a new north american nitrogen fertilizer production facility in april 2018 there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition from foreignsourced products continuously 

our primary united kingdom competition comes from imported products supplied by companies including yara international origin fertilisers ameropa chs and helm urea and uan are not produced in the united kingdom but along with an are widelytraded fertilizer products with limited barriers to entry 

seasonality 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to weather conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other fertilizer producers generally manufacture and distribute products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom the european union and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act tsca and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment we may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future 

environmental health and safety expenditures 

our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2018  totaled approximately 40 million we estimate that we will have approximately 60 million of capital expenditures for environmental health and safety in 2019  environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cerclaremediation matters 

from time to time we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws in 2011 we received a notice from the idaho department of environmental quality ideq that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho the current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site we and the current owner are currently conducting a remedial investigationfeasibility study of the site in 2015 we and several other parties received a notice that the us department of interior and other trustees intend to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for a group of former phosphate mines in southeast idaho including the former georgetown canyon mine see note 20—contingencies  for additional information on the cerclaremediation matters 

regulation of greenhouse gases 

we are subject to regulations in the united kingdom the european union canada and the united states concerning greenhouse gas ghg emissions 

the united kingdom is a party to the kyoto protocol as a result of agreements reached during a conference in durban south africa in 2011 the kyoto protocol will continue in force for a second commitment period which will expire by 2020 on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15°c above preindustrial levels the paris agreement which has been accepted by the united states and ratified by canada and the united kingdom went into effect in november 2016 the paris agreement could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the united kingdom has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas emission trading system eu ets our uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require these plants to purchase co 2  emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our uk sites are also subject to the eu ets however the continued applicability of the eu ets in the united kingdom is uncertain due to the potential exit of the united kingdom from the european union brexit 

cf industries holdings inc 

canada withdrew from further participation in the kyoto protocol in december 2011 but is a party to the paris agreement in canada we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canada’s national pollutant release inventory and ontario’s mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation in 2018 the federal greenhouse pollution pricing act came into effect pursuant to which the canadian department of the environment will implement the outputbased performance standard obps which is intended to function as a backstop to provincial greenhouse gas emissions regulations the department of the environment is currently proposing that the benchmark for nitrogen fertilizer plants be set at 90 of the average performance of canadian fertilizer plants in the provinces and territories where the obps will apply a facility whose carbon emissions exceed this benchmark will be required to offset emissions by obtaining and retiring surplus emission credits obtaining qualifying emissions offsets or paying a fee of 20 per ton of excess carbon dioxide equivalent co 2 e for calendar year 2019 which fee will rise by 10 per ton for each year through 2022 

in january 2017 ontario launched its own ghg cap and trade program and beginning january 1 2018 ontario’s cap and trade program was linked with the cap and trade programs in quebec and california our courtright nitrogen complex was subject to the ontario cap and trade program however the government elected in ontario in june 2018 rescinded the cap and trade program because ontario no longer has a ghg regulatory regime the federal government will impose the obps in the province the federal government intends to finalize the obps in the first half of 2019 and then retroactively apply it to january 2019 in impacted provinces ontario and saskatchewan are challenging whether the federal government has jurisdiction to impose a federal carbon price on the provinces and territories 

in alberta the specified gas emitters regulation was implemented in 2007 this program required facilities emitting more than 100000 tons of ghgs per year to reduce emissions by 12 over such facilities’ 2007 levels to meet this requirement companies could reduce emissions purchaseuse offset credits or contribute to a technology fund at an annual rate of 15 per ton of co 2  beginning in 2018 our medicine hat nitrogen complex became subject to the carbon competitiveness incentive regulation ccir this regulation establishes productspecific benchmarks based on the most efficient ghg emitting facilities in a sector a facility with emissions that exceed the applicable benchmark will be required to take action to reduce its ghg emissions intensity purchase emissions offsets or performance credits or make contributions to alberta’s climate fund the federal government has determined that alberta’s ccir meets its stringency requirements so that the federal obps will not apply in alberta in 2019 however the government of alberta has not determined whether it will agree to increase the effective price of carbon beyond the current price of 30 per ton of excess co 2 e this could result in regulated facilities in alberta being subject to the obps beginning in 2021 when the effective price of carbon pursuant to the greenhouse pollution pricing act rises to 40 per ton of excess co 2 e 

the united states is not a party to the kyoto protocol but is a party to the paris agreement however in june 2017 the united states announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement subject to renegotiation of the paris agreement on terms more favorable to the united states under the terms of the paris agreement the united states cannot formally provide notice of its withdrawal before november 2019 which would become effective one year after providing such notice in the interim it is unclear if the united states will comply with its commitments under the paris agreement there has been no indication to date that the united states’ announced withdrawal is causing other countries to also consider withdrawing from the paris agreement in the united states ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels although some of the more significant developments to date including epa’s clean power plan which the current administration has proposed to rescind do not directly impose obligations on our facilities the epa has issued a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and reporting the previous year’s emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result are required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd construction permit applicable to such facilities we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to ghgs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects other than the states’ implementation of this permitting requirement none of the states where our us production facilities are locatediowa louisiana mississippi and oklahomahas proposed control regulations limiting ghg emissions 

new source performance standards for nitric acid plants 

we operate 14 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides nox notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals more stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand for nitrogen is affected by planted acreage crop selection and fertilizer application rates driven by population growth or changes in dietary habits and nonfood use of crops such as production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things demand also includes industrial uses of nitrogen for example chemicals manufacturing and emissions reductants such as diesel exhaust fluid def supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade 

periods of strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to stimulate global investment in production capacity fertilizer producers including cf holdings have built new production facilities or expanded capacity of existing production assets or announced plans to do so the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply availability and affect the balance of supply and demand in recent years global nitrogen fertilizer capacity has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating a surplus of global nitrogen fertilizer capacity leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices for example in the twoyear period ended december 31 2017 additional production capacity came on line and at the same time the average selling price for our products declined 34 from 314 per ton in 2015 to 207  per ton in 2017  

additional production capacity is expected to come on line over the next 12 months primarily outside of north america we cannot predict the impact of this additional capacity also global or local economic and financial conditions or changes in such conditions or other factors may cause acceleration of other announced andor ongoing projects 

price fluctuations for our products result from changes in supply and demand significant price fluctuations we experience could be symptoms of an oversupplied market in transition as new capacity ramps up and production slows down or shuts down in high cost regions additionally trade flows adjust as imports into different regions of the world also impact the local supply and demand balances if imports increase into an oversupplied region lower prices in that region could result 

during periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production in recent years our financial performance credit ratings and the trading price for our common stock were negatively impacted by the lower selling prices resulting from the global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer while the average selling price for our products has increased 11  in 2018  to 229  per ton compared to 207  per ton in 2017  the period of time that these oversupply conditions will persist and the degree to which they will impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows is uncertain 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality as a consequence conditions in the international market for nitrogen products significantly influence our operating results 

we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities consolidation in the industry may increase the resources of several of our competitors for example in january 2018 our competitors agrium inc and potash corporation of saskatchewan inc completed their merger into the newly formed company nutrien ltd some of our competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships 

china the world’s largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers currently has significant capacity surplus and many highcost plants as a result the domestic nitrogen industry in china is operating at less than full capacity if chinese 

cf industries holdings inc 

government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi or decreases in chinese producers’ underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage increased production capacity utilization any resulting export volume could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our competitors in russia continue to benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas allowing continued exports from the region and have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity the 2016 revocations of us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia has allowed for increases in imports from that country in recent years 

we also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe latin america and africa who depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the international market for nitrogen products is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen products into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate including the imposition of new duties tariffs or quotas that affect foreign trade and investment for example the european union is currently conducting an antidumping inquiry of uan producers in the united states trinidad and tobago and russia the result of this inquiry and its impact if any on the international market for nitrogen products is uncertain in addition it is uncertain as to whether additional inquiries or other actions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizer if any would have an adverse impact on the international market for our products 

a decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the demand for our products 

conditions in the united states europe and other global agricultural areas significantly impact our operating results agricultural planted areas and production can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding production of or trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control 

governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies commodity support programs and tariffs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing “food versus fuel” debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand 

developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate or nitrogenefficient varieties or developments in alternatives to traditional animal feed or alternative proteins could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products widespread adoption of emerging application technologies or alternative farming techniques could disrupt traditional application practices affecting the volume or types of products used and timing of applications in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including as a result of technological developments andor limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is dependent on natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea urea ammonium nitrate solution uan ammonium nitrate an and other nitrogen products 

because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2018  the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded 

cf industries holdings inc 

natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 248  per mmbtu on four consecutive days in february 2018 and a high of 688  per mmbtu on january 4 2018  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2018  the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 149  per mmbtu on three consecutive days in march 2016 and a high of 688  per mmbtu on january 4 2018  

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe which has also been volatile in recent years the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2018  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 660  per mmbtu on two consecutive days in january 2018 and a high of 3174  per mmbtu on march 2 2018  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2018  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 280  per mmbtu on september 1 september 12 and september 14 2016 and a high of 3174  per mmbtu on march 2 2018  

changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to extended periods of higher natural gas prices if high prices were to persist especially during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas 

certain of our plants are located near natural gas hubs that have experienced increased natural gas development and have favorable basis differences as compared to other north american hubs favorable basis differences in certain regions may dissipate over time due to increases in natural gas pipeline or storage capacity in those regions additionally basis differentials may become materially unfavorable due to a lack of inbound gas pipeline or storage capacity in other regions during periods of unusually high demand increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production increased demand or changes in basis were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states or elsewhere natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations and those of our joint venture are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and any delay or interruption in the delivery of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we and our joint venture use natural gas and other raw materials in the manufacture of nitrogen products we purchase the natural gas and other raw materials from third party suppliers our natural gas is transported by pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint venture by third party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties delays or interruptions in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials may be caused by among other things severe weather or natural disasters unscheduled downtime labor difficulties insolvency of our suppliers or their inability to meet existing contractual arrangements deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents or mechanical failures our joint venture point lisas nitrogen limited has experienced natural gas curtailments as discussed in the risk factor below titled “we are exposed to risks associated with our joint venture” in addition the transport of natural gas by pipeline is subject to additional risks including delays or interruptions caused by capacity constraints leaks or ruptures any delay or interruption in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials even for a limited period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers and are subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight this exposes us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to additional liability 

we rely on railroad truck pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and operating hazards additionally due to the aging infrastructure of certain rail lines bridges roadways pipelines river locks and equipment that our third party service providers utilize we may experience delays in both the receipt of raw materials or the shipment of finished product while repairs maintenance or replacement activities are conducted also certain 

cf industries holdings inc 

third party service providers particularly railroads have experienced periodic service slowdowns due to capacity constraints in their systems operational and maintenance difficulties and other events which impact the shipping times of our products 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents discharges or other releases of hazardous substances terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives governmental entities could implement new or more stringent regulatory requirements affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products 

if shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies’ failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the united states and canada the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads’ potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads shift liability to shippers by contract purport to shift liability to shippers by tariff or otherwise seek to require shippers to indemnify and defend the railroads from and against liabilities including in negligence strict liability or statutory liability that may arise from certain acts or omissions of the railroads third parties with insufficient resources unknown causes or acts of god these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads or third parties for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new or more stringent regulatory requirements also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products restrictions on service increases in transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors and any railroad industry initiatives that may impact our ability to transport our products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacture transportation storage and distribution of chemical products including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled plant downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations for an extended period of time andor the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage there can be no assurance that we will be able to buy and maintain insurance with adequate limits and reasonable pricing terms and conditions 

in april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities were named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases were consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption “in re west explosion cases”

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow prevent us from fulfilling our obligations and impair our ability to pursue or achieve other business objectives 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 470 billion  of total funded indebtedness consisting primarily of secured and unsecured senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2020 and 2044 or approximately 45  of our total capitalization and an additional 746 million  of senior secured borrowing availability reflecting no outstanding borrowings and 4 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our senior secured revolving credit agreement as amended the revolving credit agreement our substantial debt service obligations will have an impact on our earnings and cash flow for so long as the indebtedness is outstanding 

our substantial indebtedness could through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it could 

 we expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

our revolving credit agreement and the terms of our outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

our revolving credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions include covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries other than certain excluded subsidiaries to among other things 

  in addition our revolving credit agreement requires us to comply with consolidated interest coverage ratio total debt to capital ratio and consolidated secured leverage ratio maintenance covenants 

certain of these restrictions could be suspended if and for so long as we satisfy certain investment grade corporate rating and consolidated leverage tests however we cannot assure you that we will meet these tests or if we do that we will be able to maintain compliance with those conditions 

as a result of these restrictions and covenants under our existing indebtedness including our senior secured notes we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include additional or more restrictive covenants we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants under the terms of our indebtedness or if we fail to do so that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend such covenants 

we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 

the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur additional debt in the future including additional secured and unsecured indebtedness the indentures governing our senior secured notes do not limit incurrence by us of additional unsecured indebtedness and will permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness subject to certain restrictions although our revolving credit agreement contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness these restrictions are subject to exceptions and qualifications which allow us to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness in limited amounts if we incur additional indebtedness the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could intensify if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate our relations with our creditors including the holders of our outstanding debt securities the lenders under our revolving credit agreement and our suppliers may be materially and adversely affected 

a breach of the covenants under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under such agreements 

our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness will depend upon our future performance and various other factors such as market prices for our nitrogen products natural gas prices and other business competitive and regulatory factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to maintain compliance with all of these covenants in that event we would need to seek an amendment to our debt agreements or would need to refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we can obtain future amendments or waivers of our debt agreements and instruments or refinance our debt and even if we were able to do so such relief might only last for a limited period potentially necessitating additional amendments waivers or refinancings any noncompliance by us with the covenants under our debt agreements and instruments could result in an event of default under those debt agreements and instruments an event of default under an agreement or instrument governing any of our indebtedness may allow our creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if our lenders or holders of our debt securities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we may be forced to liquidate certain assets to repay all or part of our indebtedness which could materially and adversely impair our business operations an event of default under our revolving credit agreement would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under our revolving credit agreement furthermore our revolving credit agreement and senior secured notes provide for liens on specified collateral to secure our obligations thereunder and if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under our revolving credit agreement or the senior secured notes our revolving credit agreement lenders or holders of the senior secured notes as applicable could proceed against the collateral granted to them which could have a material

adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness we cannot assure that we would have sufficient assets to make such repayment 

potential future downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

as of february 14 2019  our corporate credit rating by sp global ratings is bb with a stable outlook our corporate credit rating by moody’s investor services inc is ba2 with a stable outlook and our corporate credit rating with fitch ratings inc is bb with a stable outlook 

these ratings and our current credit condition affect among other things our ability to access new capital especially debt and negative changes in these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt our credit ratings were downgraded in 2016 and rating agencies could further downgrade our credit ratings or issue adverse commentaries in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity in particular a weakening of our financial condition including a significant increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook or otherwise increase our cost of borrowing 

cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results 

we rely on internal and thirdparty information technology and computer control systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications the management of our accounting financial and supply chain functions and plant operations business and supply chain disruptions plant and utility outages and information technology system and network disruptions due to cyber attacks could seriously harm our operations and materially adversely affect our operating results cyber security risks include attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers damage or loss of information due to viruses the unintended disclosure of confidential information the misuse or loss of control over computer control systems and breaches due to employee error our exposure to cyber security risks includes exposure through third parties including any cloudbased technologies on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we routinely review and implement security procedures and measures in order to protect our systems and information from being vulnerable to evolving cyber attacks we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate prevent or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks compromises to our information and control systems could have severe financial and other business implications 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations 

weather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting growing harvesting or application periods may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following application period resulting in lower seasonal demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions during or following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers adverse weather conditions could also impact transportation of fertilizer which could disrupt our ability to deliver our products to customers on a timely basis our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns over the longerterm changes in weather patterns may shift the periods of demand for products and even the regions to which our products are distributed which could require us to evolve our distribution system 

in addition we use the north american waterway system extensively to ship products from some of our manufacturing facilities to our distribution facilities and our customers and we also export nitrogen fertilizer products via seagoing vessels from deepwater docking facilities at certain of our manufacturing sites therefore persistent significant changes in river or ocean water levels either up or down such as a result of flooding or drought for example may require changes to our operating and distribution activities andor significant capital improvements to our facilities 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products colder andor longer than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freezeoffs or hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise

tax matters including changes in tax laws or rates adverse determinations by taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in the united states where most of our operations are located and numerous foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized tax rates in various jurisdictions in which we operate may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in our mix of earnings from countries with differing statutory tax rates and tax systems changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the irs and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the united states although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have used the cash we generate outside the united states primarily to fund development of our business in nonus jurisdictions if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the united states we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the united states under the tax laws of the foreign countries in which we operate those international earnings would be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated therefore the repatriation of those earnings could result in an increase in our worldwide effective tax rate and an increase in our use of cash to pay these taxes 

we also need to comply with other new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs or value added taxes or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” or “tax reform” the tax act significantly changes how the us taxes corporations the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act and significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies are in the process of issuing guidance on how the provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that could be different from the interpretation currently reflected in our financial statements or tax returns as new or amended guidance is issued with respect to the tax act we may need to record adjustments to amounts previously recorded for taxes and such adjustments could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes in the period in which such adjustments are made 

in addition foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

the united states and other countries in which we operate are in the process of implementing the organization for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting project beps beps is intended to improve tax disclosure and transparency and eliminate structures and activities that could be perceived by a particular country as resulting in tax avoidance each country is permitted to introduce its own legislation to implement beps as a number of our business operations do business across country lines we are subject to beps the implementation of beps could result in tax changes and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes results of operations and cash flows 

we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities 

our nitrogen fertilizer operations are located at nine separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represented approximately 40  of our ammonia production capacity as of december 31 2018  the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane or high wind activity and several of our complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to affect adversely the shipping and distribution of our products moreover our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace or have long delivery lead times and could result in operational disruptions

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws regulations and permitting requirements as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom the european union and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international laws 

as a producer of nitrogen fertilizer products working with hazardous substances our business faces risks of spills discharges or other releases of those substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current facilities or facilities previously owned by us or other acquired businesses adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental health and safety laws change regularly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental health and safety laws and regulations we may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion or modification of our operations is predicated upon securing necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval or a determination that we have violated a law or permit as a result of a governmental inspection of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at our facilities and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states in the united states our existing facilities currently are only subject to ghg emissions reporting obligations although our new and modified facilities are likely to be subject to ghg emissions standards included in their air permits our facilities in the united kingdom are subject to the european union emissions trading system eu ets which generally require us to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset ghg emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program the continued applicability of the eu ets in the united kingdom is uncertain due to the potential exit of the united kingdom from the european union brexit which could result in more stringent ghg regulations than those imposed by the eu ets 

beginning in 2018 the medicine hat nitrogen complex which had been subject to alberta’s specified gas emitters regulation became subject to alberta’s new carbon competitiveness incentive regulation ccir this regulation establishes productspecific benchmarks based on the most efficient ghg emitting facilities in a sector a facility with emissions that exceed the applicable benchmark is required to take action to reduce its ghg emissions intensity purchase emissions offsets or performance credits or make contributions to alberta’s climate fund the obligations under this regulation are being phased in over a threeyear period and will be tightened over time the federal government formally determined that alberta’s ccir

meets its stringency requirements and so will not impose the outputbased performance system obps also called the “federal backstop” which is being implemented by environment and climate change canada eccc pursuant to the federal greenhouse pollution pricing act “gppa” that came into effect in june 2018 however the government of alberta has not determined whether it will agree to increase the effective price of carbon beyond the current price of 30 per ton of excess carbon dioxide equivalent co 2 e this could result in regulated facilities in alberta being subject to the obps beginning in 2021 when the effective price of carbon pursuant to the gppa rises to 40 per ton of excess co 2 e  

  the courtright nitrogen complex had been subject to ontario’s ghg capandtrade program beginning in january 2017 but the new conservative government elected in june 2018 rescinded that program in one of its first acts because ontario no longer has a ghg regulatory regime the federal government imposed the obps in the province beginning in 2019 eccc is currently proposing that the benchmark for nitrogen fertilizer plants will be set at 90 of the average performance of all canadian fertilizer plants a facility whose carbon emissions exceed this benchmark will be required to offset excess emissions by obtaining and retiring surplus emission credits obtaining qualifying emission offsets or paying a fee of 20 per ton of excess co 2 e for calendar year 2019 which fee will rise by 10 per ton each year through 2022 ontario and saskatchewan are challenging whether the federal government has jurisdiction to impose a federal carbon price on the provinces and territories 

there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations in other jurisdiction including the united states on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement which has been accepted by the united states and ratified by canada and the united kingdom went into effect in november 2016 however in june 2017 the united states announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement subject to renegotiation of the paris agreement on terms more favorable to the united states under the terms of the paris agreement the united states cannot formally provide notice of its withdrawal before november 2019 which would become effective one year after providing such notice in the interim it is unclear if the united states will comply with its commitments under the paris agreement there has been no indication to date that the united states’ announced withdrawal is causing other countries to also consider withdrawing from the paris agreement if the paris agreement remains in effect it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

more stringent ghg regulations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states canada or the united kingdom our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us 

we may not be successful in the expansion of our business 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both within the united states and elsewhere major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments require significant managerial resources the diversion of which from our other activities may impair the operation of our business we may be unable to identify or successfully compete for certain acquisition targets which may hinder or prevent us from acquiring a target or completing other transactions the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or business combination transactions are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments among the risks associated with the pursuit and consummation of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments or business combination transactions are those involving 



cf industries holdings inc 

 international acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combinations or investments and other international expansions of our business involve additional risks and uncertainties including but not limited to 

 if we finance acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints under the terms of and as a result of the repayment and debtservice obligations under the additional indebtedness a business combination transaction between us and another company could result in our stockholders receiving cash or shares of another entity on terms that such stockholders may not consider desirable moreover the regulatory approvals associated with a business combination may result in divestitures or other changes to our business the effects of which are difficult to predict 

our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other fertilizer producers generally manufacture and distribute products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season 

if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from us 

cf industries holdings inc 

a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assets 

any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months 

we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives and the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses 

we may utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased products we have used futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts 

our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidity 

we have also used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts to hedge our exposure to natural gas price volatility hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies 

our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments or by the trigger of any cross default provisions or credit support requirements additionally the international swaps and derivative association master netting arrangements for most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position 

at other times we may not utilize derivatives or derivative strategies to hedge certain risks or to reduce the financial exposure of price volatility as a result we may not prevent certain material adverse impacts that could have been mitigated through the use of derivative strategies 

we are subject to risk associated with our strategic venture with chs inc 

we may not realize the full benefits from our strategic venture with chs that are expected the realization of the expected benefits of the chs strategic venture depends on our ability to operate and manage the strategic venture successfully and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with chs over the life of the agreement among other factors additionally any challenges related to the chs strategic venture could harm our relationships with chs or our other customers

we are exposed to risks associated with our joint venture 

we have a 50 ownership interest in plnl which owns and operates an ammonia production facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago our joint venture partner shares a measure of control over the operations of our plnl joint venture as a result our investment in our plnl joint venture involves risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our plnl joint venture or our partner have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to or have veto rights over our instructions requests policies or objectives subject our plnl joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business 

in addition we may become involved in disputes with our plnl joint venture partner which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

plnl’s ammonia plant relies on natural gas supplied under a gas sales contract the ngc contract by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture experienced past curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which reduced the ammonia production at plnl the ngc contract had an initial expiration date of september 2018 and was extended on the same terms until september 2023 any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will be based on new agreements in may 2018 the ngc and plnl reached a settlement of an arbitration proceeding regarding plnl’s claims for damages due to natural gas supply curtailments 

as part of our impairment assessments of our equity method investment in plnl we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a 134 million  impairment charge in 2016 and a 62 million impairment charge in 2015 related to our equity method investment in plnl the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2018  is 93 million  failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc after 2023 on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture and could result in further impairment to the value of the joint venture such as ceasing operations and writing off the remaining investment in plnl which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives we are subject to various security laws and regulations in the united states these security laws include the maritime transportation security act of 2002 and the chemical facilities antiterrorism standards regulation in addition president obama issued in 2013 executive order 13650 improving chemical facility safety and security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen products that can be used as explosives it is possible that governmental entities in the united states or elsewhere could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen products thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for us 

in october 2016 the department of homeland security dhs released its new chemical security assessment tool csat 20 surveys and enhanced risk tiering methodology facilities that had previously submitted a survey response to the dhs were notified to resubmit responses to online questionnaires to be evaluated through the revised and enhanced risk tiering methodology in april 2017 the dhs began sending tiering determination letters to chemical facilities based on the new methodology depending on the risk classification resulting from the application of csat 20 our plants and terminals could be subject to more stringent requirements related to chemical security

we are subject to risks associated with international operations 

our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions 

changes in governmental trade policies can lead to the imposition of new duties tariffs or quotas affecting agricultural commodities fertilizer or industrial products these can alter trade flows access to supplies or demand and regional balances for our products 

our principal reporting currency is the us dollar and our business operations and investments outside the united states increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change including for example in response to sudden global economic conditions resulting from measures like the referendum in the united kingdom in june 2016 which resulted in a vote in favor of exiting the european union brexit which is further discussed below we may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by among other things requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in or indexed to the us dollar or a currency freely convertible into us dollars or hedging through foreign currency derivatives these efforts however may not be effective and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

with regard to brexit a process of negotiation is now taking place to determine the future terms of the united kingdom’s relationship with the european union with the united kingdom due to exit the european union on march 29 2019 we operate two nitrogen manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom which utilize foreignsourced materials and equipment and which also export products in addition to serving customers in the united kingdom brexit including its indirect effects could impact us in the future for example the cost and availability of natural gas or other raw materials or equipment that we purchase and the demand or selling prices for the nitrogen products that we sell could be impacted by changes in tariffs duties trade restrictions or other factors brexit could lead to changes in trade flows trading relationships the movement of production to alternative locations or the curtailment of certain production at certain sites it could also lead to changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate including the risk of more stringent restrictions on ghg emissions as discussed above brexit could also impact foreign exchange rates or uk interest rates which could impact our operations or the valuation of our assets and liabilities since the uk referendum in june 2016 the united kingdom has experienced increases in the volatility of foreign exchange rates which impacts our operations as discussed above as a result of the uncertainty of brexit including its indirect effects changes in the future profitability asset utilization or business valuation of our uk operations could negatively impact us and may result in an impairment of our longlived assets or goodwill as of december 31 2018 longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets and goodwill related to the united kingdom were 742 million and 264 million respectively 

we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs in various jurisdictions including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 the canadian corruption of foreign public officials act and economic sanctions programs administered by the united nations the european union and the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury and regulations set forth under the comprehensive iran accountability divestment act as a result of doing business internationally we are exposed to a risk of violating anticorruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we our partners or agents operate violations of anticorruption and sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and termination of existing contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment the violation of applicable laws by our employees consultants agents or partners could subject us to penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation administration and enforcement will change over time changes in antitrust laws globally or in their interpretation administration or enforcement may limit our existing or future operations and growth

deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers’ reluctance to replenish inventories changes in global economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such changes can be difficult to ascertain resulting in anxiety among market participants that can persist for protracted periods for example concern and uncertainty over the potential impact of brexit on the global economy has resulted in increased volatility in global financial markets the overall impact of changes in global economic conditions on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted

west fertilizer co 

on april 17 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities were named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases were consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption “in re west explosion cases” the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325 individuals and 80 insurance companies plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities manufactured and sold to others were delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident 

the court granted in part and denied in part the cf entities’ motions for summary judgment in august 2015 over two hundred cases have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements that have been or we expect will be fully funded by insurance the remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pretrial proceedings the next group of cases was reset for trial beginning on july 23 2019 we believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the cf entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits the company cannot provide a range of reasonably possible loss due to the lack of damages discovery for many of the remaining claims and the uncertain nature of this litigation including uncertainties around the potential allocation of responsibility by a jury to other defendants or responsible third parties the recognition of a potential loss in the future in the west fertilizer co litigation could negatively affect our results in the period of recognition however based upon currently available information including available insurance coverage we do not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

overview of cf holdings 

our company 

we are a leading global fertilizer and chemical company our 3000 employees operate worldclass manufacturing complexes in canada the united kingdom and the united states our principal customers are cooperatives independent fertilizer distributors traders wholesalers farmers and industrial users our principal nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia granular urea urea ammonium nitrate solution uan and ammonium nitrate an our other nitrogen products include diesel exhaust fluid def urea liquor nitric acid and aqua ammonia which are sold primarily to our industrial customers and compound fertilizer products npks which are solid granular fertilizer products for which the nutrient content is a combination of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium we serve our customers in north america through our production storage transportation and distribution network we also reach a global customer base with exports from our donaldsonville louisiana plant the world’s largest and most flexible nitrogen complex additionally we move product to international destinations from our verdigris oklahoma facility our yazoo city mississippi facility and our billingham and ince facilities in the united kingdom and a joint venture ammonia facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago in which we own a 50 percent interest 

our principal assets include 



cf industries holdings inc 

 our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in verdigris oklahoma is owned and operated by terra nitrogen limited partnership tnlp prior to april 2 2018 tnlp was a subsidiary of terra nitrogen company lp tnclp which was a publicly traded limited partnership of which we were the sole general partner and the majority limited partner and in which we owned an approximate 753 interest 

on february 7 2018 we announced that in accordance with the terms of tnclp’s first amended and restated agreement of limited partnership as amended by amendment no 1 to the first amended and restated agreement of limited partnership the tnclp agreement of limited partnership terra nitrogen gp inc tngp the sole general partner of tnclp and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of cf holdings elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4612562 publicly traded common units of tnclp the tnclp public units tngp completed its purchase of the tnclp public units on april 2 2018 the purchase for an aggregate cash purchase price of 388 million we funded the purchase with cash on hand upon completion of the purchase cf holdings owned through its subsidiaries 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of tnclp 

industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply and demand factors 

our products are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition the customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality the selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions changes in supply and demand and different cost factors 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth gross domestic product growth changes in dietary habits planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand growth may depend on global economic conditions farm sector income weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption fertilizer application rates and governmental regulations including fertilizer subsidies or requirements mandating increased use of biofuels or industrial nitrogen products other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key exportingconsuming countries such as china india russia and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of nitrogenbased fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal therefore supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for these commodities 

strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity at times global nitrogen fertilizer capacity increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating a surplus of global nitrogen capacity in the market and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental trade policies including the imposition of duties tariffs or quotas that affect foreign trade or investment the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last decade has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america including our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa which 

cf industries holdings inc 

were completed in december 2016 changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east the republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa russia and china have been major exporters to north america in recent years 

farmers’ economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns crop prices fertilizer products used and timing of applications expected yields and the types of crops planted 

items affecting comparability of results 

nitrogen fertilizer selling prices 

the us gulf is a major global fertilizer pricing point due to the volume of nitrogen fertilizer that trades there through most of 2016 nitrogen pricing at the us gulf declined often trading below parity with other international pricing points due to the combination of new global nitrogen production capacity that came on line in 2016 continued imports from various exporting regions and decreased north american buyer interest as a result of greater global nitrogen supply availability seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multiyear lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of 2016 in 2017 the significant price fluctuations we experienced continued and were symptoms of a market in transition as new capacity came on line and global trade flows began to adjust 

in 2018 higher energy costs in asia and europe along with continued enforcement of environmental regulations in china resulted in lower nitrogen production in these regions in addition outages impacted the nitrogen supply and demand balance these factors collectively drove global nitrogen prices higher throughout 2018 

the average selling price for our products for 2018  2017  and 2016  was 229  per ton 207  per ton and 217  per ton respectively the increase in average selling prices of 11  in 2018  from 2017  increased net sales by 520 million the decline in average selling prices in 2017  from 2016  reduced net sales by 293 million 

sales volume 

in the first quarter of 2018 drought conditions in the southern plains along with wet and cold temperatures throughout much of the midwestern united states and the united kingdom delayed the spring application season and impacted sales volume this delay in the spring application season resulted in high inventory levels both entering and through much of the second quarter as volume typically shipped in the first quarter was instead shipped in the second quarter of 2018 after the delayed spring application season through the first nine months of 2018 sales volume for our products was essentially unchanged compared to the first nine months of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2018 our sales volume declined 11  compared to the prior year fourth quarter due primarily to the impact of unfavorable weather conditions in the northern plains and the midwestern united states which limited fall fertilizer applications of ammonia and the impact of lower ammonia and an production due to plant turnaround and maintenance activity 

sales volume for our products in 2018  2017  and 2016  is shown in the table below 

cf industries holdings inc 

the decrease in sales volume in 2018  from 2017  was due primarily to the impact in the fourth quarter of 2018 of unfavorable weather conditions in the northern plains and the midwestern united states in addition the volume decline reflects lower ammonia and an production primarily in the fourth quarter of 2018  as a result of plant turnaround and maintenance activity the decline in sales volume decreased net sales by 221 million  in 2018  the increase in total sales volume in 2017  from 2016  was due primarily to higher ammonia and granular urea sales volumes driven by increased production from the completion of our capacity expansion projects in december 2016 this increase in sales volume increased net sales by 738 million in 2017  

other items affecting comparability of results 

during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  certain significant items impacted our financial results the following table and related discussion outline these significant items and how they impacted the comparability of our financial results during these periods positive amounts in the table below are costs or expenses incurred while negative amounts are income recognized in the periods presented 



 



cf industries holdings inc 

the following describes the significant items that impacted the comparability of our financial results in 2018  2017  and 2016  descriptions of items below that refer to amounts in the table above refer to the pretax amounts except for the discussion under tax cuts and jobs act  

unrealized net marktomarket gain loss on natural gas derivatives 

natural gas is typically the largest and most volatile single component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased products we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivatives that we may use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps natural gas basis swaps and natural gas options we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting this can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations in 2018  2017  and 2016  we recognized unrealized net marktomarket gains losses on natural gas derivatives of 13 million  61 million  and 260 million  respectively 

gain loss on foreign currency transactions including intercompany loans 

in 2018  2017  and 2016  we recognized gains losses of 5 million  2 million  and 93 million  respectively from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily british pound and canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested 

insurance proceeds 

in 2018  we recognized income of 10 million  related to a property insurance claim at one of our nitrogen complexes these proceeds are reflected in other operating—net in our consolidated statement of operations 

acquisition of the tnclp public units 

in 2018  we incurred 2 million  of costs for various legal services associated with the acquisition of the publicly traded common units of tnclp these costs are reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 

beginning in the second quarter of 2018 as a result of the april 2 2018 acquisition of the tnclp public units there are no longer earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in tnclp in 2018  2017  and 2016  earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in tnclp was 8 million  19 million  and 26 million  respectively

loss on embedded derivative liability 

under the terms of our strategic venture with chs if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels we are required to make a nonrefundable yearly payment of 5 million to chs since our credit ratings were below certain levels in 2016 2017 and 2018 we made a payment of 5 million to chs in each year these payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or february 1 2026 this obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as an embedded derivative included in other operating — net in our consolidated statements of operations in 2017  and 2016  is a net loss of 4 million  and 23 million  respectively the impact to our consolidated statement of operations in 2018  is immaterial 

tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” or “tax reform” which includes a number of changes to us tax law that affect us as a result of the tax act we recognized a 491 million  income tax benefit in 2017 and an income tax charge of 16 million in 2018 these impacts generally resulted from the following items 

 debt activity 

on december 1 2017 we redeemed all of the 800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6875 senior notes due may 2018 the 2018 notes in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 notes the total aggregate redemption price was approximately 817 million on december 26 2017 we purchased approximately 300 million  aggregate principal amount of the 800 million outstanding principal amount of the 7125 senior notes due 2020 the 2020 notes at a total purchase price of approximately 331 million as a result of the early redemption of the 2018 notes and the purchase of the 2020 notes we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 53 million  in 2017 primarily consisting of 48 million of total premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 notes and 2020 notes 

on november 21 2016 we prepaid the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due 2022 2025 and 2027 the private senior notes and paid the related makewhole amount of approximately 170 million we made the prepayment and makewhole payment using the proceeds from an offering of 125 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes consisting of 500 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2021 and 750 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2026 collectively referred to as the “senior secured notes” we recognized 167 million of the 170 million cash makewhole payment on the private senior notes as a loss on debt extinguishment in 2016 with the 3 million remainder being a debt modification cost that is being amortized over the term of the senior secured notes 

in connection with the completion of the offering of the senior secured notes and the prepayment of the private senior notes in november 2016 certain amendments to the revolving credit agreement became effective the amendments included among other things changes in and additions to the financial and other covenants and a reduction in the size of the facility from 15 billion to 750 million 

in 2016 in conjunction with our debt restructuring including amendments to the revolving credit agreement in july and november 2016 we recognized 18 million of debt issuance and amendment fees 

see further discussion below under “liquidity and capital resources” for additional information 

capacity expansion projects 

our capacity expansion projects were completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 capacity expansion project expenses of 73 million  are included in other operating — net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2016 and generally consisted of administrative costs and other project costs that did not qualify for capitalization

financial executive summary 

we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 290 million  in 2018  compared to 358 million  in 2017  or a decrease in net earnings between the periods of 68 million  as 2017 included the benefit of tax reform diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders was 124  in 2018  compared to 153  in 2017  or a decrease of 029  per share 

our income tax provision  for 2018  was 119 million  compared to an income tax benefit  of 575 million  in 2017  a change of 694 million  primarily driven by the impact of tax reform which was recognized in 2017 we recognized a 491 million tax benefit in 2017 related to the enactment of tax reform in the united states which added 210 to diluted earnings per share further information regarding the impact of tax reform can be found above under “items affecting comparability of results—tax cuts and jobs act” the remaining increase in our income tax provision of 203 million was due primarily to pretax income in 2018 compared to a pretax loss in 2017 

our total gross margin increased by 483 million  or 111  in 2018  to 917 million  as compared to 434 million  in 2017  the increase in gross margin was due primarily to 



cf industries holdings inc 

net interest expense declined by 75 million  to 228 million  in 2018  compared to 303 million  in 2017  the decline is due to our redemption in december 2017 of all of the 2018 notes and our december 2017 purchase of approximately 300 million  aggregate principal amount of the 800 million outstanding principal amount of the 2020 notes as a result we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 53 million  in 2017 primarily consisting of 48 million of total premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 notes and 2020 notes

year ended december 31 2018  compared to year ended december 31 2017   

net sales 

our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

our total net sales increased   299 million  or 7  to 443 billion  in 2018  compared to 413 billion  in 2017  due to an 11   increase  in average selling prices which increased net sales by 520 million partially offset by a 3   decrease  in sales volume which decrease d net sales by 221 million 

average selling prices were 229  per ton in 2018  compared to 207  per ton in 2017  as selling prices increased across all segments during 2018 higher energy costs in asia and europe along with continued enforcement of environmental regulations in china resulted in lower nitrogen production tightening supply and demand conditions in addition outages at several producers also impacted the nitrogen supply and demand balance these factors collectively drove global nitrogen prices higher in 2018 

the decrease  in total sales volume of 3  was due primarily to lower sales volume in our ammonia and an segments partially offset by higher sales volumes in our granular urea and other segments 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

our cost of sales decreased   184 million  or 5  in 2018  from 2017  the decrease in our cost of sales was due primarily to a 3 decrease in sales volume an unrealized net marktomarket gain on natural gas derivatives in 2018  compared to a loss in 2017  and the impact of lower realized natural gas costs these decreases were partially offset by higher costs related to plant turnaround and maintenance activity and other plant outages in 2018 the cost of sales per ton averaged 182  in 2018  a 2  decrease from 185  per ton in 2017  cost of sales includes a 13 million  unrealized net marktomarket gain in 2018  compared to a 61 million  unrealized net marktomarket loss in 2017  additionally realized natural gas costs including the impact of realized derivatives decreased 7  to 316  per mmbtu in 2018  from 340  per mmbtu in 2017  

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees including those for corporate initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses increase d 23 million  to 214 million  in 2018  from 191 million  in 2017  the increase  was due primarily to higher employee costs including higher incentive compensation as a result of improved operating results costs associated with certain corporate initiatives and costs for various legal services associated with the acquisition of the publicly traded common units of tnclp 

other operating—net 

other operating—net includes administrative costs that do not relate directly to our central operations and in 2016 costs associated with our capacity expansion projects costs included in “other operating costs” can include foreign exchange gains and losses unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives costs associated with our closed facilities amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets 

other operating—net was 27 million  of income in 2018  compared to 18 million  of expense in 2017  the income in 2018  was primarily due to the combination of changes in legal reserves insurance proceeds of 10 million  and a gain of 6 million  from the recovery of certain precious metals used in the manufacturing process

equity in earnings of operating affiliates 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates primarily consists of our 50  ownership interest in plnl we include our share of the net earnings from our equity method investment in plnl as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates was 36 million  in 2018  compared to 9 million  in 2017  the increase in earnings was due primarily to improved operating results for plnl primarily driven by higher ammonia selling prices in addition earnings in 2018 include approximately 19 million  related to the net aftertax impact of a settlement reached between ngc and plnl of an arbitration proceeding regarding plnl’s claims for damages due to historical natural gas supply curtailments see above under “items affecting comparability of results—equity method investments” for additional information earnings in 2017  includes a gain of 14 million  related to the sale of our interest in a joint venture that owned a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility 

interest expense—net 

our interest expense—net includes the interest expense on our longterm debt amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements and annual fees pursuant to our revolving credit agreement capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the facility along with all other construction costs interest expense—net also includes interest income which represents amounts earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments 

net interest expense decreased by 75 million  to 228 million  in 2018  from 303 million  in 2017  the 75 million   decrease  was primarily due to our redemption in december 2017 of all of the 800 million outstanding principal amount of the 2018 notes and our december 2017 purchase of approximately 300 million aggregate principal amount of the 800 million outstanding principal amount of the 2020 notes 

loss on debt extinguishment 

loss on debt extinguishment of 53 million  in 2017  primarily consists of premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 notes and 2020 notes 

income tax provision benefit 

our income tax provision  for 2018  was 119 million  on pretax income  of 547 million  compared to an income tax benefit  of 575 million  on a pretax loss  of 125 million  in 2017  our effective tax rate for 2018  is based on the us federal tax rate of 21 as a result of the enactment of the tax act on december 22 2017 as compared to the us federal tax rate of 35 that was applicable in 2017  our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in cfn and prior to april 2 2018 tnclp as our consolidated income tax provision benefit does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests our effective tax rate for 2018  of 217  exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of 138 million  would be 291 

our effective tax rate for 2018  was impacted by a 16 million  increase to the provisional amount recorded in 2017 for the transition tax liability as result of the enactment of the tax act 

the tax act also provided a new tax category global intangible lowtaxed income gilti for income from foreign operations that is subject to federal income tax beginning in our 2018 tax year the tax effect for our gilti reduced the deferred tax asset for the 2017 net operating loss carryover by 12 million 

on april 2 2018 we acquired the tnclp public units our effective tax rate in 2018  is impacted by a 16 million reduction to our deferred tax liability due to the change in our effective state income tax rate resulting from the implementation of legal entity structure changes related to the acquisition 

in 2017 due primarily to the 491 million income tax benefit from the tax act we recognized a 575 million income tax benefit on a pretax loss of 125 million our effective tax rate in 2017  exclusive of the tax benefit from the tax act and exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of 92 million  from our pretax loss results in an effective tax rate of 388 see note 17—noncontrolling interests  for additional information 

both 2018  and 2017  were impacted by additional discrete tax items see note 10—income taxes  for additional information 

cf industries holdings inc 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests includes the net earnings attributable to the approximately 11 chs minority equity interest in cfn a subsidiary of cf holdings prior to april 2 2018 net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests also included the net earnings attributable to the 247  interest of the publicly held common units of tnclp beginning in the second quarter of 2018 as a result of the april 2 2018 acquisition of the tnclp public units there are no longer earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in tnclp 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased   46 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  due primarily to higher earnings from cfn driven by higher average selling prices due to the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance partially offset by the reduction in noncontrolling interests due to the april 2 2018 purchase of the noncontrolling interests in tnclp 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decrease d 029  to 124  per share in 2018  from 153  per share in 2017  this decrease  is due primarily to the impact of tax reform in 2017  partially offset in 2018  by higher gross margin primarily driven by higher selling prices due to the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance the impact of higher unrealized net marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives and lower realized natural gas costs 

year ended december 31 2017  compared to year ended december 31 2016   

net sales 

our total net sales increased   445 million  or 12  to 413 billion  in 2017  compared to 369 billion  in 2016  due to an 18  increase in sales volume which increased net sales by 738 million partially offset by a 5 decrease in average selling prices which reduced net sales by 293 million 

average selling prices were 207 per ton in 2017  compared to 217 per ton in 2016  due primarily to lower ammonia uan and granular urea average selling prices in 2017 selling prices were negatively impacted by greater supply availability which continued to pressure selling prices globally during the fourth quarter of 2017 certain announced nitrogen industry capacity additions that were expected to occur were delayed and certain maintenance outages all led to a favorable supply demand balance and contributed to a rise in nitrogen pricing 

the increase in total sales volume of 18  was due primarily to higher ammonia and granular urea sales volumes driven by increased production from the completion of our capacity expansion projects in december 2016 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales increased 854 million  or 30  from 2016  to 2017  the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume higher unrealized net marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives and higher realized natural gas costs including the impact of realized derivatives in addition to higher depreciation expense related to the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing those assets into service these increases to cost of sales were partially offset by targeted cost reduction initiatives production efficiencies due to increased volume in 2017  and the absence of startup costs of the new ammonia plant at our donaldsonville facility and the new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal facility that occurred in 2016  the cost of sales per ton averaged 185  in 2017  a 10  increase from 168  per ton in 2016  cost of sales included a 61 million  unrealized net marktomarket loss in 2017  compared to a 260 million  unrealized net marktomarket gain in 2016  additionally realized natural gas costs including the impact of realized derivatives increased 11 from 307 per mmbtu in 2016  to 340 per mmbtu in 2017  

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 18 million  to 191 million  in 2017  from 173 million  in 2016  the increase was due primarily to the combination of certain corporate office initiatives and higher incentive compensation due to improvements in operating performance 

transaction costs 

transaction costs consist of various consulting and legal services associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of oci that was terminated on may 22 2016 and our strategic venture with chs which began on february 1 2016 

cf industries holdings inc 

in 2016  we incurred 179 million of transaction costs including the 150 million termination fee paid to oci in the second quarter of 2016  as a result of the termination of the combination agreement and costs for various consulting and legal services 

other operating—net 

other operating—net was 18 million  of expense in 2017  compared to 208 million  of expense in 2016  the decreased expense was due primarily to a 93 million loss in 2016  from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily british pound and canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested due to a restructuring of certain intercompany loans we did not incur the same level of foreign exchange rate impacts in 2017 the decreased expense was also due to expansion project expenses in 2016  of 73 million generally consisting of administrative and other project costs that did not qualify for capitalization and a 23 million charge representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with chs see note 9—fair value measurements  for additional information 

equity in earnings losses of operating affiliates 

equity in earnings losses of operating affiliates was 9 million  of earnings in 2017  compared to 145 million  of losses in 2016  earnings in 2017  included a gain of 14 million related to the sale of our interest in a joint venture that owned a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility in the fourth quarter of 2016  we recognized a 134 million impairment of our equity method investment in plnl for additional information regarding the impairment of our equity method investment in plnl see “critical accounting policies and estimates” below and note 8—equity method investments  

interest expense—net 

net interest expense increased by 108 million  to 303 million  in 2017  from 195 million  in 2016  the 108 million   increase  was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of our capacity expansion projects in 2016  capitalized interest was 166 million  compared to 2 million  in 2017  net interest expense in 2016  also included the amortization of capitalized bridge credit agreement fees of 28 million pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain businesses of oci upon the termination of the proposed combination with oci the unamortized portion of these fees was expensed 

during 2016  due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future we modified the revolving credit agreement by reducing its size from 20 billion to 750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms as a result of these changes we recognized 16 million of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense in 2016  

loss on debt extinguishment 

loss on debt extinguishment of 53 million  in 2017  primarily consisted of premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 notes and 2020 notes loss on debt extinguishment of 167 million  in 2016  consisted of the makewhole payment which resulted from our november 21 2016 prepayment of the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of private senior notes the loss on debt extinguishment of 167 million  excluded 3 million of the 170 million makewhole payment which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees a reduction of longterm debt and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the senior secured notes 

income tax benefit provision 

our income tax benefit for 2017  was 575 million  on a pretax loss of 125 million  compared to an income tax benefit of 68 million  on a pretax loss of 226 million  in the prior year the higher income tax benefit in 2017  was due primarily to the impact of the tax act which resulted in an income tax benefit of 491 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017  reflecting our best estimate of the impact of the tax act 

the primary impact of the tax act is the revaluation of all of our us deferred tax balances as result of the reduction of the us statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 which resulted in an income tax benefit of 552 million that was recorded in 2017 this income tax benefit was partially offset by a tax charge and liability of 57 million which represented our best estimate of the transition tax or repatriation tax on foreign earnings and profits as described above under “items affecting comparability—tax cuts and jobs act” 

cf industries holdings inc 

in addition in both years our effective tax rate was impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in cfn and tnclp as our consolidated income tax benefit provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests as a result earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of 92 million  and 119 million  in 2017 and 2016 respectively which are included in our pretax loss impact the effective tax rate in both years see note 17—noncontrolling interests  for additional information 

due primarily to the 491 million income tax benefit from the tax act we recognized a 575 million  income tax benefit in 2017  on a pretax loss of 125 million  our effective tax rate in 2017  exclusive of the tax benefit from the tax act and exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of 92 million  from our pretax loss resulted in an effective tax rate of 388 our effective tax rate in 2016  exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of 119 million  from our pretax income resulted in an effective tax rate of 196 

in the fourth quarter of 2016  we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in plnl of 134 million  which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates our 2016  income tax provision does not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it will not give rise to a tax deduction which reduced our 2016  effective tax rate 

both 2017  and 2016  were impacted by additional discrete tax items see note 10—income taxes  for additional information 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests includes the net earnings attributable to the 247  interest of the publiclyheld common units of tnclp prior to our acquisition of the tnclp public units on april 2 2018 we owned approximately 753  of tnclp and outside investors owned the remaining 247  net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests also includes the net earnings attributable to the approximately 11 chs minority equity interest in cfn a subsidiary of cf holdings 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased   27 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  due primarily to lower earnings from both cfn and tnclp as both were impacted by lower average selling prices due to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions the earnings of cfn were also impacted by higher natural gas prices and the impact of higher depreciation as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing those assets into service 

diluted net earnings loss per share attributable to common stockholders 

diluted net earnings loss per share attributable to common stockholders including the impact of tax reform increased   272  to earnings of 153  per share in 2017  from a loss of 119  per share in 2016  this increase  was due primarily to the impact of tax reform partially offset by lower gross margin primarily driven by an increase in unrealized net marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives the impact of lower selling prices due to greater global nitrogen supply availability higher realized natural gas costs including the impact of realized derivatives and higher depreciation expense

government policies 

the policies or laws of governments around the world can result in the imposition of taxes duties tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world the policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers or farmers due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic political and social objectives additionally the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity the impact of changes in governmental policies or laws or the political or social objectives of a country could have a material impact on fertilizer demand and selling prices and therefore could impact our liquidity 

ethanol industry and the renewable fuel standard 

corn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 37 of total us corn demand us government policy as expressed in the renewable fuel standard rfs is a major determinant for the ethanol market the rfs establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels including ethanol that must be included in the united states’ supply of fuel for transportation in addition the us congress at various times has proposed legislation to either modify or eliminate the rfs while past legislation proposing changes to the rfs has not been enacted into law there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be enacted into law other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol gasoline and corn lower gasoline prices may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry which could impact the demand for corn and nitrogen fertilizer and therefore could impact our liquidity 

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

we have operations in canada the united kingdom and an interest in a joint venture in the republic of trinidad and tobago historically the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us were recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings were recognized unless the earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested based upon our then current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurred at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings could occur in different periods 

in light of changes made by the tax act commencing with the 2018 tax year the united states no longer taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries even when such earnings are earned or repatriated to the united states unless such earnings are subject to us rules on passive income or certain antiabuse provisions foreign subsidiary earnings may still be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated to the united states 

cash balances held by our joint venture are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint venture on a periodic basis 

as of december 31 2018  approximately 33 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 682 million  was held primarily by our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries historically the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represented accumulated earnings of our foreign operations that were not considered to be permanently reinvested as of december 31 2018  as a result of the amounts accrued in the transition tax liability recorded in 2017 and 2018 as a result of the tax act we would not expect any additional cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian and united kingdom

forward sales and customer advances 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose therefore our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contract’s value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time control transfers to the customer thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until control transfers and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had 149 million  and 89 million  respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets 

while customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers’ outlook of future market fundamentals during periods of declining prices customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the current prices if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase additionally borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity 

under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customer’s inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs for example natural gas costs including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 40  of our total production costs in 2018  as a result natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity 

because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america have declined since 2008 but are subject to volatility during 2018  the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 248  per mmbtu on four consecutive days in february 2018 and a high of 688  per mmbtu on january 4 2018  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2018  the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 149  per mmbtu on three consecutive days in march 2016 and a high of 688  per mmbtu on january 4 2018  

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2018  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 660  per mmbtu on two consecutive days in january 2018 and a high of 3174  per mmbtu on march 2 2018  during the threeyear period ended december 31 

cf industries holdings inc 

2018  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 280  per mmbtu on september 1 september 12 and september 14 2016 and a high of 3174  per mmbtu on march 2 2018  

natural gas costs in our cost of sales including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives decreased 7  per mmbtu in 2018  from 2017  

derivative financial instruments 

we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers from time to time we may also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives in 2018  2017  and 2016  we recognized unrealized net marktomarket gains losses on natural gas derivatives of 13 million  61 million  and 260 million  respectively which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 

derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks other major financial institutions or large energy companies and in most cases the use of international swaps and derivatives association isda master netting arrangements the isda agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for overthecounter derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk in part by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement 

the isda agreements for most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support thresholds in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position the revolving credit agreement at any time when it is secured provides a cross collateral feature for those of our derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to or affiliates of parties to the revolving credit agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives in the event the revolving credit agreement becomes unsecured separate collateral could be required in connection with such derivatives 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was zero  and 12 million  respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates as of december 31 2018  we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 66 million mmbtus of natural gas basis swaps as of december 31 2017  we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 359 million  mmbtus that included natural gas fixed price swaps and basis swaps at both december 31 2018  and 2017  we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts the credit support documents executed in connection with certain of our isda agreements generally provide us and our counterparties the right to set off collateral against amounts owing under the isda agreements upon the occurrence of a default or a specified termination event 

embedded derivative liability 

under the terms of our strategic venture with chs if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels we are required to make a nonrefundable yearly payment of 5 million to chs since our credit ratings were below certain levels in 2016 2017 and 2018 we made a payment of 5 million to chs in each year these payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or february 1 2026

cash flows 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities  in 2018  was 1497 million  as compared to 1631 million  in 2017  a decline  of 134 million  the decline  was primarily due to our receipt in 2017 of an 815 million income tax refund as a result of the claim to carry back the 2016 federal tax loss to prior income tax years the remaining change in net cash from operating activities is an increase in cash from operations in 2018 of 681 million as compared to 2017 this increase was due primarily to an increase in operating earnings of the business lower usage of working capital in 2018 in the areas of accounts receivable and accounts payable and accruals and lower pension contributions in 2018 in 2018 we contributed 39 million to our pension plans compared to 82 million in 2017 

net cash provided by operating activities  in 2017  was 1631 million  as compared to 617 million  in 2016  an increase of 1014 million  the increase was primarily due to working capital changes including the receipt of our 815 million income tax refund related to the claim to carry back the 2016 federal tax loss to prior income tax years the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was also a result of entering 2017 with a lower level of customer advances than 2016 due to customer reluctance to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment these increases were partially offset by higher contributions to our pension plans in 2017 we contributed 82 million to our pension plans compared to 23 million in 2016 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities  was 375 million  in 2018  compared to 413 million  in 2017  during 2018  capital expenditures totaled 422 million  compared to 473 million  in 2017  net cash used in investing activities in 2018  included 10 million  related to property insurance proceeds received net cash used in investing activities of 220 billion  in 2016  included 221 billion  in capital expenditures primarily related to our capacity expansion projects that were completed as of december 31 2016

net cash used in financing activities was 127 billion  in 2018  compared to 156 billion  in 2017  and compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 244 billion  in 2016  

net cash used in financing activities in 2018  included 388 million  related to our acquisition of all of the outstanding publicly traded common units of tnclp in addition we repurchased 109 million  of our common shares for 500 million  of which 33 million  was accrued and unpaid as of december 31 2018  in 2018  2017  and 2016  we distributed 139 million  131 million  and 119 million  respectively to the noncontrolling interests in cfn and tnclp

contractual obligations 

the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  



 



cf industries holdings inc 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of our products the rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one  to eleven years  and the barge charter commitments range from two  to seven years  we also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system some of which contain minimum throughput requirements the storage agreements contain minimum terms generally ranging from one  to five years  and commonly contain provisions for automatic annual renewal thereafter unless canceled by either party see note 24—leases  for additional information 

we do not have any other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap us gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

income taxes 

we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period in which these changes occur 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

historically a deferred income tax liability was recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and joint venture that were considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income tax liability was recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and joint venture which we believed to be permanently reinvested in light of changes made by the tax act the company continues to evaluate whether it will continue to treat foreign subsidiary earnings as being permanently reinvested 

as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation in the countries in which we operate changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and foreign joint venture that could be subjected to us taxation it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods 

we operate in a number of countries and as a result have a significant amount of cross border transactions the taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators in countries across the globe including the countries in which we operate the tax rules and regulations within the various countries in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various countries as a result there are instances 

cf industries holdings inc 

where regulators within the countries involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances we work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions however there are instances where reaching a common understanding is not possible or practical as of december 31 2018  we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits including penalties and interest of 155 million  which is related predominantly to certain potential tax exposures involving cross border transactions this amount represents our best estimate of the potential amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions differences in interpretation of the tax laws including agreements between governments surrounding our cross border transactions can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimates 

recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating rates operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review 

the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value and the reduction in value is other than temporary the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earnings 

plnl is our joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied under the ngc contract by ngc the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method the joint venture experienced past curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which reduced the ammonia production at plnl the ngc contract had an initial expiration date of september 2018 and was extended on the same terms until september 2023 any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will be based on new agreements 

as part of our impairment assessment of our equity method investment in plnl we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a 134 million  impairment charge in 2016 related to our equity method investment in plnl the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2018  is 93 million  if ngc does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to plnl at prices that permit profitable operations plnl may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in plnl 

the uk government held a referendum on the uk’s membership in the european union in june 2016 which resulted in the electorate voting in favor of the uk exit from the european union brexit a process of negotiation is now taking place to determine the future terms of the united kingdom’s relationship with the european union with the united kingdom due to exit the european union on march 29 2019 we operate two nitrogen manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom which utilize foreignsourced materials and equipment and which also export products in addition to serving customers in the united kingdom brexit including its indirect effects could impact us in the future for example the cost and availability of natural gas or other raw materials or equipment that we purchase and the demand or selling prices for the nitrogen products that we sell could be impacted by changes in tariffs duties trade restrictions or other factors brexit could lead to changes in trade flows trading relationships the movement of production to alternative locations or the curtailment of certain production at certain sites brexit could also impact foreign exchange rates or uk interest rates which could impact our operations or the valuation of our assets and liabilities since the uk referendum in june 2016 the united kingdom has experienced increases in the volatility of foreign exchange rates which impacted our operations as a result of the uncertainty of brexit including its indirect effects changes in the future profitability asset utilization or business valuation of our uk operations could negatively impact us and may result in an impairment of our longlived assets or goodwill as of december 31 2018 longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets and goodwill related to the united kingdom were 742 million and 264 million respectively 

cf industries holdings inc 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further analysis is necessary however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test which involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill impairment would be recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2018  2017  or 2016  reviews as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the carrying value of our goodwill was 235 billion  and 237 billion  respectively 

intangible assets identified in connection with our 2010 acquisition of terra industries inc consist of customer relationships which are being amortized over a period of 18 years the intangible assets identified in connection with our 2015 acquisition of cf fertilisers uk  consist of customer relationships and trade names which are being amortized over a period of approximately 20  years our intangible assets are presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets see note 7—goodwill and other intangible assets  for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized key assumptions that affect our projected benefit obligation pbo are discount rates and in addition for our united kingdom plans an adjusted retail price index rpi key assumptions affecting pension expense include discount rates the expected longterm rate of return on assets eroa and in addition for our united kingdom plans rpi 

 the december 31 2018  pbo was computed based on a weightedaverage discount rate of 41  for our north america plans and 29  for our united kingdom plans which were based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo the weightedaverage discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2018  was 36  for north america plans and 25  for united kingdom plans our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 45  weightedaverage eroa used to calculate pension expense in 2018  for our north america plans is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods the 42  weightedaverage eroa used to calculate pension expense in 2018  for our united kingdom plans is based on expected longterm performance of underlying investments the eroa for both north america and united kingdom plans are adjusted for expenses and diversification bonuses the 33  rpi used to calculate our united kingdom plan pbo and the 32  rpi used to calculate 2018  pension expense is developed using the bank of england implied retail price inflation curve which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and indexlinked government bonds 

 for north america qualified pension plans our pbo was 742 million  as of december 31 2018  which was 69 million  higher than pension plan assets for our united kingdom pension plans our pbo was 524 million  as of december 31 2018  which was 141 million  higher than pension plan assets the tables below estimate the impact of a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the key assumptions on our december 31 2018  pbo and 2018  pension expense

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to nitrogenbased fertilizers are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea uan 32 and an by approximately 33 22 16 and 16 respectively 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily with the use of derivative financial instruments the derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps natural gas basis swaps and natural gas options these derivatives settle using primarily a nymex futures price index which represents the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods as of december 31 2018  we had natural gas basis swaps covering certain periods through march 2019 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had open derivative contracts for 66 million  mmbtus and 359 million  mmbtus respectively a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas at december 31 2018  would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of 7 million  and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by 7 million  

from time to time we may purchase nitrogen products on the open market to augment or replace production at our facilities 

interest rates 

as of december 31 2018  we had seven series of senior notes totaling 475 billion  of principal outstanding with maturity dates of may 1 2020  december 1 2021  june 1 2023 december 1 2026  march 15 2034  june 1 2043 and march 15 2044 the senior notes have fixed interest rates as of december 31 2018  the carrying value and fair value of our senior notes was approximately 470 billion  and 427 billion  respectively 

borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear current market rates of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings there were no  borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2018  or december 31 2017  or during 2018 or 2017 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we are directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro we generally do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

we operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries were canceled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock 

in april 2010 we acquired terra industries inc terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities our approximately 753 interest in tnclp and certain joint venture interests 

in march 2014 we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was located in florida to mosaic for approximately 14 billion in cash 

cf industries holdings inc 

in july 2015 we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk  not previously owned by us for total consideration of 570 million  and cf fertilisers uk  became wholly owned by us 

in february 2016 our strategic venture with chs commenced at which time chs purchased a minority equity interest in cfn for 28 billion  

in 2016 we completed capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa which increased our production capacity by 25 for a total capital cost of 52 billion 

on february 7 2018 we announced that tngp elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4612562 publicly traded common units of tnclp on april 2 2018 for a cash purchase price of 84033 per unit in accordance with the terms of tnclp’s partnership agreement the purchase price of all of the 4612562 publicly traded common units of tnclp is approximately 390 million upon completion of the purchase we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of tnclp 

product tons and nutrient tons 

unless otherwise stated we measure our production and sales volume in this annual report on form 10k in product tons which represents the weight of the product measured in short tons one short ton is equal to 2000 pounds references to uan product tons assume a 32 nitrogen content basis for production volume 

we also provide certain supplementary volume information measured in nutrient tons nutrient tons represent the weight of the product’s nitrogen content which varies by product ammonia represents 82 nitrogen content granular urea represents 46 nitrogen content uan represents between 28 and 32 nitrogen content and an represents between 29 and 35 nitrogen content 

reportable segments 

our reportable segments consist of the following segments ammonia granular urea uan an and other these segments are differentiated by products we use gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources total other operating costs and expenses consisting of selling general and administrative expenses and other operating—net and nonoperating expenses interest and income taxes are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management see note 20—segment disclosures  for additional information 

our products   

our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia granular urea uan and an our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the following table net sales do not reflect amounts used internally such as ammonia in the manufacture of other products 



 

 gross margin was 430 million  840 million  and 1547 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

we own and operate seven nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in north america including five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in the united states one in medicine hat alberta canada and one in courtright ontario canada as of december 31 2017  the combined production capacity of these seven facilities represented approximately 42 43 44 

cf industries holdings inc 

and 19 of north american ammonia granular urea uan and an production capacity respectively each of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in north america has onsite storage to provide flexibility to manage the flow of outbound shipments without impacting production 

we also operate two united kingdom nitrogen manufacturing complexes located in ince and billingham that produce ammonia an and npks and serve primarily the british agricultural and industrial markets 

the following table shows the production capacities as of december 31 2017  at each of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities

point lisas trinidad 

the point lisas nitrogen facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago is owned jointly through a 5050 venture with koch fertilizer llc this facility has the capacity to produce 720000 tons of ammonia annually from natural gas supplied under a contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago ngc 

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in 2017  natural gas accounted for approximately 47  of our total production costs for nitrogen fertilizer products our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities have access to abundant competitivelypriced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities our facilities utilize the following natural gas hubs henry hub in louisiana sonat in louisiana tetco ela in louisiana oneok in oklahoma aeco in alberta ventura in iowa demarcation in kansas welcome in minnesota dawn in ontario parkway in ontario and the national balancing point nbp in the united kingdom 

in 2017 our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consumed in the aggregate approximately 356 million mmbtus of natural gas in 2017 the amount of natural gas consumed by our nitrogen manufacturing facilities increased as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects we employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced supply of natural gas we also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices see note 14—derivative financial instruments  for additional information about our natural gas hedging activities 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the safe efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer products to terminals warehouses and customers each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location 

our north american nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the us and canada with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5000 tank and hopper cars as well as railcars provided by rail carriers our united kingdom nitrogen production facilities mainly ship products via truck 

the north american waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our donaldsonville verdigris and yazoo city facilities to ship ammonia and uan we employ a fleet of ten tow boats and thirtytwo river barges which are primarily leased we also utilize contract marine services to move urea fertilizer we can also export nitrogen fertilizer products via seagoing vessels from our donaldsonville yazoo city billingham and ince manufacturing facilities 

three of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia the donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2000mile long nustar pipeline through which we have the ability to transport ammonia to more than 20 terminals and shipping points in the midwestern us corn belt our verdigris and port neal facilities are connected to the 1100mile long magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the midwestern united states 

cf industries holdings inc 

storage facilities and other properties 

as of december 31 2017  we owned or leased space at 62  inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 22state region of the united states canada and the united kingdom including storage at our production facilities we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately 35 million  tons of fertilizer our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table 



 

 customers 

the principal customers for our nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products are cooperatives independent fertilizer distributors farmers and industrial users chs was our largest customer in 2017  and accounted for approximately 11  of our consolidated net sales sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force 

competition 

our markets are global and intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

our primary north americanbased competitors include nutrien ltd formed in january 2018 by the merger of agrium inc and potash corporation of saskatchewan inc koch fertilizer llc and iowa fertilizer company additionally yara basf is expected to bring a new north american nitrogen fertilizer production facility on line in 2018 there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition from foreignsourced products continuously 

our primary united kingdom competition comes from imported products supplied by companies including yara international origin fertilisers ameropa chs and helm urea and uan are not produced in the united kingdom but along with an are widelytraded fertilizer products with limited barriers to entry 

seasonality 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

financial information about foreign and domestic sales and operations 

the amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying value of our foreign and domestic longlived assets are set forth in note 20—segment disclosures

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act tsca and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment we may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future 

environmental health and safety expenditures 

our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2017  totaled approximately 21 million we estimate that we will have approximately 60 million of capital expenditures for environmental health and safety in 2018  environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cerclaremediation matters 

from time to time we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws in 2011 we received a notice from the idaho department of environmental quality ideq that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho the current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site we and the current owner are currently conducting a remedial investigationfeasibility study of the site in 2015 we and several other parties received a notice that the us department of interior and other trustees intend to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for a group of former phosphate mines in southeast idaho including the former georgetown canyon mine see note 19—contingencies  for additional information on the cerclaremediation matters 

regulation of greenhouse gases 

we are subject to regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states concerning greenhouse gas ghg emissions 

the united kingdom is a party to the kyoto protocol as a result of agreements reached during a conference in durban south africa in 2011 the kyoto protocol will continue in force for a second commitment period which will expire by 2020 on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15°c above preindustrial levels the paris agreement which has been accepted by the united states and ratified by canada and the united kingdom went into effect in november 2016 the paris agreement could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate   

the united kingdom has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas trading system our uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require these plants to purchase co 2  emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our uk sites are also subject to the european union emissions trading scheme 

canada withdrew from further participation in the kyoto protocol in december 2011 but is a party to the paris agreement in canada we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with 

cf industries holdings inc 

environment canadas national pollutant release inventory and ontarios mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation in addition the canadian national government in collaboration with canadian provinces has developed a pancanadian framework on clean growth and climate change among other things the framework establishes a nationwide price on carbon emissions which price serves as a floor for the ghg emissions reduction requirements of the separate canadian provinces and territories the announced plan would impose a 10 per ton canadian dollars charge beginning in 2018 rising to 50 per ton by 2022 the framework provides for a review of the approach taken by the national government and the provinces to address further action after 2022 

ontario is party to the western climate initiative wci comprising california and several canadian provinces on january 1 2017 ontario launched its own ghg cap and trade program under this program the ontario government will set a hard limit on emissions which will steadily decline annually by 2020 the cap will mandate that ghg emissions decline by 15 compared to 1990 levels facilities that generate more than 25000 tonnes of ghg emissions per year will be required to participate in the cap and trade program and will require emissions allowances for every tonne of ghg emitted during the 20172020 compliance period we are eligible to receive free emissions allowances although the amount of free allowances will decline through 2020 this will require us to purchase emission allowances or to reduce ghg emissions ontario has stated it intends to reassess the extent to which it will provide free allowances for post2020 compliance periods beginning january 1 2018 ontarios cap and trade program is linked with the cap and trade programs of quebec and california 

 in alberta the specified gas emitters regulation ghg regulation was implemented in 2007 this program required facilities emitting more than 100000 tons of ghgs per year to reduce emissions by 12 over such facilities 2007 levels to meet this requirement companies could reduce emissions purchaseuse offset credits or contribute to a technology fund at an annual rate of 15 per ton of co 2  beginning in 2018 our facility will become subject to the carbon competitiveness incentive regulation which establishes productspecific benchmarks based on the most efficient ghg emitting facilities in a sector similar to the existing regulation a facility that exceeds the applicable benchmark will be required to take action to reduce its ghg emissions intensity purchase emissions offsets or performance credits or make contributions to albertas climate fund the obligations under this regulation are being phased in over a three year period and will be tightened over time 

the united states is not a party to the kyoto protocol but is a party to the paris agreement however in june 2017 the united states announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement subject to renegotiation of the paris agreement on terms more favorable to the united states under the terms of the paris agreement the united states cannot formally provide notice of its withdrawal before november 2019 which would become effective one year after providing such notice in the interim it is unclear if the united states will comply with its commitments under the paris agreement there has been no indication to date that the united states announced withdrawal is causing other countries to also consider withdrawing from the paris agreement in the united states ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels although some of the more significant developments to date including epas clean power plan do not directly impose obligations on our facilities the epa has issued a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and report the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result are required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd construction permit applicable to such facilities we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to ghgs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects other than the states implementation of this permitting requirement none of the states where our us production facilities are located—iowa louisiana mississippi and oklahoma—has proposed control regulations limiting ghg emissions 

new source performance standards for nitric acid plants 

we operate 14 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides no x  notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas 

cf industries holdings inc 

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals more stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits on december 15 2016 the epa redesignated the greater baton rouge nonattainment area brna where our donaldsonville facility is located to attainment with the 2008 8hour ozone standard however on october 26 2015 the epa published a more stringent national ambient air quality standard for ozone the state of louisiana has recommended to the epa that baton rouge be designated as nonattainment with the 2015 ozone standard on december 20 2017 the epa notified the state of louisiana that it intends to designate the baton rouge area as nonattainment for the 2015 ozone standard on january 5 2018 the epa published notice of a public comment period with respect to the proposed attainmentnonattainment designations of certain air quality regions including the baton rouge area such a classification in the baton rouge area or in other areas where our manufacturing facilities are located could result in more stringent air pollution emissions limits for our existing operations and would also subject our facilities to more stringent requirements to obtain approvals for plant expansions or could make it difficult to obtain such approvals 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we employed approximately 2900 fulltime and 100 parttime employees

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand for nitrogen is affected by planted acreage crop selection and fertilizer application rates driven by population growth or changes in dietary habits and nonfood use of crops such as production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things demand also includes industrial uses of nitrogen for example chemicals manufacturing and emissions reductants such as diesel exhaust fluid def supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade 

periods of strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to stimulate global investment in production capacity the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply availability and affect the balance of supply and demand in recent years fertilizer producers including cf holdings have built new production facilities or expanded capacity of existing production assets or announced plans to do so global nitrogen fertilizer capacity has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating a surplus of global nitrogen fertilizer capacity leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices 

selling prices reached multiyear lows in 2017  the average selling price for our products in 2017  was 207  per ton compared to 217  per ton in 2016  a decline of 5  and 314 per ton in 2015 a decline of 31 

additional production capacity is expected to come on line over the next twelve months we cannot predict the extent to which the current oversupply environment global or local economic and financial conditions or changes in such conditions or other factors may cause delays cancellation or acceleration of other announced andor ongoing projects we also cannot predict the closures or operating rates of existing installed capacity 

price fluctuations for our products result from changes in supply demand balances the significant price fluctuations we have experienced are also a symptom of an oversupplied market in transition as new capacity ramps up and trade flows adjust imports into different regions of the world impact the local supply demand balances if imports increase into an oversupplied region lower prices in that region could result 

we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line 

during periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production our financial performance credit ratings and the trading price for our common stock have been negatively impacted by the lower selling prices resulting from the current global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer the period of time that these conditions will persist and the degree to which they will impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows is uncertain 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality 

we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities consolidation in the industry may increase the resources of several of our competitors for example in january 2018 our competitors agrium inc and potash corporation of saskatchewan inc completed their merger into the newly formed company nutrien ltd some of our competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals our competitive position could suffer to the

extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships 

china the world’s largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers currently has significant capacity surplus and many highcost plants as a result the domestic nitrogen industry in china is operating at less than full capacity if chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi or decreases in chinese producers’ underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage increased production capacity utilization any resulting export volume could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our competitors in russia continue to benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas allowing continued exports from the region and have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity the 2016 revocations of us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia allow for increases in imports from that country 

we also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe and latin america who depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the demand for our products 

conditions in the united states europe and other global agricultural areas significantly impact our operating results agricultural planted areas and production can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding production of or trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control 

governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing “food versus fuel” debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand 

developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate or nitrogenefficient varieties could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products widespread adoption of emerging application technologies could disrupt traditional application practices affecting the volume or types of products used and timing of applications in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including any limitation on the use and application of chemical fertilizer could affect the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is dependent on natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea urea ammonium nitrate solution uan ammonium nitrate an and other nitrogen products 

because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2017  the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 244  per mmbtu on february 28 2017  and a high of 365  per mmbtu on three consecutive days in january 2017 during the threeyear period ended december 31 2017  the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 149  per mmbtu on three consecutive days in march 2016 and a high of 377  per mmbtu on december 8 2016  

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national

balancing point during 2017  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 330  per mmbtu on june 15 2017  and a high of 900  per mmbtu on december 12 2017  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2017  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 280  per mmbtu on september 1 september 12 and september 14 2016 and a high of 900  per mmbtu on december 12 2017  

changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas additionally increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production or increased demand were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states or elsewhere natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations and those of our joint venture are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and any delay or interruption in the delivery of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we and our joint venture use natural gas and other raw materials in the manufacture of nitrogen products we purchase the natural gas and other raw materials from third party suppliers our natural gas is transported by pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint venture by third party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties delays or interruptions in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials may be caused by among other things severe weather or natural disasters unscheduled downtime labor difficulties insolvency of our suppliers or their inability to meet existing contractual arrangements deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents or mechanical failures our joint venture point lisas nitrogen limited has experienced numerous natural gas curtailments as discussed in the risk factor below titled we are exposed to risks associated with our joint venture in addition the transport of natural gas by pipeline is subject to additional risks including delays or interruptions caused by capacity constraints leaks or ruptures any delay or interruption in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials even for a limited period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers and are subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight this exposes us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to additional liability 

we rely on railroad truck pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and operating hazards additionally due to the aging infrastructure of certain bridges roadways rail lines river locks and equipment that our third party service providers utilize we may experience delays in both the receipt of raw materials or the shipment of finished product while repairs maintenance or replacement activities are conducted also certain third party service providers particularly railroads have experienced periodic service slowdowns due to capacity constraints in their systems operational and maintenance difficulties and other events which impact the shipping times of our products 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents discharges or other releases of hazardous substances terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives governmental entities could implement new or more stringent regulatory requirements affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products 

if shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies’ failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in

in the united states and canada the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads’ potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads shift liability to shippers by contract purport to shift liability to shippers by tariff or otherwise seek to require shippers to indemnify and defend the railroads from and against liabilities including in negligence strict liability or statutory liability that may arise from certain acts or omissions of the railroads third parties with insufficient resources unknown causes or acts of god these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads or third parties for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new or more stringent regulatory requirements also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products restrictions on service increases in transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors and any railroad industry initiatives that may impact our ability to transport our products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacture transportation storage and distribution of chemical products including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled plant downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage there can be no assurance that we will be able to buy and maintain insurance with adequate limits and reasonable pricing terms and conditions 

in april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities have been named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases have been consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption “in re west explosion cases” the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325 individuals and 80 insurance companies plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident the court granted in part and denied in part the cf entities’ motions for summary judgment in august 2015 over one hundred sixty cases have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements that have been or we expect will be fully funded by insurance the remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pretrial proceedings the next trial is expected to be scheduled for later in 2018 we believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the cf entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits the increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilities

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow prevent us from fulfilling our obligations and impair our ability to pursue or achieve other business objectives 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 469 billion  of total funded indebtedness consisting primarily of secured and unsecured senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2020 and 2044 or approximately 41  of our total capitalization and an additional 695 million  of senior secured borrowing availability reflecting no outstanding borrowings and 55 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our senior secured revolving credit agreement as amended the revolving credit agreement our substantial debt service obligations will have an impact on our earnings and cash flow for so long as the indebtedness is outstanding 

our substantial indebtedness could through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it could 

 we expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our revolving credit agreement and the terms of our outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

our revolving credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions include covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries other than certain excluded subsidiaries to among other things 

  in addition our revolving credit agreement requires us to comply with consolidated interest coverage ratio total debt to capital ratio and consolidated secured leverage ratio maintenance covenants 

cf industries holdings inc 

certain of these restrictions could be suspended if and for so long as we satisfy certain investment grade corporate rating and consolidated leverage tests however we cannot assure you that we will meet these tests or if we do that we will be able to maintain compliance with those conditions 

as a result of these restrictions and covenants under our existing indebtedness including our senior secured notes we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include additional or more restrictive covenants we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants under the terms of our indebtedness or if we fail to do so that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend such covenants 

we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 

the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur additional debt in the future including additional secured and unsecured indebtedness the indentures governing our senior secured notes do not limit incurrence by us of additional unsecured indebtedness and will permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness subject to certain restrictions although our revolving credit agreement contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness these restrictions are subject to exceptions and qualifications which allow us to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness in limited amounts if we incur additional indebtedness the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could intensify if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate our relations with our creditors including the holders of our outstanding debt securities the lenders under our revolving credit agreement and our suppliers may be materially and adversely affected 

a breach of the covenants under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under such agreements 

our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness will depend upon our future performance and various other factors such as market prices for our nitrogen products natural gas prices and other business competitive and regulatory factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to maintain compliance with all of these covenants in that event we would need to seek an amendment to our debt agreements or would need to refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we can obtain future amendments or waivers of our debt agreements and instruments or refinance our debt and even if we were able to do so such relief might only last for a limited period potentially necessitating additional amendments waivers or refinancings any noncompliance by us with the covenants under our debt agreements and instruments could result in an event of default under those debt agreements and instruments an event of default under an agreement or instrument governing any of our indebtedness may allow our creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if our lenders or holders of our debt securities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we may be forced to liquidate certain assets to repay all or part of our indebtedness which could materially and adversely impair our business operations an event of default under our revolving credit agreement would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under our revolving credit agreement furthermore our revolving credit agreement and senior secured notes provide for liens on specified collateral to secure our obligations thereunder and if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under our revolving credit agreement or the senior secured notes our revolving credit agreement lenders or holders of the senior secured notes as applicable could proceed against the collateral granted to them which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness we cannot assure that we would have sufficient assets to make such repayment 

potential future downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on us

cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results 

we rely on information technology and computer control systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications the management of our accounting financial and supply chain functions and plant operations business and supply chain disruptions plant and utility outages and information technology system and network disruptions due to cyber attacks could seriously harm our operations and materially adversely affect our operating results cyber security risks include attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers damage or loss of information due to viruses the unintended disclosure of confidential information the misuse or loss of control over computer control systems and breaches due to employee error our exposure to cyber security risks includes exposure through third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we routinely review and implement security procedures and measures in order to protect our systems and information from being vulnerable to evolving cyber attacks we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate prevent or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks compromises to our information and control systems could have severe financial and other business implications 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations 

weather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting growing harvesting or application periods may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following application period resulting in lower seasonal demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions during or following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freezeoffs or hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise 

tax matters including changes in tax laws or rates adverse determinations by taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in the united states where most of our operations are located and numerous foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized tax rates in various jurisdictions in which we operate may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in our mix of earnings from countries with differing statutory tax rates and tax systems changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the irs and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the united states although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have used the cash we generate outside the united states primarily to fund development of our business in nonus jurisdictions if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the united states we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the united states under the tax laws of the foreign countries in which we operate those international earnings would be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated therefore the repatriation of those earnings could result in an increase in our worldwide effective tax rate and an increase in our use of cash to pay these taxes 

we also need to comply with other new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs or value added taxes or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 the tax act or tax reform the tax act significantly changes how the us taxes corporations the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act and significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from the interpretation currently reflected in our financial statements or tax returns as we continue our analysis of the tax act we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such adjustments are made 

in addition foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities 

our nitrogen fertilizer operations are located at nine separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represented approximately 40  of our ammonia production capacity as of december 31 2017  the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane or high wind activity and several of our complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to affect adversely the shipping and distribution of our products moreover our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace and could result in operational disruptions 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws regulations and permitting requirements as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes 

as a producer of nitrogen fertilizer products working with hazardous substances our business faces risks of spills discharges or other releases of those substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current facilities or facilities previously owned by us or other acquired businesses adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental health and safety laws change regularly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental health and safety laws and regulations we may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion or modification of our operations is predicated upon securing necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval or a determination that we have violated a law or permit as a result of a governmental inspection of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at our facilities and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows on october 26 2015 the epa published a final regulation lowering the national ambient air quality standard for ozone ozone attainment designations were due by october 1 2017 in november 2017 the epa issued a partial list of air quality regions that are in attainment with the 2015 ozone standard but it has not yet promulgated the final list of air quality regions that will be classified as as being in nonattainment with the ozone standard these regions will be subject to more stringent permitting requirements which in turn could make it much more difficult and expensive to obtain permits to construct new facilities or expand our existing operations 

future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states in the united states our existing facilities currently are only subject to ghg emissions reporting obligations although our new and modified facilities are likely to be subject to ghg emissions standards included in their air permits our facilities in the united kingdom are subject to regulatory emissions trading systems which generally require us to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset ghg emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program our facility in alberta canada has been subject to a provincial regulation requiring reductions in the facility’s net emissions intensity which can be met by facility improvements the purchase of emissions offsets or performance credits or contributions to a nonprofit climate change fund established by alberta beginning in 2018 our facility became subject to the carbon competitiveness incentive regulation this regulation establishes productspecific benchmarks based on the most efficient ghg emitting facilities in a sector similar to the existing regulation a facility that exceeds the applicable benchmark is required to take action to reduce its ghg emissions intensity purchase emissions offsets or performance credits or make contributions to albertas climate fund the obligations under this regulation are being phased in over a threeyear period and will be tightened over time 

  our courtright ontario facility is subject to ontario’s ghg capandtrade program that began in january 2017 in addition the canadian national government in collaboration with canadian provinces has developed the pancanadian framework on clean growth and climate change among other things the framework establishes a nationwide price on carbon emissions which price serves as a floor for the ghg emissions reduction requirements of the separate canadian provinces and territories the announced plan would impose a 10 per ton canadian dollars charge beginning in 2018 rising to 50 per ton by 2022 the framework provides for review of the approach taken by the national government and the provinces to address future action after 2022 

there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement which has been accepted by the united states and ratified by canada and the united kingdom went into effect in november 2016 however in june 2017 the united states announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement subject to renegotiation of the paris agreement on terms more favorable to the united states under the terms of the paris agreement the united states cannot formally provide notice of its withdrawal before november 2019 which would become effective one year after providing such notice in the interim it is unclear if the united states will comply with its commitments under the paris agreement there has been no indication to date that the united states announced withdrawal is causing other countries to also consider withdrawing from the paris agreement if the paris agreement remains in effect it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

more stringent ghg regulations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states canada or the united kingdom our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us

our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season 

if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from us 

a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assets 

any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months 

we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives and the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses 

we often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased products we have used futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts 

our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidity 

we have also used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts to hedge our exposure to natural gas price volatility hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies 

cf industries holdings inc 

our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments or by the trigger of any cross default provisions or credit support requirements additionally the international swaps and derivative association master netting arrangements for most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position 

we are subject to risk associated with our strategic venture with chs inc 

we may not realize the full benefits from our strategic venture with chs that are expected the realization of the expected benefits of the chs strategic venture depends on our ability to operate and manage the strategic venture successfully and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with chs over the life of the agreement among other factors additionally any challenges related to the chs strategic venture could harm our relationships with chs or our other customers 

we are exposed to risks associated with our joint venture 

we have a 50 ownership interest in plnl which owns and operates an ammonia production facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago our joint venture partner shares a measure of control over the operations of our plnl joint venture as a result our investment in our plnl joint venture involves risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our plnl joint venture or our partner have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to or have veto rights over our instructions requests policies or objectives subject our plnl joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business 

in addition we may become involved in disputes with our plnl joint venture partner which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

plnls ammonia plant relies on natural gas supplied under a gas sales contract the ngc contract by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which have reduced the ammonia production at plnl the ngc contract had an initial expiration date of september 2018 and has been extended on the same terms until september 2023 any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price plnl and ngc are currently parties to arbitration proceedings where the main issue remaining in dispute is plnls claims for damages from curtailments although the joint venture believes its claims against ngc to be meritorious it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration there are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture beyond 2023 that are uncertain at this time including the quantities of gas ngc will make available the cost of such gas the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing 

as part of our impairment assessment of our equity method investment in plnl we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a 134 million  impairment charge in 2016  previously in 2015  we recognized an impairment charge of 62 million related to our equity method investment in plnl the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2017  is 108 million  failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc after 2023 on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture and could result in further impairment to the value of the joint venture such as ceasing operations and writing off the remaining investment in plnl which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives we are subject to various security laws and regulations in the united states these security laws include the maritime transportation security act of 2002 and the chemical facilities antiterrorism standards regulation in addition president obama issued in 2013 executive 

cf industries holdings inc 

order 13650 improving chemical facility safety and security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen products that can be used as explosives it is possible that governmental entities in the united states or elsewhere could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen products thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for us 

in october 2016 the department of homeland security dhs released its new chemical security assessment tool csat 20 surveys and enhanced risk tiering methodology facilities that had previously submitted a survey response to the dhs were notified to resubmit responses to online questionnaires to be evaluated through the revised and enhanced risk tiering methodology in april 2017 the dhs began sending tiering determination letters to chemical facilities based on the new methodology depending on the risk classification resulting from the application of csat 20 our plants and terminals could be subject to more stringent stringent requirements related to chemical security 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations 

our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions 

our principal reporting currency is the us dollar and our business operations and investments outside the united states increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change including for example in response to sudden global economic conditions resulting from measures like the referendum in the united kingdom in june 2016 which resulted in a vote in favor of exiting the european union brexit we may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by among other things requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in or indexed to the us dollar or a currency freely convertible into us dollars or hedging through foreign currency derivatives these efforts however may not be effective and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs in various jurisdictions including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 the canadian corruption of foreign public officials act and economic sanctions programs administered by the united nations the european union and the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury and regulations set forth under the comprehensive iran accountability divestment act as a result of doing business internationally we are exposed to a risk of violating anticorruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we our partners or agents operate violations of anticorruption and sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and termination of existing contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment the violation of applicable laws by our employees consultants agents or partners could subject us to penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation administration and enforcement will change over time changes in antitrust laws globally or in their interpretation administration or enforcement may limit our existing or future operations and growth 

deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers’ reluctance to replenish inventories changes in global economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such changes can be difficult to ascertain resulting in anxiety among market participants that can persist for protracted periods for example concern and 

cf industries holdings inc 

uncertainty over the potential impact of brexit on the global economy has resulted in increased volatility in global financial markets the overall impact of changes in global economic conditions on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted 

in addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen products significantly influence our operating results the international market for nitrogen products is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen products into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate that affect foreign trade and investment

industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply and demand factors 

our products are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition the customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality the selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions changes in supply and demand and different cost factors 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth gross domestic product growth changes in dietary habits planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand growth may depend on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption governmental regulations including fertilizer subsidies or requirements mandating increased use of biofuels or industrial nitrogen products and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key exportingconsuming countries such as china india russia and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of nitrogenbased fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for these commodities 

over the last decade strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity as a result global nitrogen fertilizer capacity increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating a surplus of global nitrogen capacity in the market and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in addition global feedstock commodity prices declined including coal and oillinked gas contributing to the lower nitrogen fertilizer prices 

cf industries holdings inc 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental trade policies the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last decade has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america including our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa which were completed in december 2016 changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east ukraine the republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa russia and china have been major exporters to north america 

farmers economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns crop prices and the types of crops planted

items affecting comparability of results 

tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act or tax reform which includes a number of changes to us tax law that affect us as a result of the tax act we recognized a 491 million  income tax benefit which has a significant impact on our 2017 financial results this impact generally results from the following two major provisions 

 nitrogen fertilizer selling prices 

a significant amount of new nitrogen production capacity came on line in 2016 and 2017 including an increase in production capacity located in north america which has further increased supply additional production capacity is expected to come on line in 2018 as a result we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line 

the us gulf is a major global fertilizer pricing point due to the volume of nitrogen fertilizer that trades there through most of 2016 nitrogen pricing at the us gulf declined often trading below parity with other international pricing points due to continued imports from various exporting regions and delayed north american buyer interest as a result of greater global nitrogen supply availability seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multiyear lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of 2016 early in the first quarter of 2017 prices began to increase as the supply and demand balance tightened in anticipation of spring fertilizer demand for the planting and growing season however as the first quarter progressed increased imports into north america increased fertilizer supply in the region which pressured selling prices downward as the quarter ended during the second quarter of 2017 excess supply through imports into the united states that occurred in the first quarter of 2017 continued in the second quarter negatively impacting selling prices during the third quarter of 2017 prices hit yearly lows and then selling prices for most nitrogen products increased throughout the quarter ending higher than at the beginning of the quarter driven by significantly lower chinese exports higher energy and production costs in parts of the world a weaker us dollar and strong global demand during the fourth quarter of 2017 certain announced nitrogen industry capacity additions that were expected to occur were delayed and certain maintenance outages all led to a favorable supply demand balance and contributed to a rise in nitrogen pricing 

the significant price fluctuations we have experienced in 2017 are symptoms of a market in transition as new capacity comes on line and global trade flows adjust and this transition is not complete we expect the final set of north american capacity additions to come fully on line by mid2018 should imports of nitrogen products into north america continue at high rates the oversupply in the region will continue which could lead to lower prices similar to those experienced in early 2017 new global nitrogen capacity additions coming on line after 2018 are expected to be lower than recent years which will support the market transition or more balanced supply and demand 

the greater global nitrogen supply availability and resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices significantly impacted our results the average selling price for our products for 2017  2016  and 2015  was 207  per ton 217  per ton and 314  per ton respectively the decline in average selling prices from 2016 to 2017 reduced net sales by 293 million while the decline in average selling prices from 2015 to 2016 reduced net sales by 14 billion in addition to the direct impact of lower selling prices during periods of declining prices customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation of prices in the future being lower than current prices 

cf industries holdings inc 

during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  certain significant items impacted our financial results the following table and related discussion outline these significant items and how they impacted the comparability of our financial results during these periods positive amounts in the table below are costs or expenses incurred while negative amounts are income recognized in the periods presented

cf industries holdings inc 

depreciation and amortization 

total depreciation and amortization expense recognized in 2017  2016  and 2015  was 883 million  678 million  and 480 million  respectively this increase in depreciation expense reflects the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing in service all five of the new plants prior to the end of 2016 the capacity expansion projects were originally announced in 2012 and included the construction of new ammonia urea and uan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex these plants increased our overall production capacity by approximately 25 improved our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville and improved our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location the following table indicates the quarter in which each of the five expansion plants were placed in service 



depreciation expense pertaining to each of our capacity expansion plants commenced once the applicable plant was placed in service 

unrealized net marktomarket loss gain on natural gas derivatives 

natural gas is typically the largest and most volatile single component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased products we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivatives that we use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting this can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations in 2017  2016  and 2015  we recognized unrealized net marktomarket losses gains on natural gas derivatives of 61 million  260 million  and 176 million  respectively 

loss gain on foreign currency transactions including intercompany loans 

in 2017  2016  and 2015  we recognized losses gains of 2 million  93 million  and 8 million  respectively from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily british pound and canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested 

equity method investment tax contingency accrual

loss earnings before income taxes 

earnings before income taxes increased by 101 million  to a loss of 125 million  in 2017 from a loss of 226 million  in 2016 the increase in earnings before income taxes is due to a combination of the following three categories of items which are described below 

 significant charges in 2016 

in 2016 we recognized 617 million of certain significant charges from the following items 

 gross margin from operations in 2017 

as discussed earlier in overview of cf holdings—industry factors and items affecting comparability of results our operating results continue to be impacted by a surplus of capacity in the nitrogen industry which has impacted product selling prices industry pricing conditions in 2017 declined early in the year to multiyear lows as oversupply conditions persisted but selling prices rose as the year ended when supply and demand conditions were more in balance due to delays in the startup of certain new industry capacity and stronger demand in certain regions our results in 2017 also included the full impact of all of our new capacity expansion plants as a result we set both production and sales volume records in 2017 

our gross margin declined by 410 million  in 2017  to 430 million  from 840 million  in 2016  the following major factors contributed to the decline in gross margin 



cf industries holdings inc 

 interest expense — net 

net interest expense increased by 108 million  to 303 million  in 2017 from 195 million  in 2016 the increase is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of our capacity expansion projects in 2016 

cash position 

our cash and cash equivalents balance was 835 million  at december 31 2017 a decline of 329 million from 116 billion  at december 31 2016 during 2017 our cash balance was significantly impacted by the following events which are further described in liquidity and capital resources below

the following table presents our consolidated results of operations and supplemental data 

 

nm—not meaningful 



cf industries holdings inc 

year ended december 31 2017  compared to year ended december 31 2016   

net sales 

our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

our total net sales increased   445 million  or 12  to 413 billion  in 2017  compared to 369 billion  in 2016  due to an 18   increase  in sales volume which increase d net sales by 738 million partially offset by a 5   decrease  in average selling prices which reduced net sales by 293 million 

average selling prices were 207  per ton in 2017  compared to 217  per ton in 2016  due primarily to lower ammonia uan and granular urea average selling prices in 2017  selling prices were negatively impacted by greater supply availability which continues to pressure selling prices globally during the fourth quarter of 2017 certain announced nitrogen industry capacity additions that were expected to occur were delayed and certain maintenance outages all led to a favorable supply demand balance and contributed to a rise in nitrogen pricing 

the increase  in total sales volume of 18  was due primarily to higher ammonia and granular urea sales volumes driven by increased production from the completion of our capacity expansion projects in december 2016 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

our cost of sales increased   855 million  or 30  from 2016  to 2017  the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume higher unrealized net marktomarket loss es on natural gas derivatives and higher realized natural gas costs including the impact of realized derivatives in addition to higher depreciation expense related to the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing those assets into service these increases to cost of sales were partially offset by targeted cost reduction initiatives production efficiencies due to increased volume in 2017 and the absence of startup costs of the new ammonia plant at our donaldsonville facility and the new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal facility that occurred in 2016 the cost of sales per ton averaged 185  in 2017  a 10  increase from 168  per ton in 2016  cost of sales includes a 61 million  unrealized net marktomarket loss in 2017  compared to a 260 million  unrealized net marktomarket gain in 2016  additionally realized natural gas costs including the impact of realized derivatives increased 11  from 307  per mmbtu in 2016 to 340  in 2017 

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees including those for corporate initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses increase d 18 million  to 192 million  in 2017  from 174 million  in 2016  the increase  was due primarily to the combination of certain corporate office initiatives and higher incentive compensation due to improvements in operating performance 

transaction costs 

transaction costs consist of various consulting and legal services associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of oci that was terminated on may 22 2016 our strategic venture with chs which began on february 1 2016 and our july 31 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us 

in 2016  we incurred 179 million  of transaction costs including the 150 million  termination fee paid to oci in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the termination of the combination agreement and costs for various consulting and legal services 

cf industries holdings inc 

other operating—net

other operating—net was 18 million  of expense in 2017  compared to 208 million  of expense in 2016  the decreased expense was due primarily to a 93 million  loss in 2016  from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily british pound and canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested due to a restructuring of certain intercompany loans we did not incur the same level of foreign exchange rate impacts in 2017  the decreased expense is also due to expansion project expenses in 2016  of 73 million  generally consisting of administrative and other project costs that did not qualify for capitalization and a 23 million  charge representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with chs see note 8—fair value measurements  for additional information 

equity in earnings losses of operating affiliates 

equity in earnings losses of operating affiliates primarily consists of our 50  ownership interest in plnl we include our share of the net earnings from our equity method investment in plnl as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition in 2016 equity in earnings losses of operating affiliates also includes impairment of our equity method investment in plnl 

equity in earnings losses of operating affiliates was 9 million  of earnings in 2017  compared to 145 million  of losses in 2016  earnings in 2017  includes a gain of 14 million  related to the sale of our interest in a joint venture that owns a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility in the fourth quarter of 2016  we recognized a 134 million  impairment of our equity method investment in plnl for additional information regarding the impairment of our equity method investment in plnl see critical accounting policies and estimates below and note 7—equity method investments  

interest expense—net 

our interest expense—net includes the interest expense on our longterm debt amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements and annual fees pursuant to our revolving credit agreement capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the facility along with all other construction costs our interest expense—net also includes interest income which represents amounts earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments 

net interest expense increased by 108 million  to 303 million  in 2017  from 195 million  in 2015 the 108 million   increase  was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of our capacity expansion projects in 2016  capitalized interest was 166 million  compared to 2 million  in 2017  net interest expense in 2016  also includes the amortization of capitalized bridge credit agreement fees of 28 million pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain businesses of oci upon the termination of the proposed combination with oci the unamortized portion of these fees was expensed 

during 2016  due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future we modified the revolving credit agreement by reducing its size from 20 billion to 750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms as a result of these changes we recognized 16 million  of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense in 2016  

loss on debt extinguishment 

loss on debt extinguishment of 53 million  in 2017 primarily consists of premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 notes and 2020 notes loss on debt extinguishment of 167 million  in 2016 consists of the makewhole payment which resulted from our november 21 2016 prepayment of the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of private senior notes the loss on debt extinguishment of 167 million  excludes 3 million of the 170 million makewhole payment which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees a reduction of longterm debt and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the senior secured notes 

cf industries holdings inc 

income tax benefit provision 

our income tax benefit for 2017  was 575 million  on a pretax loss of 125 million  compared to an income tax benefit of 68 million  on a pretax loss of 226 million  in the prior year the higher income tax benefit in 2017  is due primarily to the impact of the tax act which resulted in an income tax benefit of 491 million  recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017  reflecting our best estimate of the impact of the tax act 

the primary impact of the tax act is the revaluation of all of our us deferred tax balances as result of the reduction of the us statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 which resulted in an income tax benefit of 552 million that was recorded in 2017 this income tax benefit was partially offset by a tax charge and liability of 57 million which represents our best estimate of the transition tax or repatriation tax on foreign earnings and profits as described above under items affecting comparability—tax cuts and jobs act 

in addition in both years our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in cfn and tnclp as our consolidated income tax benefit provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests as a result earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of 92 million  and 119 million  in 2017 and 2016 respectively which are included in our pretax loss impact the effective tax rate in both years see note 16—noncontrolling interests  for additional information 

due primarily to the 491 million  income tax benefit from the tax act we recognized a 575 million  income tax benefit in 2017 on a pretax loss of 125 million our effective tax rate in 2017 exclusive of the tax benefit from the tax act and exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of 92 million from our pretax loss results in an effective tax rate of 388 our effective tax rate in 2016 exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of 119 million from our pretax income resulted in an effective tax rate of 196 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in plnl of 134 million  which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates our 2016 income tax provision does not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it will not give rise to a tax deduction which reduced our 2016 effective tax rate 

both 2017 and 2016 were impacted by additional discrete tax items see note 9—income taxes  for additional information 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests includes the net earnings attributable to the 247  interest of the publiclyheld common units of tnclp we own approximately 753  of tnclp and outside investors own the remaining 247  net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests also includes the net earnings attributable to the approximately 11 chs minority equity interest in cfn a subsidiary of cf holdings purchased for 28 billion  on february 1 2016 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased   27 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  due primarily to lower earnings from both cfn and tnclp as both were impacted by lower average selling prices due to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions the earnings of cfn were also impacted by higher natural gas prices and the impact of higher depreciation as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing those assets into service 

diluted net earnings loss per share attributable to common stockholders 

diluted net earnings loss per share attributable to common stockholders including the impact of tax reform increase d 272  to earnings of 153  per share in 2017  from a loss of 119  per share in 2016  this increase  is due primarily to the impact of tax reform partially offset by lower gross margin primarily driven by an increase in unrealized net marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives the impact of lower selling prices due to greater global nitrogen supply availability higher realized natural gas costs including the impact of realized derivatives and higher depreciation expense 

year ended december 31 2016  compared to year ended december 31 2015   

net sales 

our total net sales decreased   623 million  or 14  to 369 billion  in 2016  compared to 431 billion  in 2015  the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition increased our net sales by 269 million or 6 the remaining decline in our net sales of 892 million or 21 was due to a 31 decline in average selling prices partially offset by a 14 increase in sales volume 

cf industries holdings inc 

average selling prices excluding the cf fertilisers uk acquisition impact were 218 per ton in 2016  compared to 318 per ton in 2015  due primarily to lower selling prices across all products selling prices were negatively impacted by excess global nitrogen supply pricing for nitrogen fertilizer products in the us gulf declined during most of 2016 often trading below parity with other international pricing points as a result of continued imports from various exporting regions and decreased buyer interest seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multiyear lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of the year 

our total sales volume increased by 24 from 2015  to 2016  the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition increased our sales volume by 10 the remaining increase in our sales volume of 14 was due primarily to greater granular urea and uan volume available for sale due to our completed capacity expansion projects partly offset by lower ammonia sales volume due to lower demand in north america during the fall application season in addition our ammonia sales volumes were lower in 2016 as we upgraded existing ammonia production as a result of our granular urea and uan capacity expansion projects coming on line at our donaldsonville louisiana complex 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales increased 84 million  or 3  from 2015  to 2016  the overall increase in cost of sales is due primarily to the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition which increased cost of sales by 251 million or 9 as 2016  includes a full year of cf fertilisers uk results and 2015 includes five months of cf fertilisers uk results the remaining decrease in our cost of sales of 167 million or 6 was due primarily to the combination of unrealized net marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives and lower realized natural gas costs partly offset by higher capacity expansion project related costs cost of sales includes a 260 million  unrealized net marktomarket gain in 2016  as compared to a 176 million  unrealized net marktomarket loss in 2015  realized natural gas costs including the impact of lower purchased natural gas costs and realized derivatives declined 6  from 328  per mmbtu in 2015  to 307  per mmbtu in 2016  as natural gas prices were lower in 2016  particularly in the first half of the year with high storage levels and strong production in north america although natural gas prices increased towards the end of 2016  

capacity expansion project costs including depreciation expense which commenced once the respective expansion plant was placed in service totaled 116 million in 2016 startup costs which primarily relate to the cost of commencing production at the new ammonia plants for our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa plants totaled 52 million in 2016  

cost of goods sold per ton declined 33 per ton or 16 from 201 in 2015  to 168 in 2016  as a result of the factors noted above 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 4 million  to 174 million  in 2016  from 170 million  in 2015  the increase was due primarily to the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition partly offset by lower costs for corporate office initiatives and lower intangible asset amortization expense 

transaction costs 

in 2016  we incurred 179 million  of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of oci and our strategic venture with chs this includes the 150 million termination fee paid by cf holdings to oci in the second quarter of 2016  as a result of the termination of the combination agreement and costs for various consulting and legal services in 2015  we incurred 57 million  of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of oci our strategic venture with chs and the acquisition of the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us 

other operating—net 

other operating—net was 208 million  in 2016  compared to 92 million  in 2015  the increased expense was due primarily to 93 million  of realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions primarily related to british pound denominated intercompany debt that has not been permanently invested in addition the increased expense also reflects higher expansion project costs pertaining to our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization and the loss of 23 million  representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with chs see note 8—fair value measurements  for additional information these increases were partly offset by a decrease in realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency derivatives of 22 million  

cf industries holdings inc 

equity in losses earnings of operating affiliates 

equity in losses earnings of operating affiliates decreased by 110 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  due primarily to a 134 million impairment of our equity method investment in plnl that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016  in the fourth quarter of 2015  we recognized a 62 million impairment of our equity method investment in plnl the remaining decrease was due primarily to lower operating results from plnl which included costs of 21 million that were incurred during 2016  related to a planned maintenance activity at the plnl ammonia plant that resulted in the shutdown of the plant for approximately 45 days and the impact of lower ammonia selling prices in 2016  compared to 2015  for additional information regarding the impairment of our equity method investment in plnl see critical accounting policies and estimates below and note 7—equity method investments  

interest expense—net 

net interest expense increased by 64 million  to 195 million  in 2016  from 131 million  in 2015  the 64 million  increase in net interest expense was due primarily to the combination of higher debt levels due to the issuance of 10 billion of private senior notes in september 2015 and debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs due to the restructuring of our debt and the revolving credit agreement in 2016  due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future we modified the revolving credit agreement in 2016 by reducing its size from 20 billion to 750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms as a result of these changes we recognized 16 million  of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense the increase in interest expense—net in 2016  also includes the amortization of capitalized bridge credit agreement fees of 28 million pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain of the oci businesses we also recorded capitalized interest of 166 million  in 2016  related primarily to our capacity expansion projects compared to 154 million  in 2015  

loss on debt extinguishment 

loss on debt extinguishment of 167 million  in 2016 consists of the makewhole payment which resulted from our november 21 2016 prepayment of the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of private senior notes this amount excludes 3 million of the 170 million makewhole payment which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees a reduction of longterm debt and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the senior secured notes 

income tax benefit provision 

our income tax benefit for 2016  was 68 million on a pretax loss of 226 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 300 compared to an income tax provision of 396 million on pretax income of 106 billion or an effective tax rate of 374 in the prior year 

state income taxes for 2016  were favorably impacted by investment tax credits of 13 million related to capital assets placed in service at our production facilities in oklahoma that are indefinitely available to offset income taxes in that jurisdiction in future years our effective state income tax rate was also reduced as a result of the changes to our legal entity structure effected in the first quarter of 2016 as part of our strategic venture with chs see note 16—noncontrolling interests  for additional information 

state income taxes for 2016  includes a tax benefit of 46 million net of federal tax effect for state net operating loss carryforwards 

the income tax provision for 2016  includes the tax impact of the recaptured us manufacturing profits deductions claimed in prior years that will not be deductible as a result of our intention to carryback the tax net operating loss for the year ended december 31 2016 to those prior tax years 

nondeductible capital costs for the tax year ended december 31 2016 include certain transaction costs capitalized in the prior year that are now deductible as a result of the termination of the proposed combination with certain businesses of oci 

foreign subsidiaries of the company have incurred capital losses of 109 million that are indefinitely available to offset capital gains in those foreign jurisdictions as the future realization of these carryforwards is not anticipated a valuation allowance of 28 million was recorded in 2016  

in the fourth quarters of 2016  and 2015  we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in plnl of 134 million  and 62 million  

cf industries holdings inc 

respectively which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates our respective income tax provisions do not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it will not give rise to a tax deduction 

during the third quarter of 2015  we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us and recognized a 94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk the earnings in cf fertilisers uk have been permanently reinvested therefore the recognition of the 94 million million gain on the remeasurement of the historical equity investment does not include the recognition of tax expense on the gain 

in addition our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in cfn and tnclp as our consolidated income tax provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests as a result earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of 119 million  and 34 million  in 2016 and 2015 respectively which are included in loss earnings before income taxes and equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates impact the effective tax rate in both years earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in 2016  due to our strategic venture with chs that commenced on february 1 2016 at which time chs purchased a minority equity interest in cfn see note 16—noncontrolling interests  for additional information 

see note 9—income taxes  for additional information 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the entities that we account for using the equity method and exclude from operating earnings equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates — net of taxes in 2015  included the previously owned 50 equity method earnings of cf fertilisers uk and also included our share of operating losses experienced at keytrade on july 31 2015 we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us for total consideration of 570 million and cf fertilisers uk became wholly owned by us and part of our consolidated financial results we recorded a 94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk in connection with the closing of the acquisition equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates — net of taxes on 2015  also included our share of cf fertilisers uk operating results up to the date of the acquisition in addition during the second quarter of 2015  we sold our interests in keytrade and recorded an aftertax loss of 29 million pretax loss of 40 million 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 85 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  due primarily to the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in cfn this increase is partly offset by lower net earnings attributable to the approximately 247 interest of the publicly held common units of tnclp 

diluted net earnings loss per share attributable to common stockholders 

diluted net loss earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased 415  to a loss of 119  per share in 2016  from diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders of 296  per share in 2015  this decrease is due to lower net earnings

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs working capital capital expenditures debt service investments taxes share repurchases and dividends our working capital requirements are affected by several factors including demand for our products selling prices raw material costs freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business generally our primary source of cash is cash from operations which includes cash generated by customer advances we may also from time to time access the capital markets or engage in borrowings under our credit agreements 

at december 31 2017  we were in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under the revolving credit agreement and our senior notes 

our cash and cash equivalents balance was 835 million  at december 31 2017  a decline of 329 million from 116 billion  at december 31 2016 during 2017 our cash balance was significantly impacted by the following events which are further described below 

 capacity expansion project and receipt of tax refund from tax loss carryback 

in 2016 we completed capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa that were originally announced in 2012 these projects provided us with an increase of approximately 25 in production capacity and had a total capital cost of 52 billion the completion of our capacity expansion projects has reduced what had been a substantial use of liquidity in recent years see discussion under overview of cf holdings—items affecting comparability of results—depreciation and amortization above and —capital spending below for further information on these projects 

a significant portion of the capital assets that were constructed as part of the capacity expansion projects qualified for bonus depreciation under the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 the path act under the provisions of the path act eligible capital additions are subject to 50 bonus depreciation in the year the asset is placed in service we generated a substantial federal net operating loss in 2016 primarily as a result of the bonus depreciation deductions in the second quarter of 2017 we received a federal tax refund of 815 million as a result of the claim to carry back the 2016 federal net operating loss to prior income tax years 

early redemption and purchase of senior notes

capital spending 

we make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base increase our capacity improve plant efficiency and comply with various environmental health and safety requirements capital expenditures totaled 473 million  in 2017  compared to 221 billion  in 2016  with the decrease primarily due to completion in 2016 of our capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa capital expenditures in 2017  include approximately 110 million  of payments to contractors and vendors for work completed on our capacity expansion projects in 2016 

projected capital spending 

capital expenditures for new activity in 2018  are estimated to be in the range of 400 to 450 million planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting unanticipated increases in cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties delay in the receipt of equipment adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties 

purchase of publicly traded common units of tnclp

government policies 

the policies or laws of governments around the world can result in the imposition of taxes duties tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world the policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers or farmers due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic political and social objectives additionally the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity the impact of changes in governmental policies or laws or the political or social objectives of a country could have a material impact on fertilizer demand and selling prices and therefore could impact our liquidity 

ethanol industry and the renewable fuel standard 

corn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 38 of total us corn demand us government policy as expressed in the renewable fuel standard rfs is a major determinant for the ethanol market the rfs establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels including ethanol that must be included in the united states’ supply of fuel for transportation in addition the us congress at various times has proposed legislation to either reduce or eliminate the rfs while past legislation proposing changes to the rfs has not been enacted into law there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be enacted into law other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol gasoline and corn lower gasoline prices may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry which could impact the demand for corn and nitrogen fertilizer and therefore could impact our liquidity

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

we have operations in canada the united kingdom and an interest in a joint venture in the republic of trinidad and tobago historically the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us were recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings were recognized unless the earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested based upon our then current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurred at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings could occur in different periods 

in light of changes made by the tax act commencing with the 2018 tax year the united states no longer taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries even when such earnings are earned or repatriated to the united states unless such earnings are subject to us rules on passive income or certain antiabuse provisions foreign subsidiary earnings may still be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated to the united states 

cash balances held by our joint venture are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint venture on a periodic basis 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 152 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 835 million  was held primarily by our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries historically the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represented accumulated earnings of our foreign operations that were not considered to be permanently reinvested as of december 31 2017  as a result of the amounts accrued in the transition tax liability recorded as a result of the tax act we would not expect any additional cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian and united kingdom cash balances if we were to repatriate this cash in the future

share repurchase programs 

our board of directors the board authorized certain programs to repurchase shares of our common stock each of these programs permitted repurchases to be made from time to time in the open market through privatelynegotiated transactions through block transactions or otherwise our management determined the manner timing and amount of repurchases based on the evaluation of market conditions stock price and other factors on august 6 2014 the board authorized a program to repurchase up to 1 billion  of the common stock of cf holdings through december 31 2016 the 2014 program as of december 31 2016  159 million  shares had been repurchased for an aggregate expenditure of 900 million  the remaining 100 million of share repurchase authorization under the 2014 program expired on december 31 2016 no share repurchase programs were authorized by the board in 2017 

forward sales and customer advances 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose therefore our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had 89 million  and 42 million  respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets 

while customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals during periods of declining prices such as the current environment customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the current prices if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase additionally borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity 

cf industries holdings inc 

under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs for example natural gas costs including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 47  of our total production costs in 2017  as a result natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity 

because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america have declined since 2008 but are subject to volatility during 2017  the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 244  per mmbtu on february 28 2017  and a high of 365  per mmbtu on three consecutive days in january 2017 during the threeyear period ended december 31 2017  the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 149  per mmbtu on three consecutive days in march 2016 and a high of 377  per mmbtu on december 8 2016  

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2017  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 330  per mmbtu on june 15 2017  and a high of 900  per mmbtu on december 12 2017  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2017  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 280  per mmbtu on september 1 september 12 and september 14 2016 and a high of 900  per mmbtu on december 12 2017  

natural gas costs in our cost of sales including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives increased 11  per mmbtu in 2017  from 2016  

derivative financial instruments 

we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers from time to time we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because we use derivative instruments volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives in 2017  2016  and 2015  we recognized unrealized net marktomarket losses gains on natural gas derivatives of 61 million  260 million  and 176 million  respectively which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 

derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks other major financial institutions or large energy companies and in most cases the use of international swaps and derivatives association isda master netting arrangements the isda agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for overthecounter otc derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk in part by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement 

the isda agreements to most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support thresholds in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position the revolving credit agreement at any time when it is secured provides a cross collateral feature for those of our derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to or affiliates of parties to the revolving credit agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives in the event the revolving credit agreement becomes unsecured separate collateral could be required in connection with such derivatives 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 12 million  and zero  respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the credit 

cf industries holdings inc 

riskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 359 million mmbtus and 1830 million  mmbtus respectively at both december 31 2017  and 2016  we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts 

embedded derivative liability 

under the terms of our strategic venture with chs if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels we are required to make a nonrefundable yearly payment of 5 million to chs since our credit ratings were below certain levels in 2016 and 2017 we made a payment of 5 million to chs in each year these payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or february 1 2026 

this obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as an embedded derivative and its value is included in other liabilities see note 16—noncontrolling interests  for additional information 

defined benefit pension plans 

we contributed 82 million  to our pension plans in 2017  the contributions in 2017 include a voluntary contribution of 59 million made in the second quarter of 2017 we expect to contribute approximately 41 million  to our pension plans in 2018  

distributions on noncontrolling interest in cfn 

the cfn board of managers approved semiannual distribution payments during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 in accordance with the second amended and restated limited liability company agreement of cfn as follows

cash flows 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities  in 2017  was 163 billion  as compared to 617 million  in 2016  an increase  of 1014 million  the increase  was primarily due to working capital changes including the receipt of our 815 million income tax refund related to the claim to carry back the 2016 federal tax loss to prior income tax years the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was also a result of entering 2017 with a lower level of customer advances than 2016 due to customer reluctance to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment these increases were partially offset by higher contributions to our pension plans in 2017  we contributed 82 million  to our pension plans compared to 23 million in 2016 

net cash provided by operating activities  in 2016  was 617 million  as compared to 121 billion  in 2015  a decline of 590 million  the decline resulted primarily from lower net earnings during 2016  due to lower selling prices from excess global nitrogen supply partially offset by lower amounts of cash used for working capital purposes lower working capital levels in accounts receivable and inventory plus lower amounts paid for income taxes and certain income tax refunds received in 2016 contributed to the reduction in cash used for working capital favorable changes in working capital also included a greater proportion of sales paid in 2016 as compared to the prior year period as we entered 2016 with a lower level of customer advances than in 2015 due to customers’ hesitancy to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities  was 408 million  in 2017  compared to 218 billion  in 2016  this 177 billion  decrease is due primarily to lower capital expenditures as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa at the end of 2016 during 2017  capital expenditures totaled 473 million  compared to 221 billion  in 2016  the 298 billion  net cash used in investing activities in 2015  included 247 billion  in capital expenditures and the 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us for a net cash payment of 552 million which was net of cash acquired of 18 million 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 156 billion  in 2017  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 244 billion  in 2016  and 77 million  in 2015  in 2017  we paid 115 billion  in connection with the early redemption of 800 million  in aggregate principal amount of our 2018 notes the purchase of approximately 300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 notes pursuant to a tender offer and premiums paid for the early retirement of longterm debt in 2016  chs purchased a minority equity interest in cfn for 28 billion  in 2017  and 2016  we distributed 131 million  and 119 million  respectively to the noncontrolling interests in cfn and tnclp in 2015  we distributed 45 million  to the noncontrolling interest in tnclp the increase in distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to the chs strategic venture which increased the distributions by 79 million  representing the distributions paid to chs in the third quarter of 2016 for the distribution period ended june 30 2016 

 in 2016 we received proceeds of approximately 124 billion  net of discounts from the issuance of the senior secured notes which were used to fund the prepayment of the 10 billion  of private senior notes and the related makewhole payment of 170 million in 2015  we issued the private senior notes and received proceeds of approximately 10 billion no share repurchases were made during 2017  and 2016  compared to cash used for share repurchases in 2015  of 556 million

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of our products the rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one  to eleven years  and the barge charter commitments range from one  to seven years  we also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system some of which contain minimum throughput requirements the storage agreements contain minimum terms generally ranging from one  to five years  and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party see note 23—leases  for additional information 

we do not have any other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap us gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

income taxes 

we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period in which these changes occur 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

historically a deferred income tax liability was recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and joint venture that were considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income tax liability was recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and joint venture which we believed to be permanently reinvested in light of changes made by the tax act the company is evaluating whether it will continue to treat foreign subsidiary earnings as being permanently reinvested 

cf industries holdings inc 

as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation in the countries in which we operate changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and foreign joint venture that could be subjected to us taxation it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods 

we operate in a number of countries and as a result have a significant amount of cross border transactions the taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators in countries across the globe including the countries in which we operate the tax rules and regulations within the various countries in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various countries as a result there are instances where regulators within the countries involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances we work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions however there are instances where reaching a common understanding is not possible or practical as of december 31 2017  we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits including penalties and interest of 151 million  which is related predominantly to certain potential tax exposures involving cross border transactions this amount represents our best estimate of the potential amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions differences in interpretation of the tax laws including agreements between governments surrounding our cross border transactions can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimates 

recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating rates operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review 

the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value and the reduction in value is other than temporary the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earnings 

plnl is our joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the ngc pursuant to the ngc contract the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method the joint venture has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which have reduced the ammonia production at plnl the ngc contract had an initial expiration date of september 2018 and has been extended on the same terms until september 2023 any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price plnl and ngc are currently parties to arbitration proceedings where the main issue remaining in dispute is plnls claims for damages for past and ongoing curtailments 

 although the joint venture believes its claims against ngc to be meritorious it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration there are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture beyond 2023 that are uncertain at this time including the quantities of gas ngc will make available the cost of such gas the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing as part of our 2016 impairment assessment of our equity method investment in plnl we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a 134 million  impairment charge previously in 2015 we recognized an impairment charge of 62 million  related to our equity method investment in plnl the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2017  is 108 million  if ngc does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to plnl at prices that permit profitable operations plnl may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in plnl

we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2017  2016  or 2015  reviews as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the carrying value of our goodwill was 237 billion  and 235 billion  respectively 

intangible assets identified in connection with our 2010 acquisition of terra industries inc consist of customer relationships which are being amortized over a period of 18 years the intangible assets identified in connection with our 2015 acquisition of cf fertilisers uk  consist of customer relationships and trade names which are being amortized over a period of approximately 20  years our intangible assets are presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets see note 6—goodwill and other intangible assets  for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized key assumptions that affect our projected benefit obligation pbo are discount rates and in addition for our united kingdom plans an adjusted retail price index rpi key assumptions affecting pension expense include discount rates the expected longterm rate of return on assets eroa and in addition for our united kingdom plans rpi 

 the december 31 2017  pbo was computed based on a weightedaverage discount rate of 36  for our north america plans and 25  for our united kingdom plans which were based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo the weightedaverage discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2017  was 40  for north america plans and 28  for united kingdom plans our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 42  weightedaverage eroa used to calculate pension expense in 2017  for our north america plans is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods the 46  weightedaverage eroa used to calculate pension expense in 2017  for our united kingdom plans is based on expected longterm performance of underlying investments the eroa for both north america and united kingdom plans are adjusted for expenses and diversification bonuses the 32  rpi used to calculate our united kingdom plan pbo and the 33  rpi used to calculate 2017  pension expense is developed using the bank of england implied retail price inflation curve which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and indexlinked government bonds 

 for north america qualified pension plans our pbo was 805 million  as of december 31 2017  which was 67 million  higher than pension plan assets for our united kingdom pension plans our pbo was 590 million  as of december 31 2017  which was 176 million  higher than pension plan assets the tables below estimate the impact of a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the key assumptions on our december 31 2017  pbo and 2017  pension expense

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to nitrogenbased fertilizers are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea uan 32 and an by approximately 32 22 14 and 15 respectively 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily with the use of derivative financial instruments covering periods through december 2018 the derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options these derivatives settle using primarily nymex futures price indexes which represent the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had open derivative contracts for 359 million  mmbtus and 1830 million  mmbtus respectively a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas at december 31 2017  would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of 33 million  and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by 33 million  

from time to time we may purchase nitrogen products on the open market to augment or replace production at our facilities 

interest rates 

as of december 31 2017  we had seven series of senior notes totaling 475 billion  of principal outstanding with maturity dates of may 1 2020  december 1 2021  june 1 2023 december 1 2026  march 15 2034  june 1 2043 and march 15 2044 the senior notes have fixed interest rates as of december 31 2017  the carrying value and fair value of our senior notes was approximately 469 billion  and 480 billion  respectively 

borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear current market rates of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings there were no  borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2017  or december 31 2016  or during 2017 maximum borrowings under the revolving credit agreement during 2016 were 150 million with a weightedaverage annual interest rate of 185  

upon the termination of the combination agreement on may 22 2016 the lenders’ commitments under the bridge credit agreement terminated automatically there were no borrowings under the bridge credit agreement 

foreign currency exchange rates 

from the fourth quarter of 2012 through 2016 we had entered into eurous dollar derivative hedging transactions related to the eurodenominated construction costs associated with our capacity expansion projects at our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa facilities all of these foreign currency derivatives settled prior to december 31 2016 

we are directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro outside of the transactions described above we generally do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

we operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative 

cf industries holdings inc 

and our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries were canceled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock 

in april 2010 we acquired terra industries inc terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities our approximately 753 interest in tnclp and certain joint venture interests 

in april 2013 we purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in canadian fertilizers limited cfl 

in march 2014 we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was located in florida to mosaic for approximately 14 billion in cash

in 2016 we completed capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa which increased our production capacity by 25 for a total capital cost of 52 billion 

product tons and nutrient tons 

unless otherwise stated we measure our production and sales volume in this annual report on form 10k in product tons which represents the weight of the product measured in short tons one short ton is equal to 2000 pounds references to uan product tons assume a 32 nitrogen content basis for production volume 

we also provide certain supplementary volume information measured in nutrient tons nutrient tons represent the weight of the product’s nitrogen content which varies by product ammonia represents 82 nitrogen content granular urea represents 46 nitrogen content uan represents between 28 and 32 nitrogen content and an represents between 29 and 35 nitrogen content 

reportable segments 

our reportable segments consist of the following segments ammonia granular urea uan an other and phosphate these segments are differentiated by products we use gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources total other operating costs and expenses consisting of selling general and administrative expenses and other operating—net and nonoperating expenses interest and income taxes are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management see note 21—segment disclosures  for additional information 

nitrogen product segments   

we are the largest nitrogen fertilizer producer in north america our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia granular urea uan and an our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products from our nitrogen product segments  are shown in the following table net sales do not reflect amounts used internally such as ammonia in the manufacture of other products

in 2016 our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consumed in the aggregate approximately 295 million mmbtus of natural gas in 2017 the amount of natural gas consumed by our nitrogen manufacturing facilities will increase as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects we employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced supply of natural gas we also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices see note 15—derivative financial instruments  for additional information about our natural gas hedging activities 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the safe efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer products to terminals warehouses and customers each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location 

our north american nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the us and canada with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5700 tank and hopper cars as well as railcars provided by rail carriers our united kingdom nitrogen production facilities mainly ship products via truck 

the north american waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our donaldsonville verdigris and yazoo city facilities to ship ammonia and uan we employ a fleet of ten tow boats and thirtytwo river barges which are 

cf industries holdings inc 

primarily leased we also utilize contract marine services to move urea fertilizer we can also export nitrogen fertilizer products via seagoing vessels from our donaldsonville yazoo city billingham and ince manufacturing facilities 

three of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia the donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2000mile long nustar pipeline through which we have the ability to transport ammonia to more than 20 terminals and shipping points in the midwestern us corn belt our verdigris and port neal facilities are connected to the 1100mile long magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the us midwest 

phosphate segment 

the phosphate segment reflects the reported results of the phosphate business through march 17 2014 plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after march 17 2014 the remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014 therefore the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter 

our historical sales of phosphate fertilizer products are shown in the table below 



gross margin for the phosphate segment was 10 million for the year ended december 31 2014  

storage facilities and other properties 

as of december 31 2016  we owned or leased space at 91  inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 23state region of the united states canada and the united kingdom including storage at our production facilities we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately 37 million  tons of fertilizer our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table 



 

 customers 

the principal customers for our nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products are cooperatives independent fertilizer distributors farmers and industrial users chs was our largest customer in 2016  and accounted for approximately 12  of our consolidated net sales sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force 

cf industries holdings inc 

competition 

our markets are global and intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium inc koch fertilizer llc and potash corporation of saskatchewan inc additionally iowa fertilizer company and yara basf are expected to bring new north american nitrogen fertilizer production facilities on line in 2017 there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition from foreignsourced products continuously 

our primary united kingdom competition comes from imported products supplied by companies including yara international origin fertilisers bunn fertiliser limited koch ameropa chs and helm urea and uan are not produced in the united kingdom but along with an are widelytraded fertilizer products with limited barriers to entry 

seasonality 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

financial information about foreign and domestic sales and operations 

the amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying value of our foreign and domestic longlived assets are set forth in note 21—segment disclosures  

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act tsca and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment we may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future 

environmental health and safety expenditures 

our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2016  totaled approximately 29 million we estimate that we will have approximately 37 million of capital expenditures for environmental health and safety in 2017  environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

clean air act—section 185 fee 

our donaldsonville nitrogen complex is located in a fiveparish region near baton rouge louisiana that as of 2005 was designated as being in severe nonattainment with respect to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone the 1hour ozone standard pursuant to the federal clean air act the act section 185 of the act requires states in their state implementation plans to levy a fee section 185 fee on major stationary sources such as the donaldsonville complex located in a severe nonattainment area that did not meet the 1hour ozone standard by november 30 2005 see note 20—contingencies  for additional information on the section 185 fee 

clean air act information request 

on february 26 2009 we received a letter from the environmental protection agency epa under section 114 of the act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with new source review and new source performance standards at our donaldsonville facility see note 20—contingencies  for additional information on the clean air act information request 

cerclaremediation matters 

from time to time we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws in 2011 we received a notice from the idaho department of environmental quality ideq that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho the current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site we and the current owner are currently conducting a remedial investigationfeasibility study of the site in 2015 we and several other parties received a notice that the us department of interior and other trustees intend to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for a group of former phosphate mines in southeast idaho including the former georgetown canyon mine see note 20—contingencies  for additional information on the cerclaremediation matters 

regulation of greenhouse gases 

we are subject to regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states concerning greenhouse gas ghg emissions 

the united kingdom is a party to the kyoto protocol as a result of agreements reached during a conference in durban south africa in 2011 the kyoto protocol will continue in force for a second commitment period which will expire by 2020 on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15°c above preindustrial levels the paris agreement which has been accepted by the united states and ratified by canada and the united kingdom went into effect in november 2016 the paris agreement could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the united kingdom has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas trading system our uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require these plants to purchase co 2  emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our uk sites are also subject to the european union emissions trading scheme 

canada withdrew from further participation in the kyoto protocol in december 2011 but is a party to the paris agreement in canada we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canadas national pollutant release inventory and ontarios mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation in october 2016 canadian prime minister justin trudeau announced that his government will introduce a plan to put a price on carbon pollution which plan would serve as a floor for the ghg emissions reduction requirements of the separate canadian provinces and territories the announced plan would impose a 10 per ton canadian dollars charge beginning in 2018 rising to 50 per ton by 2022 

ontario is party to the western climate initiative wci comprising california and several canadian provinces on january 1 2017 ontario launched its own ghg cap and trade program under this program the ontario government will set a hard limit on emissions which will steadily decline annually facilities that generate more than 25000 tonnes of ghg emissions per year will be required to participate in the cap and trade program and will require emissions allowances for every 

cf industries holdings inc 

tonne of ghg emitted in 2018 the government of ontario intends to link its cap and trade program with wci the current cap will mandate that by 2020 ghg emissions decline by 15 below levels seen in 1990 

 in alberta the specified gas emitters regulation ghg regulation was implemented in 2007 this program requires facilities emitting more than 100000 tons of ghgs per year to reduce emissions by 12 over such facilities 2007 levels to meet this requirement companies can reduce emissions purchaseuse offset credits or contribute to a technology fund at an annual rate of 15 per ton of co 2  currently our medicine hat facility’s method of compliance is to make contributions to the technology fund in june 2016 alberta promulgated the climate leadership implementation act which will impose a wideranging carbon tax the carbon tax will be set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2018 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafter facilities such as ours that are subject to the existing specified gas emitters regulation will continue to be subject to this regulation in the near term after which new product and sectorbased performance standards to be developed will become effective 

the united states is not a party to the kyoto protocol but is a party to the paris agreement however as a result of the recent presidential election the united states may decide to withdraw from the paris agreement or the united nations framework convention on climate change which would also result in withdrawal from the paris agreement or prior to taking such actions could disregard its commitments under the paris agreement the impact of such actions if they take place on the future implementation of the paris agreement is uncertain in the united states ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels although some of the more significant developments to date including epas clean power plan do not directly impose obligations on our facilities the epa has issued a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and report the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result are required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd construction permit applicable to such facilities we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to ghgs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects other than the states implementation of this permitting requirement none of the states where our us production facilities are located—iowa louisiana mississippi and oklahoma—has proposed control regulations limiting ghg emissions 

new source performance standards for nitric acid plants 

we operate 14 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides no x  notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas 

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals more stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits on december 15 2016 the epa redesignated the greater baton rouge nonattainment area brna where our donaldsonville facility is located to attainment with the 2008 8hour ozone standard however on october 26 2015 the epa published a more stringent national ambient air quality standard for ozone the state of louisiana has recommended to the epa that baton rouge be designated as nonattainment with the 2015 ozone standard such a classification in the baton rouge area or in other areas where our manufacturing facilities are located could result in more stringent air pollution emissions limits for our existing operations and would also subject our facilities to more stringent requirements to obtain approvals for plant expansions or could make it difficult to obtain such approvals the epa is supposed to designate areas under the 2015 standard by october 2017 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we employed approximately 2900 fulltime and 100 parttime employees

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage crop selection and fertilizer application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade 

periods of strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to stimulate global investment in production capacity the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply and demand balance in recent years fertilizer producers including cf holdings have built new production facilities or expanded capacity of existing production assets or announced plans to do so in the current environment global nitrogen fertilizer supply has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating a global nitrogen fertilizer oversupply leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices lower global production costs driven by lower feedstock costs and foreign exchange rate changes and reduced ocean freight costs have further contributed to the lower priced environment 

selling prices reached multiyear lows in 2016 the average selling price for our products in 2016 was 217  per ton compared to 314  per ton in 2015 a decline of 31  

additional production capacity is expected to come on line over the next twelve months we cannot predict the extent to which the current oversupply environment global or local economic and financial conditions or changes in such conditions or other factors may cause delays cancellation or acceleration of other announced andor ongoing projects 

we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line 

during periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production our financial performance credit ratings and the trading price for our common stock have been negatively impacted by the lower selling prices resulting from the current global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer the period of time that these conditions will persist and the degree to which they will impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows is uncertain 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality 

we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities consolidation in the industry has increased and future consolidation is expected to further increase the resources of several of our competitors for example in september 2016 our competitors agrium inc and potash corporation of saskatchewan inc announced plans to merge some of our competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships 

china the world’s largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers currently has significant capacity surplus and many highcost plants as a result the domestic nitrogen industry in china is operating at low rates if chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi or decreases in chinese producers’ underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage increased production capacity utilization any resulting export volume could adversely affect the balance 

cf industries holdings inc 

between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our competitors in russia have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity and continue to benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas which allows them to increase exports at aggressive prices depending on market conditions the 2016 revocations of us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia could lead to significant increases in imports from that country 

we also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe and latin america who depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the demand for our products 

conditions in us european and other global agriculture areas significantly impact our operating results agricultural planted areas and production can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control 

governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing “food versus fuel” debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand 

developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate or nitrogenefficient varieties could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products widespread adoption of emerging application technologies could disrupt traditional application practices affecting the volume or types of products used and timing of applications in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including any limitation on the use and application of chemical fertilizer could affect the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is dependent on natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea urea ammonium nitrate solution uan ammonium nitrate an and other nitrogen products 

because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2016 the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 149  per mmbtu on three consecutive days in march 2016 and a high of 377  per mmbtu on december 8 2016  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2016  the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 149  per mmbtu on three consecutive days in march 2016 and a high of 794  per mmbtu on march 5 2014  

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point during 2016 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 280  per mmbtu on september 1 september 12 and september 14 2016 and a high of 660  per mmbtu on december 30 2016  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2016  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 280  per mmbtu on september 1 september 12 and september 14 2016 and a high of 1110  per mmbtu on january 8 2014

changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas additionally increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production or increased demand were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states or elsewhere natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations and those of our joint venture are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and any delay or interruption in the delivery of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we and our joint venture use natural gas and other raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase the natural gas and other raw materials from third party suppliers our natural gas is transported by pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint venture by third party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties delays or interruptions in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials may be caused by among other things severe weather or natural disasters unscheduled downtime labor difficulties insolvency of our suppliers or their inability to meet existing contractual arrangements deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents or mechanical failures our joint venture point lisas nitrogen limited has experienced numerous natural gas curtailments as discussed in the risk factor below titled we are exposed to risks associated with our joint venture in addition the transport of natural gas by pipeline is subject to additional risks including delays or interruptions caused by capacity constraints leaks or ruptures any delay or interruption in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials even for a limited period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers and are subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight this exposes us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to additional liability 

we rely on railroad truck pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and operating hazards additionally due to the aging infrastructure of certain bridges roadways rail lines river locks and equipment that our third party service providers utilize we may experience delays in both the receipt of raw materials or the shipment of finished product while repairs maintenance or replacement activities are conducted also certain third party service providers particularly railroads have experienced periodic service slowdowns due to capacity constraints in their systems which impact the shipping times of our products 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents discharges or other releases of hazardous substances terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives governmental entities could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products 

if shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies’ failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the united states and canada the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads’ potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads have implemented tariffs that include 

cf industries holdings inc 

provisions that purport to shift liability to shippers to the extent that liabilities arise from third parties with insufficient resources if successful these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products increases in transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors and any railroad industry initiatives that may impact our ability to transport our products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacture transportation storage and distribution of chemical products including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled plant downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage there can be no assurance that we will be able to buy and maintain insurance with adequate limits and reasonable pricing terms and conditions 

in april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities have been named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases have been consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption “in re west explosion cases” the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325 individuals and 80 insurance companies plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident the court granted in part and denied in part the cf entities’ motions for summary judgment in august 2015 thirtyfour cases have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements fully funded by insurance the remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pretrial proceedings the next group of cases was reset for trial beginning on april 3 2017 we believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the cf entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits the increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilities

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow prevent us from fulfilling our obligations and impair our ability to pursue or achieve other business objectives 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 578 billion  of total funded indebtedness consisting primarily of secured and unsecured senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2018 and 2044 or approximately 47  of our total capitalization and an additional 695 million  of senior secured borrowing availability reflecting no outstanding borrowings and 55 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our senior secured revolving credit agreement as amended the revolving credit agreement our substantial debt service obligations will have an impact on our earnings and cash flow for so long as the indebtedness is outstanding 

our substantial indebtedness could through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it could 

 we expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our revolving credit agreement and the terms of our outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

our revolving credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions include covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries other than certain excluded subsidiaries to among other things 

  in addition our revolving credit agreement requires us to comply with consolidated interest coverage ratio total debt to capital ratio and consolidated secured leverage ratio maintenance covenants 

cf industries holdings inc 

certain of these restrictions could be suspended if and for so long as we satisfy certain investment grade corporate rating and consolidated leverage tests however we cannot assure you that we will meet these tests or if we do that we will be able to maintain compliance with those conditions 

as a result of these restrictions and covenants under our existing indebtedness including our senior secured notes we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include additional or more restrictive covenants we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants under the terms of our indebtedness or if we fail to do so that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend such covenants 

we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 

the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur additional debt in the future including additional secured and unsecured indebtedness the indentures governing our senior secured notes do not limit incurrence by us of additional unsecured indebtedness and will permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness subject to certain restrictions although our revolving credit agreement contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness these restrictions are subject to exceptions and qualifications which allow us to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness in limited amounts if we incur additional indebtedness the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could intensify if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate our relations with our creditors including the holders of our outstanding debt securities the lenders under our revolving credit agreement and our suppliers may be materially and adversely affected 

a breach of the covenants under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under such agreements 

our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness will depend upon our future performance and various other factors such as market prices for our fertilizer products natural gas prices and other business competitive and regulatory factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to maintain compliance with all of these covenants in that event we would need to seek an amendment to our debt agreements or would need to refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we can obtain future amendments or waivers of our debt agreements and instruments or refinance our debt and even if we were able to do so such relief might only last for a limited period potentially necessitating additional amendments waivers or refinancings any noncompliance by us with the covenants under our debt agreements and instruments could result in an event of default under those debt agreements and instruments an event of default under an agreement or instrument governing any of our indebtedness may allow our creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if our lenders or holders of our debt securities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we may be forced to liquidate certain assets to repay all or part of our indebtedness which could materially and adversely impair our business operations an event of default under our revolving credit agreement would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under our revolving credit agreement furthermore our revolving credit agreement and senior secured notes provide for liens on specified collateral to secure our obligations thereunder and if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under our revolving credit agreement or the senior secured notes our revolving credit agreement lenders or holders of the senior secured notes as applicable could proceed against the collateral granted to them which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness we cannot assure that we would have sufficient assets to make such repayment 

potential future downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

in october 2016 each of the three credit rating agencies reviewed our corporate credit rating as follows sp global ratings reduced our corporate credit rating to bb from bbb and indicated the outlook was negative moody’s investors service inc reduced our corporate credit rating to baa3 from baa2 and indicated the rating was under further review and fitch ratings inc reduced our corporate credit rating to bb from bbb and indicated the outlook was stable in november 2016 moody’s investors service inc further reduced our corporate credit rating to ba2 from baa3 and updated the outlook to stable these ratings and our current credit condition affect among other things our ability to access new capital especially debt and negative changes in these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt our credit ratings could be downgraded or rating agencies could issue adverse commentaries in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity in particular a weakening of our financial condition including a significant increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook or otherwise increase our cost of borrowing

cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results 

we rely on information technology and computer control systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications the management of our accounting financial and supply chain functions and plant operations business and supply chain disruptions plant and utility outages and information technology system and network disruptions due to cyber attacks could seriously harm our operations and materially adversely affect our operating results cyber security risks include attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers damage or loss of information due to viruses the unintended disclosure of confidential information the misuse or loss of control over computer control systems and breaches due to employee error our exposure to cyber security risks includes exposure through third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we routinely review and implement security procedures and measures in order to protect our systems and information from being vulnerable to evolving cyber attacks we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate prevent or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks compromises to our information and control systems could have severe financial and other business implications 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations 

weather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting growing harvesting or application periods may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following application period resulting in lower demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions during or following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freezeoffs or hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise 

our ability to use our tax net operating losses and certain other tax assets to offset taxable income could be negatively impacted if there is a change in our ownership 

we estimate that we generated a federal tax net operating loss of approximately 2 billion in 2016 arising primarily from accelerated federal tax depreciation and federal bonus depreciation on our capital projects in addition we generated significant state income tax loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards as a result of state tax depreciation and loss carryforwards as well as foreign tax credit carryforwards we project that we will generate additional federal tax loss carryforwards in 2017 primarily arising from accelerated federal tax depreciation on our capital projects our ability to use our tax net operating losses tax credits and certain other tax assets the tax benefits to offset taxable income could be substantially limited if we experienced an “ownership change” as defined under section 382 of the internal revenue code and related internal revenue service irs pronouncements in general an ownership change would occur if the company’s “5percent shareholders” as defined under section 382 collectively increase their ownership in the company by more than 50 percentage points during the relevant testing period additionally various states have similar limitations on the use of state net operating losses following an ownership change 

if an ownership change occurs our ability to use our tax benefits to reduce taxable income is generally limited to an annual amount equal to 1 the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the longterm taxexempt interest rate plus 2 builtin gains on certain assets held prior to the ownership change that are recognized during the fiveyear period following the ownership change 

on september 6 2016 the board adopted a tax benefits preservation plan the plan designed to preserve our ability to utilize our tax benefits although the plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect us there is no assurance that the restrictions on transferability in the plan will prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change 

cf industries holdings inc 

in addition we intend to file a claim to carry back federal and state tax losses from 2016 to prior income tax years and receive a refund of federal and state taxes paid in those prior years we currently estimate that the amount of this refund will be approximately 800 million and expect to receive it in the third quarter of 2017 the majority of the refund relates to accelerated depreciation on the donaldsonville and port neal capacity expansion projects and certain 2016 operating losses and other expenditures 

tax matters including changes in tax laws or rates adverse determinations by taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in the united states where most of our operations are located and numerous foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized tax rates in various jurisdictions in which we operate may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in our mix of earnings from countries with differing statutory tax rates and tax systems changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the irs and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the united states although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have used the cash we generate outside the united states primarily to fund development of our business in nonus jurisdictions if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the united states we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the united states under current us tax laws those international earnings would be subject to us tax and the repatriation of those earnings could result in an increase in our worldwide effective tax rate and an increase in our use of cash to pay us income taxes 

we also need to comply with other new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs or value added taxes or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are continually under review by congress the irs and the us department of the treasury according to publicly released statements a top legislative priority of the new congress and administration may be to enact significant reform of the internal revenue code including but not limited to significant changes to the taxation of business entities and the deductibility of interest expense and capital investment there is a substantial lack of clarity as to the likelihood timing and details of any such tax reform and the impact of any potential tax reform on us and we cannot at this time determine whether any such changes will adversely affect us or our taxation 

we may not be successful in the expansion of our business 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both within the united states and elsewhere major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments require significant managerial resources the diversion of which from our other activities may impair the operation of our business we may be unable to identify or successfully compete for certain acquisition targets which may hinder or prevent us from acquiring a target or completing other transactions the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or business combination transactions are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments among the risks associated with the pursuit and consummation of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments or business combination transactions are those involving 



cf industries holdings inc 

 international acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combinations or investments and other international expansions of our business involve additional risks and uncertainties including but not limited to 

 if we finance acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints under the terms of and as a result of the repayment and debtservice obligations under the additional indebtedness a business combination transaction between us and another company could result in our stockholders receiving cash or shares of another entity on terms that such stockholders may not consider desirable moreover the regulatory approvals associated with a business combination may result in divestitures or other changes to our business the effects of which are difficult to predict 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws regulations and permitting requirements as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes 

as a fertilizer company working with hazardous substances our business faces risks of spills discharges or other releases of those substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current facilities or facilities previously owned by us or other acquired businesses adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental health and safety laws change regularly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental health and safety laws and regulations we may be subject to more stringent 

cf industries holdings inc 

enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures we sell among other products diesel exhaust fluid which is subject to epa emissions standards that may become more stringent in the future our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion or modification of our operations is predicated upon securing necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval or a determination that we have violated a law or permit as a result of a governmental inspection of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at our facilities and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows on october 26 2015 the epa published a final regulation lowering the national ambient air quality standard for ozone ozone attainment designations are expected by october 2017 and this action is expected to result in additional areas of the country being classified as being in nonattainment with the ozone standard and subject to more stringent permitting requirements which in turn could make it much more difficult and expensive to obtain permits to construct new facilities or expand our existing operations 

future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to greenhouse gas regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states in the united states our existing facilities currently are only subject to ghg emissions reporting obligations although our new and modified facilities are likely to be subject to ghg emissions standards included in their air permits our facilities in the united kingdom are subject to regulatory emissions trading systems which generally require us to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset ghg emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program our facility in alberta canada is subject to a provincial regulation requiring reductions in the facility’s net emissions intensity which can be met by facility improvements the purchase of emissions offsets or performance credits or contributions to a nonprofit climate change fund established by alberta in june 2016 alberta promulgated the climate leadership implementation act which will impose a wideranging carbon tax the carbon tax will be set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2018 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafter facilities such as ours that are subject to the existing specified gas emitters regulation will continue to be subject to this regulation in the near term after which new product and sectorbased performance standards to be developed will become effective our courtright ontario facility will be subject to ontario’s ghg cap and trade program beginning in january 2017 which regulation was finalized in may 2016 in addition in october 2016 canadian prime minister justin trudeau announced that his government will introduce a plan to put a nationwide price on carbon emissions which plan would serve as a floor for the ghg emissions reduction requirements of the separate canadian provinces and territories the announced plan would impose a 10 per ton canadian dollars charge beginning in 2018 rising to 50 per ton by 2022 

there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2 °c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15 °c above preindustrial levels the paris agreement which has been accepted by the united states and ratified by canada and the united kingdom went into effect in november 2016 however as a result of the recent presidential election the united states may decide to withdraw from the paris agreement or the united nations framework convention on climate change which would also result in withdrawal from the paris agreement or prior to taking such actions could disregard its commitments under the paris agreement the impact of such actions if they take place on the future implementation of the paris agreement is uncertain if the paris agreement remains in effect it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output 

cf industries holdings inc 

require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states canada or the united kingdom our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us 

our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season 

if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from us 

a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assets 

any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months 

we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses 

we often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased fertilizers we have used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts 

our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the 

cf industries holdings inc 

extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidity 

hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position additionally the international swaps and derivative association master netting arrangements for most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position 

the counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments or by the trigger of any cross default provisions or credit support requirements 

we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities 

our nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in nine separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represented approximately 40  of our ammonia production capacity as of december 31 2016  including the donaldsonville and port neal capacity expansion projects which were completed in 2016 the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane or high wind activity and our other complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas in the respective regions moreover our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace and could result in operational disruptions 

we are subject to risk associated with our strategic venture with chs inc 

we may not realize the full benefits from our strategic venture with chs that are expected the realization of the expected benefits of the chs strategic venture depends on our ability to successfully operate and manage the strategic venture and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with chs over the life of the agreement among other factors additionally any challenges related to the chs strategic venture could harm our relationships with chs or our other customers 

we are exposed to risks associated with our joint venture 

we have a 50 ownership interest in plnl which owns and operates an ammonia production facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago our joint venture partner shares a measure of control over the operations of our plnl joint venture as a result our investment in our plnl joint venture involves risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our plnl joint venture or our partner have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to or have veto rights over our instructions requests policies or objectives subject our plnl joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business 

in addition we may become involved in disputes with our plnl joint venture partner which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

plnls ammonia plant relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited pursuant to a gas sales contract the ngc contract the joint venture has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which have reduced the ammonia production at plnl in 2016 ngc communicated to plnl that it does not recognize the joint venture’s exercise of its option to renew the ngc contract for an additional fiveyear term beyond its current termination date in september 2018 and that any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2018 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price plnl has initiated arbitration proceedings against ngc and asserted claims in connection with ngc’s failure to supply the contracted quantities of natural gas and its refusal to recognize the joint venture’s exercise of its option to extend the ngc contract plnl is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages for 

cf industries holdings inc 

past and ongoing curtailments although the joint venture believes its claims against ngc to be meritorious it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration there are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture that are uncertain at this time including the quantities of gas ngc will make available the cost of such gas the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing 

as part of our impairment assessment of our equity method investment in plnl we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a 134 million  impairment charge in 2016 previously in 2015 we recognized an impairment charge of 62 million  related to our equity method investment in plnl the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2016  is approximately 139 million  failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture and could result in further impairment to the value of the joint venture such as ceasing operations and writing off the remaining investment in plnl which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives we are subject to various security laws and regulations in the united states these security laws include the maritime transportation security act of 2002 and the chemical facilities antiterrorism standards regulation in addition president obama issued executive order 13650 improving chemical facility safety and security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives it is possible that governmental entities in the united states or elsewhere could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for us 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations 

our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions 

our principal reporting currency is the us dollar and our business operations and investments outside the united states increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change including for example in response to sudden global economic conditions resulting from measures like the referendum in the united kingdom in june 2016 which resulted in a vote in favor of exiting the european union brexit we may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by among other things requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in or indexed to the us dollar or a currency freely convertible into us dollars or hedging through foreign currency derivatives these efforts however may not be effective and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs in various jurisdictions including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 and economic sanctions programs administered by the united nations the european union and the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury and regulations set forth under the comprehensive iran accountability divestment act as a result of doing business internationally we are exposed to a risk of violating anticorruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we our partners or agents operate violations of anticorruption and sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from 

cf industries holdings inc 

government contracts and termination of existing contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment the violation of applicable laws by our employees consultants agents or partners could subject us to penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation administration and enforcement will change over time changes in antitrust laws globally or in their interpretation administration or enforcement may limit our existing or future operations and growth 

deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers’ reluctance to replenish inventories changes in global economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such changes can be difficult to ascertain resulting in anxiety among market participants that can persist for protracted periods for example concern and uncertainty over the potential impact of brexit on the global economy has resulted in increased volatility in global financial markets the overall impact of changes in global economic conditions on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted 

in addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizers significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen fertilizers into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate that affect foreign trade and investment

litigation 

west fertilizer co 

on april 17 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities have been named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases have been consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption in re west explosion cases the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325 individuals and 80 insurance companies plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident 

the court granted in part and denied in part the cf entities motions for summary judgment in august 2015 thirtyfour cases have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements fully funded by insurance the remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pretrial proceedings the next group of cases was reset for trial beginning on april 3 2017 while we believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the cf entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits including in any appeals that may follow we have concluded based on continuing developments in the case that some loss is probable for a subset of the outstanding claims we have made an accrual for this subset of the outstanding claims which is not material to the consolidated financial statements beyond the amounts accrued the company cannot provide a range of reasonably possible loss due to the lack of damages discovery for the remaining claims and the uncertain nature of this litigation including uncertainties around the potential allocation of responsibility by a jury to other defendants or responsible third parties the recognition of a potential loss in the future in the west fertilizer co litigation could negatively affect our results in the period of recognition however based upon currently available information including available insurance coverage we do not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

industry factors and market conditions   

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global commodities 

our products are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition the customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality the selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions and changes in supply and demand 

global supply and demand factors 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth gross domestic product growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption governmental regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key exportingconsuming countries such as china india russia and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of nitrogenbased fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for these commodities 

over the last decade strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity as a result global nitrogen fertilizer supply increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating the current global oversupply in the market and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in addition lower global production costs driven by lower feedstock costs and foreign exchange rate changes and reduced ocean freight costs have further contributed to the lower priced environment 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental trade policies the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last decade has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america including our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east ukraine the republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa russia and china are major exporters to north america 

farmers economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns crop prices and the types of crops planted

2016 market conditions 

our 2016 results were impacted by excess global nitrogen supply and the resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices the us gulf is a major global fertilizer pricing point due to the volume of nitrogen fertilizer that trades there through most of 2016 nitrogen pricing at the us gulf declined often trading below parity with other international pricing points due to excess global nitrogen supply as a result of continued imports from various exporting regions and decreased buyer interest seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multiyear lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of the year the average selling price for our products in 2016 was 217  per ton compared to 314  per ton in 2015 a decrease of 31  resulting in a decrease in both net sales and gross margin of approximately 138 billion  between the periods the decline in selling prices has impacted each of our reportable segments in addition during periods of declining prices customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation of prices in the future being lower than current prices which has also negatively impacted our sales volume 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 the following developments impacted the global nitrogen fertilizer market 

 these factors have led to an increase in global nitrogen pricing at the end of 2016 a significant amount of new nitrogen production capacity came on line in 2016 and additional production capacity is expected to come on line in 2017 including a significant increase in production capacity located in north america the new capacity will further increase supply we expect nitrogen fertilizer prices to rise going into the 2017 spring application season due to seasonal demand however we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line

cf industries holdings inc 



the following describes the significant items that impacted the comparability of our financial results in 2016 2015 and 2014 descriptions of items below that refer to amounts in the table above refer to the pretax amounts 

capacity expansion projects 

in 2016 we completed capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa these projects originally announced in 2012 included the construction of new ammonia urea and uan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex these plants increased our overall production capacity by approximately 25 improved our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville and improved our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location in combination these new facilities are able to produce 21 million tons of gross ammonia per year upgraded products ranging from 20 million to 27 million tons of granular urea per year and up to 18 million tons of uan 32 solution per year depending on our choice of product mix these new facilities will allow us to benefit from the cost advantages of north american natural gas 

at our donaldsonville complex the ammonia plant was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2016 the uan plant was placed in service in the first quarter of 2016 and the granular urea plant was placed in service during fourth quarter of 2015 at our port neal iowa complex both the ammonia and granular urea plants were placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2016 the total capital cost of the capacity expansion projects was 52 billion  depreciation expense pertaining to each of our capacity expansion plants commenced once the respective plant was placed in service total depreciation expense pertaining to our capacity expansion plants recognized in 2016 and 2015 was 116 million  and 13 million  respectively 

startup costs of 52 million  which primarily relate to the cost of commencing production at the ammonia plants were incurred in 2016 expansion project expenses consisting primarily of administrative costs and other project costs that do not qualify for capitalization totaled 73 million  51 million  and 31 million  in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

losses on foreign currency derivatives of 22 million  and 38 million  in 2015 and 2014 respectively relate to hedges of european euro denominated equipment purchased as part of the capacity expansion projects 

strategic venture with chs 

we commenced a strategic venture with chs on february 1 2016 at which time chs purchased a minority equity interest in cfn for 28 billion chs also began receiving deliveries pursuant to a supply agreement under which chs has the right to purchase annually from cfn up to approximately 11 million tons of granular urea and 580000 tons of uan at market prices as a result of its minority equity interest in cfn chs is entitled to semiannual cash distributions from cfn we are also entitled to semiannual cash distributions from cfn the amounts of distributions from cfn to us and chs are based generally on the profitability of cfn and determined based on the volume of granular urea and uan sold by cfn to us and chs pursuant to supply agreements less a formula driven amount based primarily on the cost of natural gas used to produce the granular urea and uan and adjusted for the allocation of items such as operational efficiencies and overhead amounts we began recognizing the noncontrolling interest pertaining to chs’ ownership interest in cfn on february 1 2016 and during 2016 we recognized 93 million  of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in cfn see note 17—noncontrolling interests  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our strategic venture with chs 

cf industries holdings inc 

under the terms of our strategic venture with chs if our credit rating is reduced below certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies we are required to make a nonrefundable yearly payment of 5 million to chs during 2016 our credit rating was reduced and we made the first payment to chs the payments continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or february 1 2026 we recognized this term of the strategic venture as an embedded derivative and recorded a charge of 23 million in 2016 for this item 

debt restructuring 

due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future in the fourth quarter of 2016 we took certain steps with respect to the revolving credit agreement and our senior notes due 2022 2025 and 2027 the private senior notes on november 21 2016 we prepaid the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of the private senior notes and paid the related makewhole amount of approximately 170 million we made the prepayment and makewhole payment using the proceeds from an offering of 125 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes comprising 500 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2021 and 750 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2026 collectively referred to as the “senior secured notes” we recognized 167 million of the 170 million cash makewhole payment on the private senior notes as a debt extinguishment charge with the 3 million remainder being a debt modification cost that will be amortized over the term of the senior secured notes 

in connection with the completion of the offering of the senior secured notes and the prepayment of the private senior notes certain amendments to the revolving credit agreement became effective the amendments included among other things changes in and additions to the financial and other covenants and a reduction in the size of the facility from 15 billion to 750 million

other items 

unrealized net marktomarket gain loss on natural gas derivatives   natural gas is typically the largest and most volatile single component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased products we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivatives that we use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting this can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives in 2016 2015 and 2014 we recognized unrealized net marktomarket gains losses on natural gas derivatives of 260 million  176 million  and 79 million  respectively which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 

loss gain on foreign currency transactions including intercompany loans    in 2016 and 2015 we recognized losses gains of 93 million and 8 million respectively from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily british pound and canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that are not permanently invested in 2014 we recognized a 15 million gain from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested 

gain on sale of phosphate business   on march 17 2014 we sold our phosphate mining and manufacturing business to the mosaic company mosaic and recognized a pretax gain on the sale of the phosphate business of 750 million under the terms of the definitive transaction agreement the accounts receivable and accounts payable pertaining to the phosphate mining and manufacturing business and certain phosphate inventory held in distribution facilities were not sold to mosaic in the transaction and were settled in the ordinary course 

upon selling the phosphate business we began to supply mosaic with ammonia produced by our plnl joint venture the contract to supply ammonia to mosaic from our plnl joint venture represents the continuation of a supply practice that previously existed between our former phosphate mining and manufacturing business and other operations of the company prior to march 17 2014 plnl sold ammonia to us for use in the phosphate business and the cost was included in our production costs in our phosphate segment subsequent to the sale of the phosphate business we now sell the plnlsourced ammonia to mosaic the revenue from these sales to mosaic and the costs to purchase the ammonia from plnl are now included in our ammonia segment our 50 share of the operating results of our plnl joint venture continues to be included in our equity in earnings of operating affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations because of the significance of this continuing supply practice in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the phosphate mining and manufacturing business is not reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations

the following table presents our consolidated results of operations and supplemental data 

 

nm—not meaningful 



cf industries holdings inc 

 year ended december 31 2016  compared to year ended december 31 2015   

consolidated operating results 

our reportable segments consist of ammonia granular urea uan an and other and include the results of cf fertilisers uk from july 31 2015 the date we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk 

we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of 277 million  in 2016  compared to net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 700 million  in 2015  a decline  of 977 million  we experienced lower  net earnings attributable to common stockholders in 2016 compared to 2015  due primarily to a lower  gross margin as a result of lower average selling prices resulting from excess global nitrogen supply combined with a number of significant items that are described above under overview of cf holdings — items affecting comparability of results 

our total gross margin declined  by 707 million  or 46  to 840 million  in 2016  from 155 billion  in 2015  the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition increased gross margin by 18 million  or 1 the remaining decline  in our gross margin of 725 million was due primarily to lower  average selling prices and higher capacity expansion project related costs partially offset by the impact of unrealized net marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives increased sales volume and lower physical natural gas costs and production costs 

 during 2016 primarily as a result of lower  net earnings our income tax benefit provision declined by 464 million  to a net benefit of 68 million  from an income tax provision of 396 million  for 2015 see note 10—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information on our income tax benefit 

net sales 

our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

our total net sales decreased   623 million  or 14  to 369 billion  in 2016  compared to 431 billion  in 2015  the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition increased our net sales by 269 million  or 6 the remaining decline  in our net sales of 892 million or 21 was due to a 31 decline  in average selling prices partially offset by a 14 increase in sales volume 

cf industries holdings inc 

average selling prices excluding the cf fertilisers uk acquisition impact were 218 per ton in 2016 compared to 318 per ton in 2015 due primarily to lower selling prices across all products selling prices were negatively impacted by excess global nitrogen supply pricing for nitrogen fertilizer products in the us gulf declined during most of 2016 often trading below parity with other international pricing points as a result of continued imports from various exporting regions and decreased buyer interest seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multiyear lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of the year 

our total sales volume increase d by 24  from 2015 to 2016 the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition increased our sales volume by 10 the remaining increase  in our sales volume of 14 was due primarily to greater granular urea and uan volume available for sale due to our completed capacity expansion projects partly offset by lower ammonia sales volume due to lower demand in north america during the fall application season in addition our ammonia sales volumes were lower in 2016 as we upgraded existing ammonia production as a result of our granular urea and uan capacity expansion projects coming on line at our donaldsonville louisiana complex 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

our cost of sales increased   84 million  or 3  from 2015 to 2016 the overall increase in cost of sales is due primarily to the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition which increased cost of sales by 251 million or 9 as 2016 includes a full year of cf fertilisers uk results and 2015 includes five months of cf fertilisers uk results the remaining decrease  in our cost of sales of 167 million or 6 was due primarily to the combination of unrealized net marktomarket gain s on natural gas derivatives and lower realized natural gas costs partly offset by higher capacity expansion project related costs cost of sales includes a 260 million  unrealized net marktomarket gain  in 2016 as compared to a 176 million  unrealized net marktomarket loss  in 2015 realized natural gas costs including the impact of lower purchased natural gas costs and realized derivatives declined 6  from 328  per mmbtu in 2015 to 307  per mmbtu in 2016 as natural gas prices were lower in 2016 particularly in the first half of the year with high storage levels and strong production in north america although natural gas prices increased towards the end of 2016 

capacity expansion project costs including depreciation expense which commenced once the respective expansion plant was placed in service and startup costs which primarily relate to the cost of commencing production at the new ammonia plants for our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa plants totaled 116 million  and 52 million  in 2016 respectively 

cost of goods sold per ton declined 34 per ton or 17 from 201 in 2015 to 167 in 2016 as a result of the factors noted above 

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees including those for corporate initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses increase d 4 million  to 174 million  in 2016  from 170 million  in 2015  the increase  was due primarily to the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition partly offset by lower costs for corporate office initiatives and lower intangible asset amortization expense 

transaction costs 

transaction costs consist of various consulting and legal services associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of oci that was terminated on may 22 2016 our strategic venture with chs which began on february 1 2016 and our july 31 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us 

in 2016  we incurred 179 million  of transaction costs including the 150 million  termination fee paid by cf holdings to oci in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the termination of the combination agreement and costs for various consulting and legal services in 2015 we incurred 57 million  of transaction costs associated with the agreements pertaining to the proposed combination with certain businesses of oci and our strategic venture with chs

other operating—net 

other operating—net includes administrative costs associated with our capacity expansion projects and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations costs included in other costs can include foreign exchange gains and losses unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives costs associated with our closed facilities amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets 

other operating—net was 208 million   in 2016 compared to 92 million  in 2015  the increased  expense was due primarily to 93 million  of realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions primarily related to british pound sterling denominated intercompany debt that has not been permanently invested in addition the increased  expense also reflects higher expansion project costs pertaining to our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization and the loss of 23 million  representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with chs see note 9—fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information these increases were partly offset by a decrease in realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency derivatives of 22 million 

equity in losses earnings of operating affiliates 

equity in losses earnings of operating affiliates consists of our 50  ownership interest in plnl we include our share of the net earnings from our equity method investment in plnl as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition in 2016 and 2015 equity in losses earnings of operating affiliates also includes impairments of our equity method investment in plnl 

equity in losses earnings of operating affiliates decreased by 110 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  due primarily to a 134 million  impairment of our equity method investment in plnl that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recognized a 62 million  impairment of our equity method investment in plnl the remaining decrease was due primarily to lower operating results from plnl which included costs of 21 million that were incurred during 2016 related to a planned maintenance activity at the plnl ammonia plant that resulted in the shutdown of the plant for approximately 45 days and the impact of lower ammonia selling prices in 2016 compared to 2015 for additional information regarding the impairment of our equity method investment in plnl see note 8—equity method investments  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report and critical accounting policies and estimates below 

interest expense—net

net interest expense increased by 64 million  to 195 million  in 2016 from 131 million  in 2015 the 64 million   increase  in net interest expense was due primarily to the combination of higher debt levels due to the issuance of 10 billion of private senior notes in september 2015 and debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs due to the restructuring of our debt and the revolving credit agreement in 2016 due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future we modified the revolving credit agreement in 2016 by reducing its size from 20 billion to 750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms as a result of these changes we recognized 16 million  of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense the increase in interest expense—net in 2016 also includes the amortization of capitalized bridge credit agreement fees of 28 million  pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain of the oci businesses we also recorded capitalized interest of 166 million  in 2016   related primarily to our capacity expansion projects compared to 154 million  in 2015

loss on debt extinguishment 

loss on debt extinguishment of 167 million  consists of the makewhole payment which resulted from our november 21 2016 prepayment of the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of private senior notes this amount excludes 3 million of the 170 million makewhole payment which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees a reduction of longterm debt and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the senior secured notes 

income tax benefit provision 

our income tax benefit for 2016 was 68 million  on a pretax loss of 226 million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 300  compared to an income tax provision of 396 million  on pretax income of 106 billion  or an effective tax rate of 374  in the prior year 

state income taxes for 2016 were favorably impacted by investment tax credits of 13 million related to capital assets placed in service at our production facilities in oklahoma that are indefinitely available to offset income taxes in that jurisdiction in future years our effective state income tax rate was also reduced as a result of the changes to our legal entity structure effected in the first quarter of 2016 as part of our strategic venture with chs see note 17—noncontrolling interests  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information 

state income taxes for 2016 includes a tax benefit of 46 million net of federal tax effect for state net operating loss carryforwards a valuation allowance of 4 million is recorded for certain loss carryforwards for which we do not expect to realize in the future 

the income tax provision for 2016 includes the tax impact of the us manufacturing profits deductions claimed in prior years that will not be deductible as a result of our intention to carryback the tax net operating loss for the year ended december 31 2016 to those prior tax years 

nondeductible capital costs for the tax year ended december 31 2016 include certain transaction costs capitalized in the prior year that are now deductible as a result of the termination of the proposed combination with certain businesses of oci see note 4—acquisitions and divestitures  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information 

foreign subsidiaries of the company have incurred capital losses of 109 million that are indefinitely available to offset capital gains in those foreign jurisdictions as the future realization of these carryforwards is not anticipated a valuation allowance of 28 million was recorded in 2016 

in the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015 we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in plnl of 134 million  and 62 million  respectively which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates our respective income tax provisions do not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it will not give rise to a tax deduction 

during the third quarter of 2015 we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us and recognized a 94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk the earnings in cf fertilisers uk have been permanently reinvested therefore the recognition of the 94 million million gain on the remeasurement of the historical equity investment does not include the recognition of tax expense on the gain 

in addition our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in cfn and tnclp as our consolidated income tax provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in 2016 due to our strategic venture with chs that commenced on february 1 2016 at which time chs purchased a minority equity interest in cfn see note 17—noncontrolling interests  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information

cf industries holdings inc 

operating losses experienced at keytrade on july 31 2015 we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us for total consideration of 570 million and cf fertilisers uk became wholly owned by us and part of our consolidated financial results we recorded a 94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk in connection with the closing of the acquisition equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates — net of taxes on 2015 also included our share of cf fertilisers uk operating results up to the date of the acquisition in addition during the second quarter of 2015 we sold our interests in keytrade and recorded an aftertax loss of 29 million pretax loss of 40 million 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased   85 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  due primarily to the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in cfn this increase is partly offset by lower net earnings attributable to the approximately 247 interest of the publicly held common units of tnclp 

diluted net earnings loss per share attributable to common stockholders 

diluted net loss earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decrease d 415  to a loss of 119  per share in 2016  from diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders of 296  per share in 2015  this decrease  is due to lower net earnings

consolidated operating results 

the ammonia granular urea uan an and other segments are referred to in this section of the discussion and analysis as the “ nitrogen product segments ” 

our total gross margin declined  by 231 million  or 13  to 155 billion  in 2015  from 178 billion  in 2014  the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition increased gross margin by 23 million  the remaining decline  in our gross margin of 254 million  or 14  was due to the 244 million decrease  in gross margin in the nitrogen product segments  and the 10 million  decline in gross margin in the phosphate segment as the phosphate business was sold in the first quarter of 2014 the remaining decrease  in nitrogen product segments  gross margin as more fully described below was due primarily to lower average selling prices lower sales volume and the impact of marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives partially offset by lower physical natural gas costs 



cf industries holdings inc 

net earnings attributable to common stockholders was 700 million  and 139 billion  in the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the results of operations in 2015 and 2014 were impacted by a number of significant items that are described in further detail above under overview of cf holdings — items affecting comparability of results 

net sales 

our total net sales decreased   435 million  or 9  to 431 billion  in 2015  compared to 474 billion  in 2014  the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition increased our net sales by 208 million  the remaining decline  in our net sales of 643 million  or 14  included a 475 million   decrease  attributable to the nitrogen product segments and a 168 million   decrease  due to the sale of the phosphate business in march 2014 the remaining nitrogen product segments net sales decrease d due to an 8   decline  in average selling prices and a 3   decline  in sales volume 

nitrogen product segments average selling prices excluding the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition were 318  per ton in 2015  compared to 345  per ton in 2014  due primarily to lower uan granular urea and ammonia selling prices in 2015 as international nitrogen fertilizer prices declined due to excess global supply the combination of falling global production costs foreign currency devaluation and reduced ocean freight costs allowed many international producers to continue operations and the resulting supply weighed on global prices the decline in uan average selling prices was due primarily to excess global supply granular urea exports from china were at a record high in 2015 and russian exports increased significantly while global capacity additions in 2015 further contributed to the global supply excess and the decline in average selling prices compared to 2014 the decrease  in ammonia average selling prices from prior year levels is due primarily to weaker nitrogen fertilizer market conditions compared to the prior year as a weak fall application season combined with higher producer inventory levels and slowing demand from phosphate fertilizer producers weighed on prices at the end of 2015 

our total nitrogen product segments sales volume increased by 3 the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition increased our sales volume by 6 the remaining decline in our nitrogen product segments sales volume of 3 was due primarily to lower ammonia and uan sales volume our ammonia sales volume was lower in 2015 partly due to a poor fall application season in north america as a result of poor weather conditions in the midwest the season started late and ended early in november due to snow in the midwest in addition our ammonia and uan sales volume were lower as customers were hesitant to buy in a declining pricing environment 

cost of sales 

our total cost of sales decreased   204 million  or 7  from 2014  to 2015  including the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition which increased cost of sales by 185 million  or 6  the remaining decrease  in our cost of sales of 389 million or 13  was due primarily to lower natural gas costs the realized natural gas costs including the impact of lower purchased natural gas costs and realized derivative losses during 2015  decreased   28  compared to 2014  cost of sales in 2015  also included 176 million  of unrealized net marktomarket loss es on natural gas derivatives compared to loss es of 79 million  in 2014  lower gas costs were primarily driven by increasing north american natural gas production as increased well efficiencies increased supply warm weather conditions especially in the fourth quarter also contributed to the high storage levels and the resulting decline in gas prices the cost of sales per ton in our nitrogen product segments averaged 200  in 2015  a 5   decrease  from the 211  per ton in 2014  

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increase d 18 million  to 170 million  in 2015  from 152 million  in 2014  the increase  was due primarily to the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition an increase in corporate project activities and higher intangible asset amortization expense 

transaction costs 

in 2015  we incurred 57 million  of transaction costs for various consulting and legal services associated primarily with executing the strategic agreements in connection with and preparing for the proposed combination with certain businesses of oci our strategic venture with chs and our acquisition of the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk  not previously owned by us 

other operating—net 

other operating—net changed by 39 million  from 53 million  of expense  in 2014  to expense  of 92 million  in 2015  the increase d expense was due primarily to higher expansion project costs pertaining to our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization this was partially offset by the decrease  in realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency derivatives from 38 million  of loss es in 2014  to 22 million  of loss es in 2015  

cf industries holdings inc 

equity in losses earnings of operating affiliates 

equity in losses earnings of operating affiliates consists of our 50 share of the operating results of plnl equity in losses earnings of operating affiliates decreased by 78 million  in 2015  as compared to 2014  due primarily to a 62 million  impairment of our equity method investment in plnl that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015 the remaining decrease  was due primarily to lower operating results from plnl due to lower average selling prices 

interest expense—net 

interest expense—net was 131 million  in 2015  compared to 177 million  in 2014  the 46 million   decrease  in net interest expense was due primarily to higher amounts of capitalized interest related to our capacity expansion projects partially offset by higher interest expense pertaining to the 10 billion and 15 billion of senior notes issued in september 2015 and in march 2014 respectively we recorded capitalized interest of 154 million  in 2015  primarily related to our capacity expansion projects compared to 74 million  in 2014  

other nonoperating—net 

other nonoperating — net was a 4 million   expense  in 2015  compared to expense  of 2 million  in 2014  

income tax benefit provision 

our income tax provision for 2015  was 396 million  on pretax income of 106 billion  or an effective tax rate of 374  compared to an income tax provision of 773 million  on pretax income of 219 billion  or an effective tax rate of 353  in the prior year the increase  in the effective tax rate in 2015  was due primarily to the impact of certain transactional expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes the income tax provision in 2014 included 287 million of income tax expense relating to the phosphate business sale which increased the effective tax rate by 15 

during the third quarter of 2015 we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us and recognized a 94 million  gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk the earnings in cf fertilisers uk have been permanently reinvested therefore the recognition of the 94 million  gain on the remeasurement of the historical equity investment does not include the recognition of tax expense on the gain 

 in the fourth quarter of 2015 we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in plnl of 62 million  which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates in 2015 our income tax provision does not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it does not give rise to a tax deduction 

the effective tax rate does not reflect a tax provision on the earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest in tnclp a partnership which is not a taxable entity see note 10—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information on income taxes 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes  consists of our share of the financial results of unconsolidated joint venture interests in cf fertilisers uk  and keytrade during the second quarter of 2015 we sold our interests in keytrade on july 31 2015 we completed the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition for total consideration of 570 million and cf fertilisers uk  became wholly owned by us and became part of our consolidated financial results 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes   increase d by 49 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  due primarily to the 94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk  that was recorded in connection with the closing of the transaction this was partially offset by the combination of operating losses experienced at keytrade and from the loss on sale of our investments in keytrade during the second quarter of 2015 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased   13 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  due primarily to lower net earnings attributable to the approximately 247  interest of the publiclyheld common units of tnclp

net sales   total net sales in the ammonia segment decrease d by 542 million  or 36  to 981 million  in 2016  from 152 billion  in 2015  due primarily to a 33   decrease  in average selling prices and a 4   decrease  in sales volume these results include the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition which increased net sales by 26 million or 2 the remaining decrease  in our ammonia net sales of 568 million or 37 was due primarily to lower  average selling prices and sales volume selling prices declined due to excess global nitrogen supply in addition our selling prices reflect the impact of a higher proportion of export sales the volumes of which increased as a result of the weak fall application season attributable to the combined impact of weather conditions and low crop prices on our customers decisions related to applying fertilizer in the fall sales volume in 2016  declined due to combination of the weak fall application season and the impact of upgrading additional ammonia production at our donaldsonville facility into granular urea and uan as a result of our capacity expansion projects coming on line at our donaldsonville louisiana complex 

cost of sales   cost of sales per ton in our ammonia segment averaged 248  per ton in 2016  including the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition which averaged 220  per ton the remaining cost of sales per ton was 250 in 2016 a 16 decrease  from the 296  per ton in 2015  the decrease  was due primarily to the impact of unrealized net marktomarket gain s on natural gas derivatives in 2016 compared to losses in 2015 and to the impact of lower realized natural gas costs in 2016 this was partly offset by capacity expansion project startup costs of 50 million and an increase in expansion project depreciation as a result of the new ammonia plants at our donaldsonville and port neal facilities

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs working capital capital expenditures debt service investments taxes share repurchases and dividends our working capital requirements are affected by several factors including demand for our products selling prices raw material costs freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business generally our primary source of cash is cash from operations which includes cash generated by customer advances we may also from time to time access the capital markets or engage in borrowings under our credit agreements 

lower selling prices resulting from excess global nitrogen supply affected our financial performance in 2016 global nitrogen fertilizer supply increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating the current global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer and the resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices see discussion under overview of cf holdings—industry factors and market conditions—2016 market conditions above for further information 

in response to the prevailing market circumstances in july 2016 we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit agreement and in september 2016 we entered into an amendment to the note purchase agreement governing the private senior notes the note purchase agreement the amendments increased through the end of 2017 the maximum total leverage ratio permitted under the revolving credit agreement and the note purchase agreement and reduced the size of our revolving credit facility under the revolving credit agreement 

due to the uncertainty of the duration of the prevailing low price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future in the fourth quarter of 2016 we took certain additional steps with respect to the revolving credit agreement and the private senior notes the steps we took included entering into the november 2016 credit agreement amendment described under —debt—revolving credit agreement below and the prepayment in full of the 10 billion principal amount of private senior notes on november 21 2016 we funded that prepayment and the related makewhole amount of approximately 170 million  with the issuance of new longterm secured debt as described in further detail below under “—debt—senior secured notes” 

in 2016 we completed capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa that were originally announced in 2012 these projects provided us with an increase of approximately 25 in production capacity and had a total capital cost of 52 billion the completion of our capacity expansion projects will reduce what had been a substantial use of liquidity in recent years see “—capacity expansion projects and restricted cash” below for further information on these projects 

a significant portion of the capital assets that were constructed as part of the capacity expansion projects is expected to qualify for bonus depreciation under the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 the path act under the provisions of the path act eligible capital additions will be subject to 50 bonus depreciation we intend to file a claim to carry back the 2016 federal tax loss to prior periods and receive a refund of federal taxes paid in those prior years as of december 31 2016 we have prepaid income taxes of 841 million  which includes approximately 816 million  for the carryback of certain us tax losses from 2016 to prior tax periods see “—realization of current year tax assets resulting from bonus depreciation” below and note 10—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information

capacity expansion projects and restricted cash 

in 2016 we completed our capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa these projects originally announced in 2012 included the construction of new ammonia urea and uan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex these plants increased our overall production capacity by approximately 25 improved our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville and improved our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location in combination these new facilities are able to produce 21 million tons of gross ammonia per year upgraded products ranging from 20 million to 27 million tons of granular urea per year and up to 18 million tons of uan 32 solution per year depending on our choice of product mix these new facilities will allow us to benefit from the cost advantages of north american natural gas further details regarding our production capacity and production flexibility are included in part i item 1 business 

at our donaldsonville complex the ammonia plant was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2016 the uan plant was placed in service in the first quarter of 2016 and the granular urea plant was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2015 at our port neal iowa complex both the ammonia and granular urea plants were placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2016 depreciation expense pertaining to each of our capacity expansion plants commenced once the applicable plant was placed in service and the total depreciation expense pertaining to our capacity expansion plants recognized in 2016 and 2015 was 116 million  and 13 million  respectively 

startup costs of 52 million  which primarily relate to the cost of commencing production at the ammonia plants were incurred in 2016 expansion project expenses consisting primarily of administrative costs and other project costs that do not qualify for capitalization totaled 73 million  51 million  and 31 million  in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the total cash spent on capital expenditures for the capacity expansion projects through december 31 2016  was 51 billion  we estimate that the final payments on the capital component of the capacity expansion projects will occur in early 2017 and will bring the total capital cash spending for the capacity expansion projects to approximately 52 billion  

we retained an affiliate of thyssenkrupp industrial solutions thyssenkrupp to provide engineering and procurement services for both capacity expansion projects under the terms of the engineering and procurement services contract we granted thyssenkrupp a security interest in a restricted cash account and maintain a cash balance in that account equal to the cancellation fees for procurement services and equipment that would arise if we were to cancel the projects the amount in the account changes over time based on procurement costs as of december 31 2016  there was 5 million  held in this account this restricted cash is excluded from our cash and cash equivalents and reported separately on our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows 

capital spending 

we make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base increase our capacity improve plant efficiency and comply with various environmental health and safety requirements capital expenditures totaled 221 billion  in 2016  compared to 247 billion  in 2015  the decrease in capital expenditures is primarily the result of the decrease in cash spent on the capacity expansion projects in 2016  compared to 2015  

projected capital spending 

new capital expenditures for 2017  are estimated to be in the range of approximately 400 to 450 million for sustaining and other capital expenditures actual cash expenditures will also reflect amounts accrued but not paid in 2016 at december 31 2016 approximately 225 million  was accrued related to activities in 2016 planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting unanticipated increases in cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties 

realization of current year tax assets resulting from bonus depreciation 

the path act permits bonus depreciation on certain eligible capital additions in the year the assets are placed in service under the provisions of the path act eligible capital additions will be subject to 50 bonus depreciation in the year the asset is placed in service a significant portion of the capital assets constructed as part of the donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa capacity expansion projects is expected to qualify for 50 bonus depreciation given the size of the bonus depreciation tax deduction we estimate that we generated a substantial federal tax loss in 2016 we intend to file a claim to carry back the 2016 federal tax loss to prior income tax years and receive a refund of federal taxes paid in those prior years we currently estimate that the amount of this refund will be approximately 816 million  and expect to receive it in the third quarter of 2017 as of december 31 2016  we have prepaid income taxes in the amount of 841 million

government policies 

the policies or laws of governments around the world can result in the imposition of taxes duties tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world the policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers or farmers due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic political and social objectives additionally the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity the impact of changes in governmental policies or laws or the political or social objectives of a country could have a material impact on fertilizer demand selling prices and therefore could impact our liquidity 

ethanol industry and the renewable fuel standard 

corn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 37 of total us corn demand us government policy as expressed in the renewable fuel standard rfs is a major determinant for the ethanol market the rfs establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels including ethanol that must be included in the united states’ supply of fuel for transportation in addition the us congress at various times has proposed legislation to either reduce or eliminate the rfs while past legislation proposing changes to the rfs has not been enacted into law there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be enacted into law other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol gasoline and corn lower gasoline prices may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry which could impact the demand for corn and nitrogen fertilizer and therefore could impact our liquidity 

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

we have operations in canada the united kingdom and an interest in a joint venture in the republic of trinidad and tobago the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us are recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings are recognized unless the earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested based upon our current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurs at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings can occur in different periods cash balances held by our joint venture are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint venture on a periodic basis 

as of december 31 2016  approximately 127 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 116 billion  was held primarily by our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represents accumulated earnings of our foreign operations that are not considered to be permanently reinvested we have recognized deferred income taxes on these earnings for the foreign and domestic taxes that would be due upon their repatriation to the united states as of december 31 2016  the estimated cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian and united kingdom cash balances would be approximately 6 million

private senior notes   

the senior notes due 2022 2025 and 2027 the private senior notes issued by cf industries on september 24 2015 were governed by the terms of a note purchase agreement as amended including by an amendment effective september 7 2016 the note purchase agreement the private senior notes were guaranteed by cf holdings all obligations under the note purchase agreement were unsecured 

on november 21 2016 we prepaid in full the outstanding 10 billion  aggregate principal amount of our private senior notes the prepayment of 118 billion  included the payment of a makewhole amount of approximately 170 million  and accrued interest loss on debt extinguishment of 167 million  on our consolidated statement of operations excludes 3 million of the makewhole payment which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees a reduction of longterm debt and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the senior secured notes 

bridge credit agreement 

on september 18 2015 in connection with our proposed combination with certain businesses of oci cf holdings and cf industries entered into a senior unsecured 364 day bridge credit agreement as amended the bridge credit agreement upon the termination of the combination agreement on may 22 2016 the lenders’ commitments under the bridge credit agreement terminated automatically there were no borrowings under the bridge credit agreement see note 4—acquisitions and divestitures  and note 13—interest expense  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information 

forward sales and customer advances 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose therefore our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had 42 million  and 162 million  respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets 

while customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals during periods of declining prices such as the current environment customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the current prices if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase additionally borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity 

under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs for example natural gas costs including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 47  of our total production costs in 2016  as a result natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity 

cf industries holdings inc 

because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america have declined since 2008 but are subject to volatility during 2016 the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 149  per mmbtu on three consecutive days in march 2016 and a high of 377  per mmbtu on december 8 2016  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2016  the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 149  per mmbtu on three consecutive days in march 2016 and a high of 794  per mmbtu on march 5 2014  

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2016  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 280  per mmbtu on september 1 september 12 and september 14 2016 and a high of 660  per mmbtu on december 30 2016  during the threeyear period ended december 31 2016  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 280  per mmbtu on september 1 september 12 and september 14 2016 and a high of 1110  per mmbtu on january 8 2014  

natural gas costs in our cost of sales including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives decreased 6  in 2016  from 2015  

derivative financial instruments 

we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because we use derivative instruments volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives in 2016 2015 and 2014 we recognized unrealized net marktomarket gains losses on natural gas derivatives of 260 million  176 million  and 79 million  respectively which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 

derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks other major financial institutions or large energy companies and in most cases the use of international swaps and derivatives association isda master netting arrangements the isda agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for overthecounter otc derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk in part by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement 

the isda master netting arrangements to most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support thresholds in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position the revolving credit agreement at any time when it is secured provides a cross collateral feature for those of our derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to or affiliates of parties to the revolving credit agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives in the event the revolving credit agreement becomes unsecured separate collateral could be required in connection with such derivatives 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was zero  and 211 million  respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 1830 million mmbtus and 4315 million  mmbtus respectively at both december 31 2016  and 2015  we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts 

as of december 31 2015  the notional amount of our open foreign currency derivatives was €89 million  none  of these open foreign currency derivatives were designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes all of these foreign currency derivatives were settled in 2016

embedded derivative liability 

under the terms of our strategic venture with chs if our credit rating is reduced below certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies we are required to make a nonrefundable yearly payment of 5 million  to chs the payment would continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or february 1 2026 on february 1 2016 we recognized this term of the strategic venture as an embedded derivative and its value of 8 million  was included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet see note 17—noncontrolling interests  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information 

during 2016 we recorded adjustments to increase the value of the embedded derivative liability by 23 million  to reflect our credit evaluations the inputs into the fair value measurement include the probability of future upgrades and downgrades of our credit rating based on historical credit rating movements of other public companies and the discount rates to be applied to potential annual payments based on applicable credit spreads of other public companies at different credit rating levels based on these inputs our fair value measurement is classified as level 2 additionally as a result of the reduction in our credit rating in the fourth quarter of 2016 we made a 5 million  payment to chs the fair value of the embedded derivative liability as of december 31 2016 is 26 million  which is included in other liabilities and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet included in other operating—net in our consolidated statement of operations is a net loss of 23 million  

defined benefit pension plans 

we contributed 23 million to our pension plans in 2016  we expect to contribute approximately 22 million to our pension plans in 2017

cash flows 

operating activities 

year ended december 31 2016  compared to year ended december 31 2015   

net cash provided by operating activities  in 2016 was 617 million  as compared to 121 billion  in 2015 a decline of 590 million  the decline  resulted primarily from lower net earnings during 2016  due to lower selling prices from excess global nitrogen supply partially offset by lower amounts of cash used for working capital purposes lower working capital levels in accounts receivable and inventory plus lower amounts paid for income taxes and certain income tax refunds received in 2016 contributed to the reduction in cash used for working capital favorable changes in working capital also included a greater proportion of sales was paid in 2016 as compared to the prior year period as we entered 2016 with a lower level of customer advances than in 2015 due to customers’ hesitancy to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment 

year ended december 31 2015  compared to year ended december 31 2014   

net cash provided by operating activities  in 2015  was 121 billion  as compared to 142 billion  in 2014  the 214 million   decrease  was primarily due to unfavorable working capital changes as customer advances were lower and inventory levels were higher in 2015  as compared to 2014  levels due to the declining pricing environment for nitrogen fertilizers in 2015 customers delayed making forward purchase commitments to purchase fertilizer in 2015 which reduced the amount of customer advances that were received as compared to 2014 when fertilizer pricing was stronger a poor fall ammonia application season contributed to higher inventory levels in 2015 as compared to 2014 when inventory levels declined 

investing activities 

years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014   

net cash used in investing activities  was 218 billion  in 2016  compared to 298 billion  in 2015  this decrease is due primarily to the 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us for a net cash payment of 552 million which was net of cash acquired of 18 million this decrease was also attributable in part to a decline in capital expenditures related primarily to the capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa during 2016  capital expenditures totaled 221 billion  compared to 247 billion  in 2015  the 344 million  net cash used in investing activities in 2014  included 181 billion  in capital expenditures and 505 million  transferred to a restricted cash account in support of the capacity expansion projects partially offset by cash proceeds of 137 billion  from the sale of the phosphate business 

financing activities 

years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014   

net cash provided by financing activities was 244 billion  in 2016  compared to 77 million  in 2015  and net cash used in financing activities of 787 million   in 2014  in 2016  chs purchased a minority equity interest in cfn for  28 billion  we distributed 119 million to the noncontrolling interests including chs in 2016 compared to 45 million and 46 million in 2015  and 2014  respectively the increase in distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2014 was due to the chs strategic venture which increased the distributions by 79 million  representing the distributions paid to chs in the third quarter of 2016 for the distribution period ended june 30 2016 

 in 2016 we received proceeds of approximately 124 billion  net of discounts from the issuance of the senior secured notes which were used to fund the prepayment of the 10 billion  of private senior notes and the related makewhole payment of 170 million in both 2015  and 2014  we issued senior notes and received proceeds of approximately 10 billion and 15 billion respectively no share repurchases were made during 2016  compared to cash used for share repurchases in 2015  and 2014  of 556 million  and 194 billion  respectively

cf industries holdings inc 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer the rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one  to eleven years  and the barge charter commitments range from one  to seven years  we also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system some of which contain minimum throughput requirements the storage agreements contain minimum terms generally ranging from one  to five years  and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party see note 24—leases  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information concerning leases 

we do not have any other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap us gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciation and amortization are computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation and amortization expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews 

scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized in property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to five years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher depreciation and amortization costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line entitled additions to property plant and equipment 

cf industries holdings inc 

inventory valuation 

we review our inventory account balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine whether the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their market value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated market value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices are less than our most recent estimate of market value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation 

asset retirement obligations 

asset retirement obligations aros are legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value we have aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing complexes and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposal of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2016  dollars is 72 million  we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros as of december 31 2016  because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities or our distribution and storage facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each complex or facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities and our distribution and storage facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion 

recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating rates operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review 

the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value and the reduction in value is other than temporary the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earnings 

plnl is our joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the ngc pursuant to the ngc contract the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method the joint venture has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which have reduced the ammonia production at plnl in 2016 ngc communicated to plnl that it does not recognize the joint venture’s exercise of its option to renew the ngc contract for an additional fiveyear term beyond its current termination date in september 2018 and that any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2018 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price plnl has initiated arbitration proceedings against ngc and asserted claims in connection with ngc’s failure to supply the contracted quantities of natural gas and its refusal to recognize the joint venture’s exercise of its option to extend the ngc contract plnl is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages for past and ongoing curtailments although the joint venture believes its claims against ngc to be meritorious it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration there are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture that are uncertain at this time including the quantities of gas ngc will make available the cost of such gas the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing as part of our impairment assessment of our equity method investment in plnl we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized 

cf industries holdings inc 

a 134 million  impairment charge in 2016 previously in 2015 we recognized an impairment charge of 62 million  related to our equity method investment in plnl the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2016 is approximately 139 million  if ngc does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to plnl at prices that permit profitable operations plnl may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in plnl 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the ammonia granular urea uan an and other segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2016  2015  or 2014  reviews as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the carrying value of our goodwill was 235 billion  and 239 billion  respectively 

intangible assets identified in connection with our 2010 acquisition of terra industries inc consist of customer relationships which are being amortized over a period of 18 years the intangible assets identified in connection with our 2015 acquisition of cf fertilisers uk  consist of customer relationships and trade names which are being amortized over a remaining period of approximately 20  years our intangible assets are presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets see note 7—goodwill and other intangible assets  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets 

income taxes 

we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period in which these changes occur 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

a deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and joint venture that are considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income tax liability is recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and joint venture which we believe to be permanently reinvested 

as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and joint venture that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods 

we operate in a number of countries and as a result have a significant amount of cross border transactions the taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators in countries across the globe including the countries in which we operate the tax rules and regulations within the various countries in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various countries as a result there are instances 

cf industries holdings inc 

where regulators within the countries involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances we work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions however there are instances where reaching a common understanding is not possible or practical as of december 31 2016  we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits including penalties and interest of 162 million  which is related predominantly to certain potential tax exposures involving cross border transactions this amount represents our best estimate of the amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions differences in interpretation of the tax laws including agreements between governments surrounding our cross border transactions can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimates 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized key assumptions that affect our projected benefit obligation pbo are discount rates and in addition for our united kingdom plans an adjusted retail price index rpi key assumptions affecting pension expense include discount rates the expected longterm rate of return on assets eroa and in addition for our united kingdom plans rpi 

 the december 31 2016  pbo was computed based on a weightedaverage discount rate of 40  for our north america plans and 28  for our united kingdom plans which were based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo the weightedaverage discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2016  was 43  for north america plans and 38  for united kingdom plans our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 49  weightedaverage eroa used to calculate pension expense in 2016  for our north america plans is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods the 52  weightedaverage eroa used to calculate pension expense in 2016  for our united kingdom plans is based on expected longterm performance of underlying investments adjusted for investment managers fees the 33  rpi used to calculate our united kingdom plan pbo and the 31  rpi used to calculate 2016 pension expense is developed using the bank of england implied retail price inflation curve which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and indexlinked government bonds 

 for north america qualified pension plans our pbo was 759 million  as of december 31 2016  which was 123 million  higher than pension plan assets for our united kingdom pension plans our pbo was 559 million  as of december 31 2016  which was 193 million  higher than pension plan assets the tables below estimate the impact of a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the key assumptions on our december 31 2016  pbo and 2016  pension expense

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to nitrogenbased fertilizers are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea uan 32 and an by approximately 32 22 14 and 15 respectively 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily with the use of derivative financial instruments covering periods through december 2018 the derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options these derivatives settle using primarily nymex futures price indexes which represent the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had open derivative contracts for 1830 million  mmbtus and 4315 million  mmbtus respectively a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas as of december 31 2016  would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of 169 million  and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by 169 million  

from time to time we may purchase nitrogen products on the open market to augment or replace production at our facilities 

interest rates 

as of december 31 2016  we had eight series of senior notes totaling 585 billion  of principal outstanding with maturity dates of may 1 2018  may 1 2020  december 1 2021  june 1 2023 december 1 2026  march 15 2034  june 1 2043 and march 15 2044 the senior notes have fixed interest rates as of december 31 2016  the carrying value and fair value of our senior notes was approximately 578 billion  and 551 billion  respectively 

borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear current market rates of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings maximum borrowings during 2016  and 2015  were 150 million  and 367 million  respectively there were no  borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2016  or december 31 2015  

upon the termination of the combination agreement on may 22 2016 the lenders’ commitments under the bridge credit agreement terminated automatically there were no borrowings under the bridge credit agreement 

foreign currency exchange rates 

since the fourth quarter of 2012 we have entered into eurous dollar derivative hedging transactions related to the eurodenominated construction costs associated with our capacity expansion projects at our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa facilities as of december 31 2015  the notional amount of our open foreign currency forward contracts was €89 million  all of these foreign currency derivatives settled in 2016 

we are directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro outside of the transactions mentioned above we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies

 we are currently constructing new ammonia and uan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex in november 2015 the new urea plant at the donaldsonville louisiana complex came on line and was the first plant to be commissioned as part of our capacity expansion projects in north america see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda—liquidity and capital resources—capacity expansion projects and restricted cash for additional information related to our capacity expansion projects 

in the third quarter of 2015 we changed our reportable segment structure to separate an from our other segment as our an products increased in significance as a result of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition our reportable segment structure reflects how our chief operating decision maker codm as defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap assesses the performance of our operating segments and makes decisions about resource allocation our reportable segments now consist of ammonia granular urea uan an other and phosphate these segments are differentiated by products our management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources historical financial results have been restated to reflect the new reportable segment structure on a comparable basis see note 4—acquisitions and divestitures  for additional information 

on may 15 2015 we announced that our board of directors declared a fiveforone split of our common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend on june 17 2015 stockholders of record as of the close of business on june 1 2015 record date received four additional shares of common stock for each share of common stock held on the record date shares reserved under the companys equity and incentive plans were adjusted to reflect the stock split all share and per share data has been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split except for the number of authorized shares of common stock since the par value of the common stock remained at 001 per share the recorded value for common stock has been retroactively restated to reflect the par value of total outstanding shares with a corresponding decrease to paidin capital 

on march 17 2014 we sold our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was reported in our phosphate segment the phosphate segment reflects the reported results of the phosphate business through march 17 2014 plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after march 17 2014 the remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014 therefore the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter however the segment will continue to be included until the reporting of comparable period phosphate results ceases see note 4—acquisitions and divestitures  for additional information

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

we operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries were canceled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock 

in april 2010 we acquired terra industries inc terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities our 753 interest in tnclp and certain joint venture interests 

in march 2014 we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was located in florida to mosaic for approximately 14 billion in cash 

in july 2015 we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk  not previously owned by us for total consideration of 5704 million and cf fertilisers uk  became wholly owned by us 

product tons and nutrient tons 

unless otherwise stated we measure our production and sales volume in this annual report on form 10k in product tons which represents the weight of the product measured in short tons one short ton is equal to 2000 pounds references to uan product tons assume a 32 nitrogen content basis for production volume 

we also provide certain supplementary volume information measured in nutrient tons nutrient tons represent the weight of the product’s nitrogen content which varies by product ammonia represents 82 nitrogen content granular urea represents 46 nitrogen content uan represents between 28 and 32 nitrogen content and an represents between 29 and 35 nitrogen content 

reportable segments 

as discussed above our reportable segments now consist of the following segments ammonia granular urea uan an other and phosphate these segments are differentiated by products historical financial results have been restated to reflect this new reportable segment structure on a comparable basis see note 21—segment disclosures  for additional information 

we use gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources total other operating costs and expenses consisting of selling general and administrative expenses and other operating—net and nonoperating expenses interest and income taxes are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management 

cf industries holdings inc 

nitrogen product segments   

we are the largest nitrogen fertilizer producer in north america our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia granular urea uan and an our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products from our nitrogen product segments  are shown in the following table net sales do not reflect amounts used internally such as ammonia in the manufacture of other products 



 

 gross margin for the nitrogen product segments  was 155 billion  177 billion  and 245 billion  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

we operate seven nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in north america we own four nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in the united states one in medicine hat alberta canada and one in courtright ontario canada we also have a 753  interest in tnclp and its subsidiary tnlp which owns a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in verdigris oklahoma in 2015  the combined production capacity of these seven facilities represented approximately 37 34 45 and 21 of north american ammonia granular urea uan and an production capacity respectively each of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in north america has onsite storage to provide flexibility to manage the flow of outbound shipments without impacting production 

we also operate two united kingdom nitrogen manufacturing complexes located in ince and billingham that produce ammonia an and npks and serve primarily the british agricultural and industrial markets

cf industries holdings inc 

point lisas trinidad 

the point lisas nitrogen facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago is owned jointly through a 5050 venture with koch fertilizer llc this facility has the capacity to produce 720000 tons of ammonia annually from natural gas supplied under a contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago 

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in 2015  natural gas accounted for approximately 45  of our total production costs for nitrogen fertilizer products our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities have access to abundant competitivelypriced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities our facilities utilize the following natural gas hubs henry hub in louisiana oneok in oklahoma aeco in alberta ventura in iowa demarcation in kansas dawn in ontario and the national balancing point in the united kingdom 

our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consume in the aggregate approximately 280 million mmbtus of natural gas annually we employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced supply of natural gas we also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices for further information about our natural gas hedging activities see note 16—derivative financial instruments  

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the safe efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer products to terminals warehouses and customers each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location 

our north american nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the us and canada with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5600 tank and hopper cars as well as railcars provided by rail carriers our united kingdom nitrogen production facilities ship products via truck 

the north american waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our donaldsonville verdigris and yazoo city facilities we employ a fleet of twelve leased tow boats and 40 river barges to ship ammonia and uan we also utilize contract marine services to move urea fertilizer we also export nitrogen fertilizer products via barge from our billingham united kingdom manufacturing facility 

three of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia the donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2000mile long nustar pipeline through which we transport ammonia to more than 20 terminals and shipping points in the midwestern us corn belt our verdigris and port neal facilities are connected to the 1100mile long magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the us midwest 

phosphate segment 

the phosphate segment reflects the reported results of the phosphate business through march 17 2014 plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after march 17 2014 the remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014 therefore the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter although the segment will continue to be included until the reporting of comparable period phosphate results ceases 

upon selling the phosphate business we began to supply mosaic with ammonia produced by our plnl joint venture the contract to supply ammonia to mosaic from our plnl joint venture represents the continuation of a supply practice that previously existed between our former phosphate mining and manufacturing business and other operations of the company prior to march 17 2014 plnl sold ammonia to us for use in the phosphate business and the cost was included in our production costs in our phosphate segment subsequent to the sale of the phosphate business we now sell the plnlsourced ammonia to mosaic the revenue from these sales to mosaic and the costs to purchase the ammonia from plnl are now included in our ammonia segment our 50 share of the operating results of our plnl joint venture continues to be included in equity in earnings of operating affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations because of the significance of this continuing supply practice in accordance with us gaap the phosphate mining and manufacturing business is not reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for additional information regarding this sale see note 4—acquisitions and divestitures  

cf industries holdings inc 

our historical sales of phosphate fertilizer products are shown in the table below 



gross margin for the phosphate segment was 101 million  and 749 million for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

storage facilities and other properties 

as of december 31 2015  we owned or leased space at 88  inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 22state region of the united states canada and the united kingdom including storage at our production facilities we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately 33 million  tons of fertilizer our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table 



 

 customers 

the principal customers for our nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products are cooperatives independent fertilizer distributors farmers and industrial users none of our customers in 2015  accounted for more than ten percent of our consolidated net sales sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force 

competition 

our markets are global and intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium inc koch fertilizer llc and potash corporation of saskatchewan inc there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition from foreignsourced products continuously 

our primary united kingdom competition comes from imported products supplied by companies including yara international origin fertilisers bunn fertiliser limited koch ameropa chs and helm urea and uan are not produced in the united kingdom but along with an are widelytraded fertilizer products with limited barriers to entry 

cf industries holdings inc 

seasonality 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

financial information about foreign and domestic sales and operations 

the amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying value of our foreign and domestic longlived assets are set forth in note 21—segment disclosures

our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2015  totaled approximately 320 million in 2016  we estimate that we will spend approximately 430 million for environmental health and safety capital expenditures environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

clean air act—section 185 fee 

our donaldsonville nitrogen complex is located in a fiveparish region near baton rouge louisiana that as of 2005 was designated as being in severe nonattainment with respect to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone the 1hour ozone standard pursuant to the federal clean air act the act section 185 of the act requires states in their state implementation plans to levy a fee section 185 fee on major stationary sources such as the donaldsonville complex located in a severe nonattainment area that did not meet the 1hour ozone standard by november 30 2005 for additional information on the section 185 fee see note 20—contingencies

cerclaremediation matters 

from time to time we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws in 2011 we received a notice from the idaho department of environmental quality ideq that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho the current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site we and the current owner are currently conducting a remedial investigationfeasibility study of the site in 2015 we and several other parties received a notice that the us department of interior and other trustees intend to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for a group of former phosphate mines in southeast idaho including the former georgetown canyon mine for additional information on the cerclaremediation matters see note 20—contingencies  

regulation of greenhouse gases 

we are subject to regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states concerning greenhouse gas ghg emissions 

the united kingdom is a party to the kyoto protocol as a result of agreements reached during a conference in durban south africa in 2011 the kyoto protocol will continue in force for a second commitment period which will expire by 2020 on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15°c above preindustrial levels the paris agreement could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the united kingdom has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas trading system our uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require these plants to purchase co 2  emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our uk sites are also subject to the european union emissions trading scheme 

canada withdrew from further participation in the kyoto protocol in december 2011 but is a signatory to the paris agreement in canada we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canadas national pollutant release inventory and ontarios mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation ontario is party to the western climate initiative wci comprising california and several canadian provinces in april 2015 ontario announced that it intended to implement its own ghg cap and trade program on november 16 2015 ontario published a notice seeking comments on the design of its cap and trade system the notice stated that ontario was proposing to commence operation of the cap and trade program by january 1 2017 and that this program would link with the cap and trade programs already in operation in california and quebec the design document further proposed that the initial cap be set at forecasted ghg emissions for 2017 with annual reductions in the cap designed to achieve the objective of reducing ontarios ghg emissions to 15 below 1990 levels by 2020 

 in alberta the specified gas emitters regulation ghg regulation was implemented in 2007 this program requires facilities emitting more than 100000 tons of ghgs per year to reduce emissions by 12 over such facilities 2007 levels to meet this requirement companies can reduce emissions purchaseuse offset credits or contribute to a technology fund at an annual rate of 15 per ton of co 2  currently our medicine hat facility’s method of compliance is to make contributions to the technology fund alberta has recently announced that it is replacing its current approach with respect to carbon by introducing a carbon tax that applies across all sectors the carbon tax is set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2016 with an emissions reduction target of 15 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 with an emissions reduction target of 20 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafter 

the united states is not a party to the kyoto protocol but is a signatory to the paris agreement in the united states ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels although some of the more significant developments to date including epas clean power plan do not directly impose obligations on our facilities the epa has issued a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result are required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd construction permit applicable to such facilities we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to ghgs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects other than the states implementation of this permitting requirement none of the states where our 

cf industries holdings inc 

us production facilities are located—louisiana mississippi iowa and oklahoma—has proposed control regulations limiting ghg emissions 

new source performance standards for nitric acid plants 

we operate 13 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides no x  notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas 

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals more stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits the baton rouge area where our donaldsonville facility is located currently is classified as marginal nonattainment for ozone with respect to the ozone standard issued in 2008 epa has proposed reclassifying the baton rouge area as in attainment with the 2008 ozone standard based on 20122014 data however on october 26 2015 epa published a more stringent national ambient air quality standard for ozone that could cause baton rouge to again be classified as a nonattainment area such a classification in the baton rouge area or in other areas where our manufacturing facilities are located could result in more stringent air pollution emissions limits for our existing operations and would also subject our facilities to more stringent requirements to obtain approvals for plant expansions or could make it difficult to obtain such approvals 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we employed approximately 2800 fulltime and 100 parttime employees

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

any changes to the tax laws or relevant facts may jeopardize or delay the proposed combination with the ena business of oci 

each of our and oci’s respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement is subject to a condition that there shall have been no i change in law official interpretation thereof or officially proposed action by the us internal revenue service irs or the us department of the treasury other than those rules described in notice 201579 issued by the department of the treasury and irs on november 19 2015 whether or not yet approved or effective with respect to subject matters covered by code section 7874 or ii passage of any bill that would implement a change in applicable laws by either the us house of representatives or the us senate with respect to subject matters covered by code section 7874 that in either of case i or ii if finalized and made effective in the opinion of our legal counsel or oci’s legal counsel a would reasonably be expected to cause new cf to be treated as a us domestic corporation for us federal tax purposes or b would cause new cf to fail to qualify for relevant benefits of the usnetherlands tax treaty in addition our obligation to consummate the combination is subject to a condition that we shall have received from our legal counsel i an opinion dated as of the closing date to the effect that section 7874 of the code or any other us tax laws existing regulations promulgated thereunder and official interpretation thereof as set forth in published guidance should not apply in such a manner so as to cause new cf to be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes from and after the closing date and ii an opinion dated as of the closing date to the effect that new cf should qualify for relevant benefits of the usnetherlands tax treaty oci’s obligations to consummate the combination are subject to a condition that oci shall have received from oci’s legal counsel an opinion dated as of the closing date to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the separation should be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a1d and a distribution qualifying under section 355 of the code in the event that one or more of the above conditions are not satisfied the relevant party or if applicable each party will determine based on the facts and circumstances existing at the applicable time whether to invoke the applicable condition and not consummate the combination or waive the condition and consummate the combination assuming the other closing conditions are satisfied or waived accordingly any changes in applicable tax laws regulations or the underlying facts before the closing date could jeopardize or delay the combination andor have a material adverse effect on new cf’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor share price 

governmental or regulatory actions could delay the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement or result in the imposition of conditions that reduce the anticipated benefits from the combination or cause the parties to abandon the combination 

conditions to closing the proposed combination with the ena business of oci include clearance by the committee on foreign investment in the united states and that there is no judgment temporary restraining order preliminary or permanent injunction ruling determination decision opinion or comparable judicial or regulatory action of a governmental body in effect that prohibits the combination at any time before or after the completion of the merger and notwithstanding the termination of applicable waiting periods the antitrust division and the ftc or any state attorney general could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties in addition in some circumstances a third party could initiate a private action under antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the combination before or after it is completed we and oci may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust and competition laws we have agreed to pay oci 150 million if the combination agreement is terminated in certain circumstances if certain regulatory approvals are not obtained 

we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed combination with the ena business of oci is pending which could adversely affect our business and operations 

in connection with the pending combination with the ena business of oci it is possible that some customers suppliers and other persons with whom we have business relationships may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate change or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the combination which could negatively affect our revenues and earnings as well as the market price of our common stock regardless of whether the combination is completed 

cf industries holdings inc 

under the terms of the combination agreement we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the closing which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies these restrictions the waiver of which is subject to the consent of oci not to be unreasonably withheld could prevent us from taking certain actions that may be beneficial to our business such as making acquisitions pursuing certain business opportunities or entering into certain financing instruments such limitations could negatively affect our operations and business prior to the closing 

furthermore the process of planning to integrate two businesses and organizations for the postcombination period can divert management attention and resources and could ultimately have an adverse effect on us 

the combination agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternative transactions to the combination could discourage potential alternative transactions andor third parties from making alternative transaction proposals and could require in certain circumstances that we pay a termination fee of 150 million 

pursuant to the terms of the combination agreement we may be required to pay a termination fee of 150 million if the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement are not consummated because of the occurrence of certain events including a change to the recommendation of our board of directors with respect to the proposals related to the combination that are to be voted on by our stockholders such a fee could be payable even if no other alternative transaction is consummated in addition if the combination agreement is terminated because we fail to obtain the required approval of our stockholders we are obligated to reimburse oci’s expenses up to a cap of 30 million 

we are generally prohibited from entering into an acquisition agreement with a third party soliciting an alternative proposal from any third party involving 15 or more of our common stock assets or earning power and subject to limited exceptions participating in any discussions or negotiations regarding any proposal that is or could reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative acquisition proposal or furnishing any nonpublic information in connection therewith in addition under the terms of the combination agreement we are not permitted to terminate the combination agreement if our board of directors withdraws its recommendation of the combination agreement or approves or recommends an alternative acquisition proposal and must continue in these circumstances to submit the combination agreement for consideration by our stockholders unless oci terminates the combination agreement 

the presence of the above provisions and the termination fee could discourage third parties from making alternative acquisition proposals even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the proposed market value of the shares in the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement as a result third parties may make acquisition proposals if at all at a lower price than they would otherwise be willing to make in the absence of such restrictions on the ability of our board of directors to consider andor negotiate with respect to such proposals we may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to a more favorable alternative transaction without incurring significant liability 

failure to complete the proposed combination with the ena business of oci or significant delays in completing the combination could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock andor our future business and financial results 

the consummation of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci is subject to numerous conditions which may not be satisfied in a timely manner or at all if the combination is not completed or if there are significant delays in completing the combination the trading price of our common stock andor our future business and financial results could be negatively affected and we will be subject to various risks including the following

cf industries holdings inc 

we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci 

we could experience difficulty in attracting motivating and retaining executives and other employees due to the uncertainty of the closing of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci in addition certain key employees of the ena business may not wish to become employees of new cf until completion of the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement employee retention could be a challenge for us as employees may have uncertainty about the combination and their future roles with new cf if our employees or employees of the ena business depart prior to the closing of the combination due to uncertainty or the difficulty of integrating the two businesses new cfs ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement could be reduced or delayed 

we are subject to risk associated with the chs strategic venture 

we may not realize the full benefits from the chs strategic venture that are expected the realization of the expected benefits of the chs strategic venture depends on our ability to successfully operate and manage the strategic venture and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with chs over the life of the agreement among other factors additionally any challenges related to the chs strategic venture could harm our relationships with our customers employees or suppliers 

our business is dependent on natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products 

because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2015  the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 154  per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 330  per mmbtu on january 16 2015  during the three year period ended december 31 2015  the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 154  per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 794  per mmbtu on march 5 2014  

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2015  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 460  per mmbtu on december 23 2015  and december 24 2015  and a high of 850  per mmbtu on february 12 2015  during the three year period ended december 31 2015  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 460  per mmbtu on december 23 2015  and december 24 2015  and a high of 1600  per mmbtu on march 22 2013  

changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas additionally increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production or increased demand were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states or elsewhere natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cf industries holdings inc 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply demand balance 

periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacity 

during periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities 

consolidation in the industry has increased the resources of several of our competitors some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships 

china the worlds largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capacity in the medium term if chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our competitors in russia and ukraine have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity and continue to benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas which allows them to increase exports at aggressive prices depending on market conditions most us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia and ukraine will be under review by government agencies in the coming year and any revocation of such measures could lead to significant increases in imports from these countries 

we also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe and latin america who depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products 

conditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results our operating results are also affected by conditions in the european agricultural industry the agricultural industries in the united states and europe can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control 

governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that 

cf industries holdings inc 

have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand 

developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including any limitation on the use and application of chemical fertilizer could affect the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations and those of our joint venture are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and any delay or interruption in the delivery may adversely affect our business 

we and our joint venture use natural gas and other raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase the natural gas and other raw materials from third party suppliers our natural gas is transported by pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint venture by third party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties delays or interruptions in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials may be caused by among other things severe weather or natural disasters unscheduled downtime labor difficulties insolvency of our suppliers or their inability to meet existing contractual arrangements deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents or mechanical failures in addition the transport of natural gas by pipeline is subject to additional risks including delays or interruptions caused by capacity constraints leaks or ruptures any delay or interruption in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials even for a limited period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers and are subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight this exposes us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to additional liability 

we rely on railroad truck pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and operating hazards additionally due to the aging infrastructure of certain bridges roadways rail lines river locks and equipment that our third party service providers utilize we may experience delays in both the receipt of raw materials or the shipment of finished product while repairs maintenance or replacement activities are conducted also certain third party service providers particularly railroads have experienced periodic service slowdowns due to capacity constraints in their systems which impact the shipping times of our products 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents discharges or other releases of hazardous substances terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives governmental entities could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products 

if shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the united states and canada the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads have implemented tariffs that include provisions that purport to shift liability to shippers to the extent that liabilities arise from third parties with insufficient resources these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products increases in transportation costs or changes in such costs 

cf industries holdings inc 

relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors and any railroad industry initiatives that may impact our ability to transport our products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacture transportation storage and distribution of chemical products including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled plant downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage there can be no assurance that we will be able to buy and maintain insurance with adequate limits and reasonable pricing terms and conditions 

in april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities have been named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases have been consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption “in re west explosion cases” the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325 individuals and 80 insurance companies plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident the court granted in part and denied in part the cf entities motions for summary judgment in august 2015 thirtyfour cases including the three cases scheduled to begin trial on october 12 2015 and some of the ten cases scheduled to begin trial on february 1 2016 were resolved pursuant to confidential settlements fully funded by insurance the remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pretrial proceedings these cases will be set for trial in the upcoming months at the discretion of the court we believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the cf entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits the increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilities 

cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results 

we rely on information technology and computer control systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications the management of our accounting financial and supply chain functions and plant operations business and supply chain disruptions plant and utility outages and information technology system and network disruptions due to cyber attacks could seriously harm our operations and materially adversely affect our operating results cyber security risks include attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers damage or loss of information due to viruses the unintended disclosure of confidential information the misuse or loss of control over computer control systems and breaches due to employee error our exposure to cyber security risks includes exposure through third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our systems and information from being vulnerable to cyber attacks we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate prevent or recover from rapidly evolving 

cf industries holdings inc 

types of cyber attacks compromises to our information and control systems could have severe financial and other business implications 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations 

weather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freezeoffs or hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise 

we may not be able to complete our capacity expansion projects on schedule as planned on budget or at all due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

we are constructing new ammonia and ureauan plants at our complex in donaldsonville louisiana and new ammonia and urea plants at our complex in port neal iowa a portion of these multibillion dollar projects was completed in late 2015 and the remaining projects are scheduled for completion at various times in 2016 

the design development construction and startup of the new plants are subject to a number of risks any of which could prevent us from completing the projects on schedule as planned and on budget or at all including cost overruns performance of third parties the inability to obtain necessary permits or to obtain such permits without undue delay inability to comply with permit terms and conditions adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor and raw material shortages transportation constraints engineering and construction change orders errors in the design construction or startup and other unforeseen difficulties 

the donaldsonville and port neal capacity expansion projects are dependent on the availability and performance of the engineering firms construction firms equipment suppliers transportation providers and other vendors necessary to design and build the new units on a timely basis and on acceptable economic terms if any of the third parties fails to perform as we expect our ability to meet our expansion goals would be affected 

our expansion plans may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences such as the diversion of managements attention from our existing plants and businesses and other opportunities 

we may not be successful in the expansion of our business 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both within the united states and elsewhere major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments require significant managerial resources the diversion of which from our other activities may impair the operation of our business we may be unable to identify or successfully compete for certain acquisition targets which may hinder or prevent us from acquiring a target or completing other transactions the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or business combination transactions are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments  among the risks associated with the pursuit and consummation of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments or business combination transactions are those involving

international acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination or investments and other international expansions of our business involve additional risks and uncertainties including 

 

if we finance acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints under the terms of and as a result of the repayment and debtservice obligations under the additional indebtedness a business combination transaction between us and another company could result in our stockholders receiving cash or shares of another entity on terms that such stockholders may not consider desirable moreover the regulatory approvals associated with a business combination may result in divestitures or other changes to our business the effects of which are difficult to predict 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws regulations and permitting requirements as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the rcra the cercla the tsca and various other federal state and local laws 

as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current facilities or facilities previously owned by us or other acquired businesses adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be 

cf industries holdings inc 

material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental health and safety laws and regulations we may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental health and safety laws in the future additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures we sell among other products def which is subject to epa emissions standards that may become more stringent in the future our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion or modification of our operations is predicated upon securing necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval or a determination that we have violated a law or permit as a result of a governmental inspection of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at our facilities and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows on october 1 2015 the epa released a final regulation lowering the national ambient air quality standard for ozone this action is expected to result in additional areas of the country being classified as being in nonattainment with the ozone standard and subject to more stringent permitting requirements which in turn could make it much more difficult and expensive to obtain permits to construct new facilities or expand our existing operations 

future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states in the united states our existing facilities currently are only subject to ghg emissions reporting obligations although our new and modified facilities are likely to be subject to ghg emissions standards included in their air permits our facilities in the united kingdom are subject to regulatory emissions trading systems which generally require us to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset ghg emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program our facility in alberta canada is subject to a provincial regulation requiring reductions in the facilitys net emissions intensity which can be met by facility improvements the purchase of emissions offsets or performance credits or contributions to a nonprofit climate change fund established by alberta alberta has recently announced that it is replacing its current approach with respect to carbon by introducing a carbon tax that applies across all sectors the carbon tax will be set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2018 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafter in april 2015 the province of ontario canada announced that it intends to implement a ghg cap and trade program in november 2015 ontario published a notice seeking comments on the design of its cap and trade system which notice indicated that ontario intended to commence operation of the cap and trade program effective january 1 2017 there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states canada or the united kingdom our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us

our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season 

if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from us 

a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assets 

any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months 

we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses 

we often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased fertilizers we have used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts 

our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidity 

hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks 

cf industries holdings inc 

major financial institutions or large energy companies we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments 

we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities 

our nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in nine separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which currently represents approximately 35 of our ammonia production capacity and will represent approximately 40 of our ammonia production capacity after the donaldsonville and port neal capacity expansion projects are fully operational the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane activity and our other complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas in the respective regions moreover our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace and could result in operational disruptions 

we are exposed to risks associated with our joint venture 

as of december 31 2015 our remaining joint venture is a 50 ownership interest in plnl which owns a facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago our joint venture partner shares a measure of control over the operations of our plnl joint venture as a result our investment in our plnl joint venture involves risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our plnl joint venture or our partner have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to or have veto rights over our instructions requests policies or objectives subject our plnl joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business 

in addition we may become involved in disputes with our plnl joint venture partner which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

our plnl joint venture operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments due to major maintenance activities being conducted at upstream natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in trinidad these curtailments have continued into 2015 and we are unable to predict when the curtailments will cease to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a 619 million  impairment of our equity method investment in plnl as we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded its fair value primarily due to the ongoing natural gas curtailments and the expectation that these curtailments will continue into the future in addition failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture which could result in further impairment to the value of the joint venture and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives we are subject to various security laws and regulations in the united states these security laws include the maritime transportation security act of 2002   and the chemical facilities antiterrorism standards regulation in addition president obama issued executive order 13650 improving chemical facility safety and security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or 

cf industries holdings inc 

limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives it is possible that governmental entities in the united states or elsewhere could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for us 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations 

our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions 

our principal reporting currency is the us dollar and our business operations and investments outside the united states increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the canadian dollar british pound and the euro we may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by among other things requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in or indexed to the us dollar or a currency freely convertible into us dollars or hedging through foreign currency derivatives these efforts however may not be effective and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs in various jurisdictions including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 and economic sanctions programs administered by the united nations the european union and the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury and regulations set forth under the comprehensive iran accountability divestment act as a result of doing business internationally we are exposed to a risk of violating anticorruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we our partners or agents operate violations of anticorruption and sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and termination of existing contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment the violation of applicable laws by our employees consultants agents or partners could subject us to penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation administration and enforcement will change over time changes in antitrust laws globally or in their interpretation administration or enforcement may limit our existing or future operations and growth 

our investments in securities are subject to risks that may result in losses 

we generally invest cash and cash equivalents from our operations in what we believe to be relatively shortterm highly liquid and high credit quality instruments including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental entities include those issued directly by the united states government those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities our investments are subject to fluctuations in both market value and yield based upon changes in market conditions including interest rates liquidity general economic and credit market conditions and conditions specific to the issuers 

due to the risks of investments we may not achieve expected returns or may realize losses on our investments which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories the overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted 

cf industries holdings inc 

in addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizers significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen fertilizers into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate that affect foreign trade and investment 

we have a material amount of indebtedness expect to have a substantial amount of indebtedness on a consolidated basis following consummation of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci and may need to incur additional indebtedness or need to refinance existing indebtedness in the future which may adversely affect our business 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 56 billion  of total funded indebtedness consisting primarily of senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2018  and 2044  we had excess borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit agreement of 19951 million  in addition upon the consummation of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci we expect to have a substantial amount of indebtedness on a consolidated basis we expect that this indebtedness will include our existing indebtedness approximately 12 billion of existing secured project finance indebtedness relating to the ena business and indebtedness under any of the existing oci convertible bonds assumed by us in connection with the combination in addition to fund the cash requirements in connection with the consummation of the combination we expect that we or our subsidiaries will use either cash on hand or a combination of cash on hand and cash proceeds from external sources whether using alternative financing arranged prior to the closing under the combination agreement or if such financing is not arranged a portion of the financing under our bridge credit agreement of approximately 10 billion in addition upon the consummation of the combination our bridge credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to 13 billion for general corporate purposes and our existing revolving credit agreement provides for up to 20 billion of borrowings for general corporate purposes 

our substantial debt service obligations could have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows our substantial indebtedness could as a result of our debt service obligation or through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it could 

 we expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we expect that the terms of our indebtedness will allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future if we incur additional indebtedness the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could intensify if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate our relations with our creditors including the holders of our outstanding debt securities the lenders under our revolving credit agreement and our bridge credit agreement and our suppliers may be materially and adversely affected

in the third quarter of 2015 we changed our reportable segment structure to separate an from our other segment as our an products increased in significance as a result of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition our new reportable segment structure reflects how our chief operating decision maker codm as defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap assesses the performance of our reportable segments and makes decisions about resource allocation our reportable segments now consist of ammonia granular urea uan an other and phosphate these segments are differentiated by products our management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources historical financial results have been restated to reflect the new reportable segment structure on a comparable basis 

a description of our reportable segments is included in the discussion of the operating results by business segment later in this discussion and analysis 

fiveforone common stock split 

on may 15 2015 we announced that our board of directors declared a fiveforone split of our common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend on june 17 2015 stockholders of record as of the close of business on june 1 2015 record date received four additional shares of common stock for each share of common stock held on the record date shares reserved under the companys equity and incentive plans were adjusted to reflect the stock split all share and per share data has been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split except for the number of authorized shares of common stock since the par value of the common stock remained at 001 per share the recorded value for common stock has been retroactively restated to reflect the par value of total outstanding shares with a corresponding decrease to paidin capital

transaction costs 

as more fully described below in the section titled strategic initiatives in 2015  we incurred 569 million  of transaction costs attributable to various consulting and legal services associated primarily with executing the strategic agreements and preparing for the proposed combination with the ena business of oci our strategic venture with chs and our acquisition of the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk  not previously owned by us 

phosphate business disposition 

on march 17 2014 we sold our phosphate mining and manufacturing business and recognized pretax and aftertax gains on the sale of the phosphate business of 7501 million and 4628 million respectively under the terms of the definitive transaction agreement the accounts receivable and accounts payable pertaining to the phosphate mining and manufacturing business and certain phosphate inventory held in distribution facilities were not sold to mosaic in the transaction and were settled in the ordinary course 

upon selling the phosphate business we began to supply mosaic with ammonia produced by our plnl joint venture the contract to supply ammonia to mosaic from our plnl joint venture represents the continuation of a supply practice that previously existed between our former phosphate mining and manufacturing business and other operations of the company prior to march 17 2014 plnl sold ammonia to us for use in the phosphate business and the cost was included in our production costs in our phosphate segment subsequent to the sale of the phosphate business we now sell the plnlsourced ammonia to mosaic the revenue from these sales to mosaic and the costs to purchase the ammonia from plnl are now included in our ammonia segment our 50 share of the operating results of our plnl joint venture continues to be included in our equity in earnings of operating affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations because of the significance of this continuing supply practice in accordance with us gaap the phosphate mining and manufacturing business is not reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 

the phosphate segment reflects the reported results of the phosphate business through march 17 2014 plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after march 17 2014 the remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014 therefore the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter however the segment will continue to be included until the reporting of comparable period phosphate results ceases 

impairment of our investment in plnl 

in 2015 our equity in earnings of operating affiliates includes a 619 million  impairment of our equity method investment in plnl in the fourth quarter of 2015 we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded its fair value this was primarily due to the ongoing natural gas curtailments impacting the results of operations of plnl and the expectation that these curtailments will continue into the future our plnl joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments in 2015 and 2014 due to major maintenance activities being conducted at upstream natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in the republic of trinidad and tobago commitments from ngc regarding the level of future availability and the related cost are not available the future availability and cost of natural gas represents a significant assumption in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing no impairment was recognized in 2014  or 2013  related to this investment 

cfl selling price modifications 

prior to april 30 2013 cf industries owned 49 of the voting common shares and 66 of the nonvoting preferred shares of canadian fertilizers limited cfl an alberta canada based nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer and had the right to purchase 66 of the production of cfl also prior to april 30 2013 viterra inc viterra held 34 of the equity ownership of cfl and had the right to purchase up to the remaining 34 of cfls production both cf industries and viterra were entitled to receive distributions of net earnings of cfl based upon their respective purchases from cfl cfl was a variable interest entity that was consolidated in our financial statements on april 30 2013 cf industries completed the acquisitions of all of the outstanding interests in cfl that it did not already own and cfl became our whollyowned subsidiary once cfl became a whollyowned subsidiary cf industries began purchasing all of the output of cfl for resale and reported those sales in its consolidated financial statements at market prices 

cf industries and viterras purchases of nitrogen fertilizer products from cfl were made under product purchase agreements and the selling prices were determined under the provisions of these agreements until april 30 2013 when cfl became a whollyowned subsidiary in our consolidated financial statements net sales and accounts receivable attributable to 

cf industries holdings inc 

cfl were solely generated by transactions with viterra as all transactions with cf industries were eliminated in consolidation in our financial statements 

the following summarizes the selling prices in the product purchase agreements that impacted the companys results due to sales transactions to viterra both before and after the effective date of the amendment 

 as a result the consolidated financial results for both 2015 and 2014 included a full year of marketbased selling prices while 2013 included four months of selling prices based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin and eight months of marketbased selling prices these changes affect the yearoveryear comparability of net sales gross margin operating earnings earnings before income taxes and net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest of 2013 as compared to 2014 and 2015 however these changes do not impact the comparability of our net earnings attributable to common stockholders or net cash flows for the same period 

in order to provide comparable information for the periods presented certain financial information is being provided for the 2013 comparable period adjusted as if twelve months of marketbased selling prices had been used in the 2013 comparable period 

we report our consolidated financial results in accordance with us gaap management believes that the presentation in this report of nongaap financial measures of certain adjusted data and the periodtoperiod percentage changes in such measures provides investors with additional meaningful information to assess periodtoperiod changes in our underlying operating performance this information includes consolidated net sales gross margin net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest in addition to segment net sales gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales and average selling prices per ton of ammonia and granular urea presented on an as adjusted basis as if all cfl sales to the noncontrolling interest had been priced based on marketbased selling prices for the twelve months of 2013 these nongaap financial measures are provided only for the purpose of facilitating comparisons between the periods operating performance and do not purport to represent what our actual consolidated results of operations would have been nor are they necessarily indicative of our future consolidated results of operations nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with us gaap 

net operating loss nol settlement 

at the time of our initial public offering ipo in 2005 we had accumulated a substantial amount of nols due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefit from the nols when we ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for income tax purposes and became a public company a full valuation allowance was recorded against the benefit of those nols at that time we entered into an agreement nol agreement with the preipo owners under which they would benefit should any of the preipo nols be realized in future years by using the nols to offset postipo taxable income if this were to occur we would pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved as of december 31 2012 the nols had a potential tax benefit of 943 million which had been fully reserved by the valuation allowance 

in january 2013 we and the preipo owners amended the nol agreement to provide among other things that we would be entitled to retain 269 of any settlement realized and 731 would be payable to them 

in march 2013 we entered into a closing agreement with the internal revenue service irs to resolve the tax treatment of the preipo nols pursuant to the closing agreement we agreed with the irs that we will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to a portion of the nols over five years commencing with the 2012 tax year the 206 million net benefit from this nol settlement was recognized in the first quarter of 2013 as follows

strategic initiatives 

agreement to combine with certain of oci nv’s businesses 

on august 6 2015 we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement as amended the combination agreement under which we will combine with the european north american and global distribution businesses collectively the ena business of oci oci is a global producer and distributor of natural gasbased fertilizers and industrial chemicals based in the netherlands the combination transaction includes oci’s nitrogen production facility in geleen netherlands its nitrogen production facility under construction in wever iowa its approximately 7988 equity interest in an ammonia and methanol complex in beaumont texas and its global distribution business and the assumption of approximately 2 billion in net debt the combination transaction also includes the purchase by cf holdings or its designee of a 45 interest plus an option to acquire the remaining interest in oci’s natgasoline project in texas which upon completion in 2017 will be one of the world’s largest methanol facilities

capacity expansion projects 

in 2012 we announced that we would construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex these new plants will increase our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville improve our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location and allow us to benefit from the cost advantages of north american natural gas in combination these new facilities will be able to produce 21 million  tons of gross ammonia per year upgraded products ranging from 20 million to 27 million tons of granular urea per year and up to 18 million tons of uan 32 solution per year depending on our choice of product mix 

cf industries holdings inc 

in november 2015 the new urea plant at the donaldsonville louisiana complex came on line and was the first plant to be commissioned as part of our capacity expansion projects the new uan plant at donaldsonville is expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2016 the remaining plants are expected to be commissioned in mid2016

key industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply  demand 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption governmental regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key exportingconsuming countries such as china india and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal supply costs are affected by the supply availability and demand for these commodities 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america declined over the past several years but are subject to volatility during the three year period ended december 31 2015  the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 154  per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 794  per mmbtu on march 5 2014  

we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2015  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 460  per mmbtu on december 23 2015  and december 24 2015 and a high of 850  per mmbtu on february 12 2015  during the three year period ended december 31 2015  the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 460  per mmbtu on both december 23 2015  and december 24 2015 and a high of 1600  per mmbtu on march 22 2013  

natural gas costs including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives declined   28  in 2015  from 2014  expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs for example natural gas costs including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 45  of our nitrogen product segments total production costs in 2015  

farmers economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns crop prices and the types of crops planted 

cf industries holdings inc 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental trade policies the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america including our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east ukraine the republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa russia and china are major exporters to north america 

government policies 

the policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports the subsidization of natural gas prices and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers farmers and imported or exported product due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by political and social objectives 

ethanol industry and the renewable fuel standard 

corn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 38 of total us corn demand us government policy as expressed in the renewable fuel standard rfs is a major determinant for the ethanol market the rfs establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels including ethanol that must be included in the united states’ supply of fuel for transportation in addition congress at various times has proposed legislation to either reduce or eliminate the rfs while past legislation proposing changes to the rfs has not passed there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be passed into law other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol gasoline and corn lower gasoline prices may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry 

factors affecting our results 

net sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we often use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing costs for nitrogenbased fertilizer we report our natural gas derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward sales and customer advances later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment volatility in quarterly reported earnings also may arise from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of derivatives 

selling general and administrative expenses our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees including those for corporate initiatives 

cf industries holdings inc 

transaction costs transaction costs consist of various consulting and legal services associated primarily with executing the strategic agreements and preparing for the proposed combination with the ena business of oci our strategic venture with chs and our acquisition of the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us 

other operating—net other operating—net includes administrative costs associated with our capacity expansion projects and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations costs included in other costs can include foreign exchange gains and losses unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives costs associated with our closed facilities amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates equity in earnings of operating affiliates consists of our 50  ownership interest in plnl we include our share of the net earnings from our investment in plnl as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities in the nitrogen product segments our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recognized a 619 million  impairment of our equity method investment in plnl 

interest expense our interest expense includes the interest on our longterm debt amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements and annual fees pursuant to our revolving credit agreement capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the facility along with all other construction costs 

interest income our interest income represents amounts earned on our cash cash equivalents investments and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 

income tax provision our income tax provision includes all currently payable and deferred united states and foreign income tax expense applicable to our ongoing operations 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the entities that we account for using the equity method and exclude from operating earnings income taxes related to these investments if any are reflected in this line the amounts recorded as equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes relate to our investments in cf fertilisers uk  and keytrade during the second quarter of 2015 we sold our interests in keytrade on july 31 2015 we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk  not previously owned by us for total consideration of 5704 million and recognized a 944 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk cf fertilisers uk  became wholly owned by us and beginning july 31 2015 the operating results of cf fertilisers uk  became part of our consolidated financial results 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest include the net earnings attributable to the 247  interest of the publiclyheld common units of tnclp net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest for the first four months of 2013 also included the interest of the 34 holder of cfls equity ownership on april 30 2013 we purchased the noncontrolling interests of cfl 

we own an aggregate 753  of tnclp and outside investors own the remaining 247  the tnclp agreement of limited partnership allows the general partner to receive incentive distribution rights once a minimum distribution threshold has been met partnership interests in tnclp are traded on the nyse and tnclp is separately registered with the sec

impact of cfl selling price modifications 

as discussed in the items affecting comparability of results section of this discussion and analysis on april 30 2013 cf industries acquired the noncontrolling interests in cfl and cfl became a whollyowned subsidiary of cf industries as a result the consolidated financial results for 2015 and 2014 included twelve months of marketbased selling prices while 2013 included four months of selling prices based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin and eight months of marketbased selling prices these changes affect the yearoveryear comparability of net sales gross margin operating earnings earnings before income taxes and net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest but do not impact the comparability of our net earnings attributable to common stockholders or net cash flows for the same period 

the following table adjusts the results for 2013 to marketbased selling prices for the full year to be on a comparable basis with 2015 and 2014

consolidated operating results 

our reportable segments consist of ammonia granular urea uan an other and phosphate and include the results of cf fertilisers uk  as a result of our acquisition that closed on july 31 2015 the ammonia granular urea uan an and other segments are referred to in this discussion and analysis as the “ nitrogen product segments ” 

our total gross margin declined  by 2314 million  or 13  to 155 billion  in 2015  from 178 billion  in 2014  the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition increased gross margin by 235 million  the remaining decline  in our gross margin of 2549 million  or 14  was due to the 2448 million   decrease  in gross margin in the nitrogen product segments  and the 101 million  decline in gross margin in the phosphate segment as the phosphate business was sold in the first quarter of 2014 the remaining decrease  in nitrogen product segments  gross margin as more fully described below was due primarily to lower average selling prices lower sales volume and the impact of marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives partially offset by lower physical natural gas costs

cf industries holdings inc 

 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 6999 million  for 2015  included a 944 million  gain as a result of the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk   944 million  after tax a 619 million   impairment of our equity method investment in plnl   619 million  after tax a 1763 million  unrealized net marktomarket loss   1109 million  after tax on natural gas derivatives 428 million  of losses  309 million  after tax as a result of the sale of equity method investments 569 million  of transaction costs  569 million  after tax 513 million  of expenses   323 million  after tax related to our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa that did not qualify for capitalization and 216 million  of realized and unrealized loss es  136 million  after tax on foreign currency derivatives related to our capacity expansion projects net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 139 billion  in 2014  included a 7501 million  gain  4628 million  after tax on sale of the phosphate business a 795 million  unrealized net marktomarket loss   501 million  after tax on natural gas derivatives 307 million  of expenses  194 million  after tax related to our capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization 384 million   242 million  after tax of realized and unrealized net losses on foreign currency derivatives and 131 million 82 million after tax of retirement benefits settlement charges 

net sales 

our total net sales decreased   4349 million  or 9  to 431 billion  in 2015  compared to 474 billion  in 2014  the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition increased our net sales by 2084 million  the remaining decline  in our net sales of 6433 million  or 14  included a 4749 million   decrease  attributable to the nitrogen product segments and a 1684 million   decrease  due to the sale of the phosphate business in march 2014 the remaining nitrogen product segments net sales decrease d due to an 8   decline  in average selling prices and a 3   decline  in sales volume 

nitrogen product segments average selling prices excluding the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition were 318  per ton in 2015  compared to 345  per ton in 2014  due primarily to lower uan granular urea and ammonia selling prices in 2015 as international nitrogen fertilizer prices continued to decline due to excess global supply the combination of falling global production costs foreign currency devaluation and reduced ocean freight costs allowed many international producers to continue operations and the resulting supply weighed on global prices the decline in uan average selling prices was primarily due to excess global supply granular urea exports from china were at a record high in 2015 and russian exports have increased significantly while global capacity additions in 2015 further contributed to the global supply excess and the decline in average selling prices compared to 2014 the decrease  in ammonia average selling prices from prior year levels is due primarily to weaker nitrogen fertilizer market conditions compared to the prior year as a weak fall application season combined with higher producer inventory levels and slowing demand from phosphate fertilizer producers weighed on prices at the end of 2015 

our total nitrogen product segments sales volume increased by 3 the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition increased our sales volume by 6 the remaining decline in our nitrogen product segments sales volume of 3 was due primarily to lower ammonia and uan sales volume our ammonia sales volume was lower in 2015 partly due to a poor fall application season in north america as a result of poor weather conditions in the midwest the season started late and ended early in november due to snow in the midwest in addition our ammonia and uan sales volume were lower as customers were hesitant to buy in a declining pricing environment 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales decreased   2035 million  or 7  from 2014  to 2015  including the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition which increased cost of sales by 1849 million  or 6  the remaining decrease  in our cost of sales of 3884 million  or 13  was due primarily to lower natural gas costs the cost of sales per ton in our nitrogen product segments averaged 200  in 2015  a 5   decrease  from the 211  per ton in 2014  the realized natural gas costs including the impact of lower purchased natural gas costs and realized derivative losses during 2015  decreased   28  compared to 2014  cost of sales in 2015  also included 1763 million  of unrealized net marktomarket loss es on natural gas derivatives compared to loss es of 795 million  in 2014  lower gas costs were primarily driven by increasing north american natural gas production as increased well efficiencies increased supply warm weather conditions especially in the fourth quarter also contributed to the high storage levels and the resulting decline in gas prices 

cf industries holdings inc 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increase d 179 million  to 1698 million  in 2015  from 1519 million  in 2014  the increase  was due primarily to the impact of the cf fertilisers uk  acquisition an increase in corporate project activities and higher intangible amortization costs 

transaction costs

other operating—net changed by 390 million  from 533 million  of expense  in 2014  to expense  of 923 million  in 2015  the increase d expense was due primarily to higher expansion project costs pertaining to our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization this was partially offset by the decrease  in realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency derivatives from 384 million  of loss es in 2014  to 216 million  of loss es in 2015  

equity in earnings of operating affiliates 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates  consists of our 50 share of the operating results of plnl equity in earnings of operating affiliates  decreased by 781 million  in 2015  as compared to 2014  due primarily to a 619 million  impairment of our equity method investment in plnl that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015 the remaining decrease  was due primarily to lower operating results from plnl due to lower average selling prices 

interest—net 

net interest expense was 1316 million  in 2015  compared to 1773 million  in 2014  the 457 million   decrease  in net interest expense was due primarily to higher amounts of capitalized interest related to our capacity expansion projects partially offset by higher interest expense pertaining to the 10 billion and 15 billion of senior notes issued in september 2015 and in march 2014 respectively we recorded capitalized interest of 1545 million  in 2015  primarily related to our capacity expansion projects compared to 742 million  in 2014

nitrogen product segments  net sales decrease d 1030 million  or 2  due primarily to a 4   decrease  in average selling prices partially offset by a 3   increase  in sales volume nitrogen product segments average selling prices decline d due primarily to lower ammonia and uan selling prices compared to the prior year period ammonia prices were lower due primarily to the higher producer inventory levels that carried over from the end of 2013 as compared to the previous year as a result of the shortened 2013 fall ammonia application season caused by cold weather conditions the decline in uan prices was due primarily to customer preferences for attractively priced ammonia during the extended spring ammonia application season in 2014 

nitrogen product segments  sales volume increase d due primarily to increased sales of ammonia and an along with the increased sales in the other segment mainly def ammonia volume benefited in 2014  from a combination of attractive pricing compared to other forms of nitrogen fertilizer favorable weather conditions that resulted in an extended spring application season and effective utilization of our terminal and logistics system to resupply in advance of periods of high demand in addition sales to mosaic under our ammonia supply contract from our plnl joint venture also increased volume compared to 2013  an segment sales volume increased due to higher an exports and increased late season an fertilizer demand compared to 2013  def volume increased along with the growing north american def market 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales increased   102 million  from 2013  to 2014  due primarily to higher nitrogen product segments  cost of sales partially offset by the sale of the phosphate business in march 2014 total cost of sales per ton in our nitrogen product segments  averaged 211  in 2014  compared to 172  in 2013  this 23   increase  was due primarily to higher natural gas costs and higher other production costs total realized gas costs increase d 16  natural gas costs for 2014  also included a 795 million  unrealized net marktomarket loss  on natural gas derivatives and 2013  included a 529 million   gain  additionally we incurred higher other production costs including production outage related expenses and distribution and storage expenses compared to 2013  

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses decrease d 141 million  to 1519 million  in 2014  from 1660 million  in 2013  the decrease  was due primarily to lower incentive compensation costs and lower corporate office costs for certain corporate activities such as information technology projects

cf industries holdings inc 

from our plnl joint venture also increase d sales volume compared to 2013  the decrease  in average selling prices from 2013  levels is due primarily to the north american inventory levels that were higher entering 2014 as a result of the shortened 2013 fall ammonia application season caused by cold weather conditions this was partially offset by a stronger pricing environment at the end of 2014 due to tighter supply after the strong 2014 spring season and a high level of global production outages in 2014  

cost of sales   cost of sales in our ammonia segment averaged 331  per ton in 2014  a 23   increase  over the 270  per ton in 2013  due primarily to higher natural gas costs and higher other production cost total gas costs for 2014  increased 16 plus the impact of marktomarket on natural gas derivatives increased ammonia segment gas costs by 429 million compared to 2013

capacity expansion projects and restricted cash 

in 2012 we announced that we would construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex these new plants will increase our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville improve our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location and allow us to benefit from the cost advantages of north american natural gas in combination these new facilities will be able to produce 21 million  tons of gross ammonia per year upgraded products ranging from 20 million to 27 million tons of granular urea per year and up to 18 million tons of uan 32 solution per year depending on our choice of product mix 

in november 2015 the new urea plant at the donaldsonville louisiana complex came on line and was the first plant to be commissioned as part of our capacity expansion projects the uan plant at donaldsonville is expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2016 the remaining plants are expected to be commissioned in mid2016 

the estimated aggregate capital expenditures for both projects remains at approximately 46 billion  and total cash spent to date on capital expenditures for the capacity expansion projects was 35 billion including 17 billion in 2015  we have financed expenditures for the capacity expansion projects through available cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and borrowings in addition 4711 million was invested in the capacity expansion projects and not paid as of december 31 2015  and recognized as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

we have retained engineering and procurement services from an affiliate of thyssenkrupp industrial solutions thyssenkrupp for both capacity expansion projects under the terms of the engineering and procurement services contract we have granted thyssenkrupp a security interest in a restricted cash account and maintain a cash balance in that account equal to the cancellation fees for procurement services and equipment that would arise if we were to cancel the projects the amount in the account will change over time based on procurement costs as of december 31 2015  there was 228 million  held in this account this restricted cash is excluded from our cash and cash equivalents and reported separately on our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows 

capital spending 

we make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements capital expenditures totaled 247 billion  in 2015  as compared to 181 billion  in 2014  the increase in capital expenditures is primarily the result of the 4224 million increase in cash spent on the two capacity expansion projects and increased capital expenditures on sustaining projects in 2015  compared to 2014  

projected capital spending 

we expect capital expenditures in 2016  to be approximately 18 billion  including 12 billion  for the capacity expansion projects and 06 billion  of sustaining and other capital expenditures planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting unanticipated increases in cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties

cf industries holdings inc 

the bridge credit agreement 1 provided for a single borrowing of a tranche a bridge loan of up to 10 billion  that would have been used by cf industries first to reduce amounts outstanding if any under the revolving credit agreement and then for general corporate purposes and 2 provides for a single borrowing of a tranche b bridge loan of up to 30 billion  that may be used by new cf to pay the cash portion if any of the purchase price for specified equity interests to be acquired pursuant to the combination agreement to consummate the refinancing of specified debt in connection with the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement to pay fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the bridge credit agreement and the combination agreement and in an amount of up to 13 billion  for general corporate purposes

forward sales and customer advances 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose therefore our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had 1615 million  and 3254 million  respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets 

while customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances could likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase additionally borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity 

under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales 

derivative financial instruments 

we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because we use derivative instruments volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives 

derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies and in most cases the use of international swaps and derivatives association isda master netting arrangements 

the isda master netting arrangements to most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 2113 million  and 471 million  respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 4315 million mmbtus and 587 million  mmbtus respectively at both december 31 2015  and 2014  we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the notional amount of our open foreign currency derivatives was €890 million  and €2090 million  respectively none  of these open foreign currency derivatives were designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

we contributed 277 million  to our pension plans in 2015  we expect to contribute approximately 398 million  to our pension plans in 2016

operating activities 

year ended december 31 2015  compared to year ended december 31 2014   

net cash provided by operating activities  in 2015  was 120 billion  as compared to 141 billion  in 2014  a decline of 2049 million  this decline  was primarily due to unfavorable  working capital changes as customer advances were lower and inventory levels were higher in 2015  as compared to 2014  levels due to the declining pricing environment for nitrogen fertilizers in 2015 customers delayed making forward purchase commitments to purchase fertilizer in 2015 which reduced the amount of customer advances that were received as compared to 2014 when fertilizer pricing was stronger a poor fall ammonia application season contributed to higher inventory levels in 2015 as compared to 2014 when inventory levels declined 

year ended december 31 2014  compared to year ended december 31 2013   

net cash provided by operating activities  in 2014  was 141 billion  as compared to 147 billion  in 2013  the 582 million   decrease  in net cash provided by operating activities resulted from lower  earnings from core operating activities partially offset by favorable  working capital changes in 2014  as compared to 2013  the lower  earnings from core operating activities were primarily a result of the 7417 million   decline  in gross margin partially offsetting the decline  in gross margin 6386 million   less  was invested in net working capital than in 2013  improvements in working capital during 2014 were due to a combination of higher customer advances lower inventory levels and lower amounts paid for income taxes in 2014 as compared in 2013 customer advances were higher in anticipation of a busy spring 2015 application season combined with tighter north american nitrogen fertilizer supply compared to 2013

subsequent event 

on august 12 2015 we announced that we agreed to enter into a strategic venture with chs inc chs the strategic venture commenced on february 1 2016 at which time chs purchased a minority equity interest in cf industries nitrogen llc cfn a subsidiary of cf holdings for 28 billion  chs also began receiving deliveries from us pursuant to a supply agreement under which chs has the right to purchase annually from us up to approximately 11 million  tons of granular urea and 580000  tons of uan at market prices chs is entitled to semiannual profit distributions from cfn as a result of its minority equity interest in cfn based generally on the volume of granular urea and uan purchased by chs pursuant to the supply agreement 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer the rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one  to eleven years  and the barge charter commitments range from two  to seven years  we also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system some of which contain minimum throughput requirements the storage agreements contain minimum terms generally ranging from one  to five years  and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party see note 24—leases  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information concerning leases 

we do not have any other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap us gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciation and amortization are computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation and amortization expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews 

scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized in property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher depreciation and amortization costs if we used the direct expense method 

cf industries holdings inc 

turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line entitled additions to property plant and equipment 

inventory valuation 

we review our inventory account balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine whether the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their market value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated market value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices are less than our most recent estimate of market value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales 

asset retirement obligations 

asset retirement obligations aros are legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value we have aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing complexes and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposal of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds a liability has not been recorded for these conditional aros the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2015  dollars is 664 million  we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros as of december 31 2015  because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities or our distribution and storage facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each complex or facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities and our distribution and storage facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion 

recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating rates operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review 

the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value and the reduction in value is other than temporary the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earnings 

our joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method and continues to generate positive income and cash flow the financial results are included in the information in 

cf industries holdings inc 

note 8—equity method investments  to the consolidated financial statements the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments in 2015 and 2014 due to major maintenance activities being conducted at upstream natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in the republic of trinidad and tobago these curtailments are expected to continue into the future commitments from ngc regarding the level of future availability and the related cost are not available the future availability and cost of natural gas represents a significant assumption in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing in 2015 our equity in earnings of operating affiliates includes a 619 million  impairment of our equity method investment in plnl no impairment was recognized in 2014  or 2013  related to this investment 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the ammonia granular urea uan an and other segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2015  2014  or 2013  reviews as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the carrying value of our goodwill was 239 billion  and 209 billion  respectively 

intangible assets identified in connection with our 2010 acquisition of terra industries inc consist of customer relationships which are being amortized over a period of 18 years the intangible assets identified in connection with our 2015 acquisition of cf fertilisers uk  consist of customer relationships and trade names which are being amortized over a remaining period of approximately 20  years our intangible assets are presented in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets see note 7—goodwill and other intangible assets  

income taxes 

we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period in which these changes occur 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

a deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and joint venture that are considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income tax liability is recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and joint venture which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested 

as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and joint venture that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods 

cf industries holdings inc 

we operate in a number of countries and as a result have a significant amount of cross border transactions the taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators in countries across the globe including the countries in which we operate the tax rules and regulations within the various countries in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various countries as a result there are instances where regulators within the countries involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances we work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions however there are instances where reaching a common understanding is not possible or practical as of december 31 2015  we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits including penalties and interest of 1826 million which is related predominantly to certain potential tax exposures involving cross border transactions this amount represents our best estimate of the amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions differences in interpretation of the tax laws including agreements between governments surrounding our cross border transactions can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimates 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized key assumptions that affect our projected benefit obligation pbo are discount rates and in addition for our united kingdom plans an adjusted retail price index rpi key assumptions affecting pension expense include discount rates the expected longterm rate of return on assets and in addition for our united kingdom plans rpi 

 the december 31 2015  pbo was computed based on a weightedaverage discount rates of 43  for our north america plans and 38 for our united kingdom plans which were based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo the weightedaverage discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2015  was 40  for north america plans and 37 for united kingdom plans our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 48  weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on assets used to calculate pension expense in 2015  for our north america plans is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods the 54 weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on assets used to calculate pension expense in 2015 for our united kingdom plans is based on expected longterm performance of underlying investments net of investment managers fees the 31 rpi used to calculate our united kingdom plan pbo and pension expense is developed using the bank of england implied retail price inflation curve based on the difference between yields on fixed interest and indexlinked gilts adjusted for inflation risk 

 for north america qualified pension plans our pbo was 7358 million  as of december 31 2015  which was 1092 million  higher than pension plan assets if the discount rate used to compute the pbo for north america plans was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 461 million  higher or 418 million  lower respectively than the amount previously discussed if the discount rate used to compute the 2015  pension expense for north america plans decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 35 million  higher or 28 million  lower respectively than the amount calculated if the expected longterm rate of return on assets for north america plans was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2015  would have been 30 million  lower or higher respectively 

for our united kingdom pension plans our pbo was 5627 million as of december 31 2015 which was 1487 million higher than pension plan assets if the discount rate used to compute the united kingdom pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 470 million higher or 429 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussed if the discount rate used to compute the 2015 united kingdom pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been 05 million  lower or higher respectively if the expected longterm rate of return on assets for our united kingdom plans was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2015 would have been 08 million lower or higher respectively if rpi was higher or lower by 50 basis points our pbo for united kingdom plans would have been 283 million higher or 267 million lower respectively and pension expense for 2015 would have been 05 million higher or lower respectively

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest and use the equity method to account for investments in affiliates that we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies plus the amortization expense of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of purchase accounting our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investments includes considering key factors such as ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions we regularly review for potential changes in the consolidation of variable interest entities

see note 3—new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

discussion of seasonality impacts on operations 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to nitrogenbased fertilizers are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea uan 32 and an by approximately 32 22 14 and 15 respectively 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily with the use of derivative financial instruments covering periods through december 2018 the derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options these derivatives settle using primarily nymex futures price indexes which represent the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had open derivative contracts for 4315 million  mmbtus and 587 million  mmbtus respectively a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas as of december 31 2015  would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of 407 million  and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by 407 million  

from time to time we may purchase nitrogen products on the open market to augment or replace production at our facilities 

interest rate fluctuations 

as of december 31 2015  we had nine series of senior notes totaling 559 billion  outstanding with maturity dates of may 1 2018  may 1 2020  october 15 2022  june 1 2023 october 15 2025  october 15 2027 march 15 2034  june 1 2043 and march 15 2044 the senior notes have fixed interest rates the fair value of our senior notes outstanding as of december 31 2015  was approximately 546 billion  

borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and the bridge credit agreement bear current market rates of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings maximum borrowings during 2015  were 3670 million  and zero  for both 2014  and 2013  there were no  borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2015  or december 31 2014  

foreign currency exchange rates 

since the fourth quarter of 2012 we have entered into eurous dollar derivative hedging transactions related to the eurodenominated construction costs associated with our capacity expansion projects at our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa facilities as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the notional amount of our open foreign currency forward contracts was approximately €890 million  and €2090 million  and the fair value was a net unrealized loss of 01 million  and 224 million  respectively as of december 31 2015  a 10 change in us dollareuro forward exchange rates would change the fair value of these positions by 97 million  

we are also directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro outside of the transactions mentioned above we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies

we are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products in the world our principal customers are cooperatives independent fertilizer distributors and industrial users our principal nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia granular urea and urea ammonium nitrate solution uan our other nitrogen products include ammonium nitrate an diesel exhaust fluid def urea liquor and aqua ammonia which are sold primarily to our industrial customers our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern united states and other major agricultural areas of the united states and canada we also export nitrogen fertilizer products primarily from our donaldsonville louisiana manufacturing facility 

prior to march 17 2014 we also manufactured and distributed phosphate fertilizer products our principal phosphate products were diammonium phosphate dap and monoammonium phosphate map on march 17 2014 we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business the “transaction” which was located in florida to the mosaic company mosaic for approximately 14 billion in cash the transaction followed the terms of a definitive agreement executed in october 2013 the accounts receivable and accounts payable pertaining to the phosphate mining and manufacturing business and certain phosphate inventory held in distribution facilities were not sold to mosaic in the transaction and were settled in the ordinary course 

upon closing the transaction we began to supply mosaic with ammonia produced by our point lisas nitrogen limited plnl joint venture the contract to supply ammonia to mosaic from our plnl joint venture represents the continuation of a supply practice that previously existed between our former phosphate mining and manufacturing business and other operations of the company prior to march 17 2014 plnl sold ammonia to us for use in the phosphate business and the cost was included in our production costs in our phosphate segment subsequent to the sale of the phosphate business we now sell the plnlsourced ammonia to mosaic the revenue from these sales to mosaic and the costs to purchase the ammonia from plnl are now included in our ammonia segment our 50 share of the operating results of our plnl joint venture continues to be included in our equity in earnings of operating affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations because of the significance of this continuing supply practice in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the phosphate mining and manufacturing business is not reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations see note 4—phosphate business disposition  for additional information

during the first quarter of 2014 we sold our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was reported in our phosphate segment additionally we appointed a new president and chief executive officer who is the chief operating decision maker codm as defined under us gaap our reportable segments are based on how the codm assesses performance and allocates resources across the business in the third quarter of 2014 we completed certain changes to our reporting structures that reflect how our codm assesses the performance of our operating segments and makes decisions about resource allocation as a result the number of our reporting segments increased from two to five segments consisting of the following ammonia granular urea uan other and phosphate 

the phosphate segment reflects the reported results of the phosphate business through march 17 2014 plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after march 17 2014 the remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014 therefore the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter however the segment will continue to be included until the reporting of comparable period phosphate results ceases 

the ammonia granular urea uan and other segments are also referred to throughout this document as the “nitrogen product segments for the year ended december 31 2014  we sold 133 million  product tons from the nitrogen product segments  and 05 million  tons of phosphate fertilizers generating net sales of 47 billion  and pretax earnings of 22 billion

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

we operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries inc now our whollyowned subsidiary were canceled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock 

in april 2010 we acquired terra industries inc terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities our 753 interest in tnclp and certain joint venture interests 

cf industries holdings inc 

in march 2014 we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was located in florida to mosaic for approximately 14 billion in cash for the year ended december 31 2014  we recognized pretax and aftertax gains on the sale of 7501 million  and 4628 million  respectively 

product tons and nutrient tons 

unless otherwise stated we measure our production and sales volume in this annual report on form 10k in product tons which represents the weight of the product measured in short tons one short ton is equal to 2000 pounds references to uan product tons assume a 32 nitrogen content basis for production volume 

we also provide certain supplementary volume information measured in nutrient tons nutrient tons represent the weight of the product’s nitrogen content which varies by product ammonia represents 82 nitrogen content granular urea represents 46 nitrogen content and uan represents between 28 and 32 nitrogen content 

operating segments 

as discussed above our reporting segments now consist of the following segments ammonia granular urea uan other and phosphate these segments are differentiated by products which are used differently by agricultural customers based on crop application weather and other agronomic factors or by industrial customers historical financial results have been restated to reflect this new segment structure on a comparable basis the ammonia granular urea uan and other segments are referred to as our “nitrogen product segments see note 5—segment disclosures  for additional information 

we use gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources total other operating costs and expenses consisting of selling general and administrative expenses and other operating—net and nonoperating expenses interest and income taxes are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management 

nitrogen product segments   

we are the largest nitrogen fertilizer producer in north america our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia granular urea and uan our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products from our nitrogen product segments  are shown in the following table net sales do not reflect amounts used internally such as ammonia in the manufacture of other products 



 

 gross margin for the nitrogen product segments  was 18 billion  24 billion  and 29 billion  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

we operate seven nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in north america we own four production facilities in the central united states one in medicine hat alberta canada and one in courtright ontario canada we also have a 753  interest in tnclp and its subsidiary tnlp which owns a nitrogen fertilizer facility in verdigris oklahoma in 2014  the combined production capacity of these seven facilities represented approximately 38 34 46 and 22 of north american ammonia granular urea uan and an production capacity respectively each of our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in north america has onsite storage to provide flexibility to manage the flow of outbound shipments without impacting production

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in 2014  natural gas accounted for approximately 52 of our total production costs for nitrogen fertilizer products our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities have access to abundant competitivelypriced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities we have facilities located at or near the following natural gas hubs henry hub in louisiana oneok in oklahoma aeco in alberta ventura in iowa and dawn in ontario 

our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consume in the aggregate approximately 250 million mmbtus of natural gas annually we employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced supply of natural gas we also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices for further information about our natural gas hedging activities see note 16—derivative financial instruments  

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the safe efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer products to terminals warehouses and customers each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location 

our north american nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the us and canada with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5900 tank and hopper cars as well as railcars provided by rail carriers 

the north american waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our donaldsonville verdigris and yazoo city facilities we employ a fleet of ten leased tow boats and 32 river barges to ship ammonia and uan we also utilize contract marine services to move urea fertilizer 

three of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia the donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2000mile long nustar pipeline through which we transport ammonia to more than 20 terminals and shipping points in the midwestern us corn belt our verdigris and port neal facilities are connected to the 1100mile long magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the us midwest

phosphate segment 

the phosphate segment reflects the reported results of the phosphate business through march 17 2014 plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after march 17 2014 the remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014 therefore the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter although the segment will continue to be included until the reporting of comparable period phosphate results ceases upon selling the phosphate business we began to supply mosaic with ammonia produced by our plnl joint venture the contract to supply ammonia to mosaic from our plnl joint venture represents the continuation of a supply practice that previously existed between our former phosphate mining and manufacturing business and other operations of the company prior to march 17 2014 plnl sold ammonia to us for use in the phosphate business and the cost was included in our production costs in our phosphate segment subsequent to the sale of the phosphate business we now sell the plnlsourced ammonia to mosaic the revenue from these sales to mosaic and the costs to purchase the ammonia from plnl are now included in our ammonia segment our 50 share of the operating results of our plnl joint venture continues to be included in equity in earnings of operating affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations because of the significance of this continuing supply practice in accordance with us gaap the phosphate mining and manufacturing business is not reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for additional information regarding this sale see note 4—phosphate business disposition  and note 22—assets and liabilities held for sale  

our historical sales of phosphate fertilizer products are shown in the table below 



gross margin for the phosphate segment was 101 million  749 million  and 1997 million for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

storage facilities and other properties 

as of december 31 2014  we owned or leased space at 86  inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 22state region and canada including storage at our production facilities we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately 27 million tons of fertilizer our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table

customers 

the principal customers for our nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products are cooperatives independent fertilizer distributors and industrial users none of our customers in 2014  accounted for more than ten percent of our consolidated net sales sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force 

competition 

our markets are global and intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

for our nitrogen product segments  our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium inc koch fertilizer llc and potash corporation of saskatchewan inc there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition from foreignsourced products continuously 

seasonality 

in north america the sales patterns of our major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

financial information about foreign and domestic sales and operations 

the amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying value of our foreign and domestic assets are set forth in note 5—segment disclosures  

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act tsca and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment 

environmental health and safety expenditures 

our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2014  totaled approximately 480 million in 2015  we estimate that we will spend approximately 460 million for environmental health and safety capital expenditures environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

clean air act—section 185 fee 

our donaldsonville nitrogen complex is located in a fiveparish region near baton rouge louisiana that as of 2005 was designated as being in severe nonattainment with respect to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone the 1hour ozone standard pursuant to the federal clean air act the act section 185 of the act requires states in their state 

cf industries holdings inc 

implementation plans to levy a fee section 185 fee on major stationary sources such as the donaldsonville complex located in a severe nonattainment area that did not meet the 1hour ozone standard by november 30 2005 for additional information on the section 185 fee see note 24—contingencies  

clean air act information request 

on february 26 2009 we received a letter from the environmental protection agency epa under section 114 of the act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with new source review and new source performance standards at our donaldsonville facility for additional information on the clean air act information request see note 24—contingencies  

cerclaremediation matters 

from time to time we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws in 2002 and in 2009 we were asked by the current owner of a former phosphate mine and processing facility that we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho to contribute to a cleanup of the former processing portion of the site for additional information on the cerclaremediation matters see note 24—contingencies  

regulation of greenhouse gases 

we are subject to regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states concerning greenhouse gas ghg emissions 

the united kingdom is a party to the kyoto protocol as a result of agreements reached during a conference in durban south africa in 2011 the kyoto protocol will continue in force for a second commitment period which will expire by 2020 to be replaced by another international agreement to be negotiated by 2015 which agreement is to go into effect in 2020 the united kingdom has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas trading system our joint venture uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require the joint venture to purchase co 2  emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our joint venture uk sites are also subject to the european union emissions trading scheme 

in canada which in december 2011 withdrew from further participation in the kyoto protocol but signed the durban platform to negotiate a new international ghg agreement or protocol by 2015 we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canadas national pollutant release inventory and ontarios mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation ontario is party to the western climate initiative wci comprising california and several canadian provinces the province of quebec a wci party and california have created a regional program linking their cap and trade emissions programs 

 although ontario has not disavowed its participation in the initiative it has not developed regulations to establish a cap and trade program in alberta the specified gas emitters regulation ghg regulation was implemented in 2007 this program requires facilities emitting more than 100000 tons of ghgs per year to reduce emissions by 12 over 2007 levels to meet this requirement companies can reduce emissions purchaseuse offset credits or contribute to a technology fund at a rate of 15 per ton of co 2  currently our medicine hat facility’s method of compliance is to make contributions to the technology fund 

in the united states not a party to the kyoto protocol but a signatory to the durban platform with respect to the negotiation of a replacement for the kyoto protocol ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels the epa has issued federal ghg regulations that impact our facilities including a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in may 2010 the epa issued the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule which rule would have subjected certain large sources of ghg emissions to air permitting requirements solely because of their emissions of ghgs in utility air regulatory group v epa  134 s ct 2427 2014 the supreme court concluded that the clean air act could not be interpreted to require sources to be subject to these permit programs solely because of their ghg emissions however the court also held that ghg emissions could be regulated at a facility that would otherwise be required to obtain a psd permit to construct or modify a facility due to the facilitys emissions of other regulated air pollutants regulation of ghg emissions pursuant to the psd program could subject new capital projects to additional permitting requirements that may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects 

cf industries holdings inc 

under the title v provisions of the tailoring rule all of our us manufacturing facilities will be required to include ghg emissions in future title v air permit applications other than the states implementation of the tailoring rule none of the states where our us production facilities are located—louisiana mississippi iowa and oklahoma—has proposed control regulations limiting ghg emissions 

revisions to new source performance standards for nitric acid plants 

we operate 13 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides no x  notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas 

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals 

employees and labor relations 

as of december 31 2014  we employed approximately 2200 fulltime and 100 parttime employees

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is dependent on north american natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea uan and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our nitrogen fertilizers 

the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2014  the average daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america reached a low of 275  per mmbtu on december 26 2014  and a high of 794  per mmbtu on march 5 2014  during the three year period ended december 31 2014  the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 184  per mmbtu on april 20 2012  and a high of 794  per mmbtu on march 5 2014  

changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

north american natural gas prices have declined over the last several years in response to increased supply from the development of natural gas production from shale formations future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas if this were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply demand balance 

periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacity 

during periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities 

some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships 

china the worlds largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capacity in the medium term if chinese government policy or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs 

cf industries holdings inc 

such as the price of chinese coal encourages exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

antidumping duties for russian and ukrainian fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate ended in november 2014 as a result we could face much higher volumes of lower priced russian and ukrainian fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate in the united states 

a decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products 

conditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control 

state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate the renewable fuel mandate which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand in december 2014 the epa announced that the final ruling of the renewable fuels volumes required for calendar year 2014 would not be finalized in 2014 and would be made prior to or in conjunction with action on the standards applicable for calendar year 2015 developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment 

our operations and those of our joint ventures are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and any delay or interruption in the delivery may adversely affect our business 

we and our joint ventures use natural gas in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase the natural gas from third party suppliers and it is transported by pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint ventures by third party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of natural gas including those caused by capacity constraints leaks ruptures severe weather or natural disasters unscheduled downtime labor difficulties deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents or mechanical failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers this exposes us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to additional liability 

we rely on railroad truck pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards additionally due to the aging infrastructure of certain bridges roadways rail lines river locks and other equipment that our third party service providers utilize we may experience delays in both the receipt of raw materials or the shipment of finished product while repairs maintenance or replacement activities are conducted also certain third party service providers particularly railroads have experienced recent periodic service slowdowns due to capacity constraints in their systems which impact the shipping times of our products 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products 

cf industries holdings inc 

if shipping of our products was delayed or we were unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads have implemented tariffs that include provisions that purport to shift liability to shippers to the extent that liabilities arise from third parties with insufficient resources these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products 

our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacture transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled plant downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage 

in april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility we have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed in 2013 and 2014 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our product to west fertilizer co products we have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident based on our assessment of the pending lawsuits we believe that we have strong legal and factual defenses to the claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in the pending lawsuits and any other claims brought against us in connection with the incident in addition the increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilities 

cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results 

as we continue to increase our dependence on information technologies to conduct our operations the risks associated with cyber security also increase we rely on management information systems and computer control systems business and supply chain disruptions plant and utility outages and information technology system and network disruptions due to cyber attacks could seriously harm our operations and materially adversely affect our operating results cyber security risks include attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers damage or loss of information due to viruses the unintended disclosure of confidential information the misuse or loss of control over computer control systems and breaches due to 

cf industries holdings inc 

employee error our exposure to cyber security risks includes exposure through third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our systems and information from being vulnerable to cyber attacks we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate to date we have not experienced any material impact from cyber security events however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate prevent or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks compromises to our information and control systems could have severe financial and other business implications 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations 

weather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogenbased fertilizers colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freezeoffs or hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise 

we may not be able to complete our capacity expansion projects on schedule as planned on budget or at all due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

we are constructing new ammonia and ureauan plants at our complex in donaldsonville louisiana and new ammonia and urea units at our complex in port neal iowa we recently announced that the total cost of these projects is estimated to be approximately 42 billion  the total amount invested in these projects through december 31 2014  was 20 billion  

the design development construction and startup of the new plants are subject to a number of risks any of which could prevent us from completing the projects on schedule as planned and on budget or at all including cost overruns performance of third parties permitting matters adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor and raw material shortages transportation constraints engineering and construction change orders errors in the design construction or startup and other unforeseen difficulties 

the donaldsonville and port neal expansion projects are dependent on the availability and performance of the engineering firms construction firms equipment suppliers transportation providers and other vendors necessary to design and build the new units on a timely basis and on acceptable economic terms if any of the third parties fails to perform as we expect our ability to meet our expansion goals would be affected 

our expansion plans may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences such as the diversion of managements attention from our existing plants and businesses and other opportunities 

other expansions of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both domestically and in foreign locations major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments require significant managerial resources the diversion of which from our other activities may impair the operation of our business the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or business combination transactions are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments  among the risks associated with the pursuit and consummation of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments or business combination transactions are those involving 

 14 

cf industries holdings inc 

 

international acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination or investments and other international expansions of our business involve additional risks and uncertainties including 

 

if we finance acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints under the terms of and as a result of the repayment and debtservice obligations under the additional indebtedness a business combination transaction between us and another company could result in our stockholders receiving cash or shares of another entity on terms that such stockholders may not consider desirable 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws regulations and permitting requirements as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the rcra the cercla the tsca and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes 

as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

cf industries holdings inc 

violations of environmental health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental health and safety laws and regulations additionally future environmental health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures additionally our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses 

expansion or modification of our operations is predicated upon securing necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at our facilities and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are dependent on numerous required permits and approvals and meeting financial assurance requirements of governmental authorities 

we hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion of our operations is dependent upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in certain cases as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals or as a condition to maintaining existing approvals we may be required to comply with regulatory financial assurance requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure local state or federal government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care and reclamation at our facilities 

future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to greenhouse gas ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states or canada our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us 

our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season 

if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the 

cf industries holdings inc 

selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from us 

a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assets 

any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as of december 31 2014  and 2013  our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders was approximately 16  and 7  respectively of our cash and cash equivalents 

we believe the ability to purchase product on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses 

we often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased fertilizers we have used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts 

our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidity 

hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are either multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments 

we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities 

our nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in seven separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represents approximately 40 of our ammonia production capacity the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition 

cf industries holdings inc 

our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane activity and our other complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas in the respective regions 

we are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventures 

we participate in joint ventures including point lisas which owns a facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago growhow which owns facilities in billingham and ince united kingdom and keytrade a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near zurich switzerland our joint venture partners may share a measure of control over the operations of our joint ventures as a result our investments in joint ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our joint ventures or our partners have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions requests policies or objectives subject a joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business 

in addition we may become involved in disputes with our joint venture partners which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

our joint venture in point lisas in the republic of trinidad and tobago operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited “ngc” the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments due to major maintenance activities being conducted at natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in trinidad these curtailments are expected to continue into 2015 and it is unclear if they will extend beyond that time failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture which could result in impairment to the value of the joint venture and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives we are subject to various security laws including the maritime transportation security act of 2002   mtsa and the chemical facilities antiterrorism standards cfats regulation in addition president obama issued executive order eo 13650 improving chemical facility safety and security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators local state federal and foreign governments could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives it is possible that the united states or foreign governments could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for us 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations 

our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions during 2014  we derived approximately 16  of our net sales from outside of the united states our business operations include our nitrogen fertilizer complex in medicine hat alberta our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in courtright ontario a 50  interest in an ammonia production joint venture in trinidad a 50  interest in a uk joint venture for the production of anhydrous ammonia and other fertilizer products and a 50  interest in a fertilizer trading operation headquartered near zurich switzerland

our investments in securities are subject to risks that may result in losses 

our cash flows from operations have resulted in cash and cash equivalents of approximately 20 billion  as of december 31 2014  we generally invest these cash and cash equivalents in what we believe to be relatively shortterm highly liquid and high credit quality instruments including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental entities include those issued directly by the united states government those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities our investments are subject to fluctuations in both market value and yield based upon changes in market conditions including interest rates liquidity general economic and credit market conditions and conditions specific to the issuers 

due to the risks of investments we may not achieve expected returns or may realize losses on our investments which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories the overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted 

in addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizer significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact on the importation of fertilizers foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 

we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness or need to refinance existing indebtedness in the future which may adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 46 billion  of total indebtedness consisting primarily of senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2018  and 2044  we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing revolving credit facility of approximately 9951 million  

our substantial debt service obligations could have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow our substantial indebtedness could as a result of our debt service obligation or through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it could 

 19 

cf industries holdings inc 

from time to time we consider our options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future if we incur additional indebtedness the risks that we now face as a result of our leverage could intensify if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate our relations with our creditors including the holders of our outstanding debt securities the lenders under our revolving credit facility and our suppliers may be materially and adversely affected

we are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products in the world our principal customers are cooperatives independent fertilizer distributors and industrial users our principal nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia granular urea and urea ammonium nitrate solution uan our other nitrogen products include ammonium nitrate an diesel exhaust fluid def urea liquor and aqua ammonia which are sold primarily to our industrial customers our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern united states and other major agricultural areas of the united states and canada we also export nitrogen fertilizer products primarily from our donaldsonville louisiana manufacturing facility 

prior to march 17 2014 we also manufactured and distributed phosphate fertilizer products our principal phosphate products were diammonium phosphate dap and monoammonium phosphate map on march 17 2014 we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business the “transaction” which was located in florida to the mosaic company mosaic pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement dated as of october 28 2013 the “purchase agreement” among cf industries holdings inc cf industries and mosaic for approximately 14 billion in cash 

upon selling the phosphate business we began to supply mosaic with ammonia produced by our point lisas nitrogen limited plnl joint venture the contract to supply ammonia to mosaic from our plnl joint venture represents the continuation of a supply practice that previously existed between our former phosphate mining and manufacturing business and other operations of the company prior to march 17 2014 plnl sold ammonia to us for use in the phosphate business and the cost was included in our production costs in our phosphate segment subsequent to the sale of phosphate business we now sell the plnlsourced ammonia to mosaic the revenue from these sales to mosaic and the costs to purchase the ammonia from plnl are now included in our ammonia segment our 50 share of the operating results of our plnl joint venture continues to be included in our equity in earnings of operating affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations because of the significance of this continuing supply practice in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the

phosphate mining and manufacturing business is not reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 

our principal assets include 

 during the first quarter of 2014 we sold the phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was reported in the phosphate segment additionally we appointed a new president and chief executive officer who is the chief operating decision maker codm as defined under us gaap our reportable segments are based on how the codm assesses performance and allocates resources across the business in the third quarter of 2014 we completed certain changes to our reporting structures that reflect how our codm assesses the performance of our operating segments and makes decisions about resource allocation as a result the number of our reporting segments increased from two to five segments consisting of the following ammonia granular urea uan other and phosphate these segments are differentiated by products which are used differently by agricultural customers based on crop application weather and other agronomic factors or by industrial customers historical financial results have been restated to reflect the new segment structure on a comparable basis 

the phosphate segment reflects the reported results of the phosphate business through march 17 2014 plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after march 17 2014 the remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014 therefore the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter however the segment will continue to be included until the reporting of comparable period phosphate results ceases the ammonia granular urea uan and other segments are referred to in this discussion and analysis as the “nitrogen product segments” 

our management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources total other operating costs and expenses consisting of selling general and administrative expenses and other operatingnet and non‑operating expenses interest and income taxes are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management 

a description of our five reporting segments is included in the discussion of the operating results by business segment later in this discussion and analysis 

items affecting comparability of results 

phosphate business disposition 

in 2014 we sold our phosphate mining and manufacturing business and recognized pretax and aftertax gains on the sale of the phosphate business of 7501 million and 4628 million respectively under the terms of the purchase agreement the accounts receivable and accounts payable pertaining to the phosphate mining and manufacturing business and certain phosphate inventory held in distribution facilities were not sold to mosaic in the transaction and were settled in the ordinary course 

cf industries holdings inc 

upon closing the transaction we began to supply mosaic with ammonia produced by our plnl joint venture the contract to supply ammonia to mosaic from our plnl joint venture represents the continuation of a supply practice that previously existed between our former phosphate mining and manufacturing business and other operations of the company prior to march 17 2014 plnl sold ammonia to us for use in the phosphate business and the cost was included in our production costs in our phosphate segment subsequent to the sale of the phosphate business we now sell the plnlsourced ammonia to mosaic the revenue from these sales to mosaic and the costs to purchase the ammonia from plnl are now included in our ammonia segment our 50 share of the operating results of our plnl joint venture continues to be included in our equity in earnings of operating affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations because of the significance of this continuing supply practice in accordance with us gaap the phosphate mining and manufacturing business is not reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 

the phosphate segment reflects the reported results of the phosphate business through march 17 2014 plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after march 17 2014 the remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014 therefore the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter however the segment will continue to be included until the reporting of comparable period phosphate results ceases 

the phosphate mining and manufacturing business assets we sold in the transaction include the hardee county phosphate rock mine the plant city phosphate complex an ammonia terminal phosphate warehouse and dock at the port of tampa and the site of the former bartow phosphate complex in addition mosaic assumed certain liabilities related to the phosphate mining and manufacturing business including responsibility for closure water treatment and longterm maintenance and monitoring of the phosphogypsum stacks at the plant city and bartow complexes mosaic also received the value of the phosphate mining and manufacturing business’s asset retirement obligation trust and escrow funds totaling approximately 200 million the assets and liabilities sold to and assumed by mosaic were classified as held for sale as of december 31 2013 therefore no depreciation depletion or amortization was recorded in 2014 for the related property plant and equipment 

cfl selling price modifications 

prior to april 30 2013 cf industries owned 49 of the voting common shares and 66 of the nonvoting preferred shares of canadian fertilizers limited cfl an alberta canada based nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer and had the right to purchase 66 of the production of cfl also prior to april 30 2013 viterra inc viterra held 34 of the equity ownership of cfl and had the right to purchase up to the remaining 34 of cfls production both cf industries and viterra were entitled to receive distributions of net earnings of cfl based upon their respective purchases from cfl cfl was a variable interest entity that was consolidated in our financial statements on april 30 2013 cf industries completed the acquisitions of all of the outstanding interests in cfl that it did not already own and cfl became our whollyowned subsidiary once cfl became a whollyowned subsidiary cf industries began purchasing all of the output of cfl for resale and reported those sales in its consolidated financial statements at market prices 

cf industries and viterras purchases of nitrogen fertilizer products from cfl were made under product purchase agreements and the selling prices were determined under the provisions of these agreements until april 30 2013 when cfl became a whollyowned subsidiary in our consolidated financial statements net sales and accounts receivable attributable to cfl were solely generated by transactions with viterra as all transactions with cf industries were eliminated in consolidation in our financial statements 

the following summarizes the selling prices in the product purchase agreements that impacted the companys results due to sales transactions to viterra both before and after the effective date of the amendment 

 as a result the consolidated financial results for 2014 included twelve months of marketbased selling prices while 2013 included four months of selling prices based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin and eight months of marketbased selling prices the 2012 annual period included twelve months of selling prices based upon production cost plus an agreedupon margin these changes affect the yearoveryear comparability of net sales gross margin operating earnings earnings before income taxes and net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest but do not impact the comparability of our net earnings attributable to common stockholders or net cash flows for the same period

in order to provide comparable information for the periods presented certain financial information is being provided for the prior year comparable periods adjusted as if the current year of twelve months of marketbased selling prices had been used in the prior year comparable periods 

we report our consolidated financial results in accordance with us gaap management believes that the presentation in this report of nongaap financial measures of certain adjusted data and the periodtoperiod percentage changes in such measures provides investors with additional meaningful information to assess periodtoperiod changes in our underlying operating performance this information includes consolidated net sales gross margin net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest in addition to segment net sales gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales and average selling prices per ton of ammonia and granular urea presented on an as adjusted basis as if all cfl sales to the noncontrolling interest had been priced based on marketbased selling prices for the twelve months of 2013 and 2012 these nongaap financial measures are provided only for the purpose of facilitating comparisons between the periods operating performance and do not purport to represent what our actual consolidated results of operations would have been nor are they necessarily indicative of our future consolidated results of operations nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with us gaap 

net operating loss nol settlement 

at the time of our initial public offering ipo in 2005 we had accumulated a substantial amount of nols due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefit from the nols when we ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for income tax purposes and became a public company a full valuation allowance was recorded against the benefit of those nols at that time we entered into an agreement nol agreement with the preipo owners under which they would benefit should any of the preipo nols be realized in future years by using the nols to offset postipo taxable income if this were to occur we would pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved as of december 31 2012 the nols had a potential tax benefit of 943 million which had been fully reserved by the valuation allowance 

in january 2013 we and the preipo owners amended the nol agreement to provide among other things that we would be entitled to retain 269 of any settlement realized and 731 would be payable to them 

in march 2013 we entered into a closing agreement with the internal revenue service irs to resolve the tax treatment of the preipo nols pursuant to the closing agreement we agreed with the irs that we will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to a portion of the nols over five years commencing with the 2012 tax year the 206 million net benefit from this nol settlement was recognized in the first quarter of 2013 as follows

 key industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our agricultural products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply  demand 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key exportingconsuming countries such as china india and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs availability of raw materials government policies and global trade 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america declined over the past several years but are subject to volatility during the three year period ended december 31 2014  the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 794  per mmbtu on march 5 2014  and a low of 184  per mmbtu on april 20 2012  natural gas costs including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives rose   16  in 2014  from 2013  expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs for example natural gas costs including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 52 of our nitrogen product segments total production costs in 2014 

farmers economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns crop prices and the types of crops planted 

cf industries holdings inc 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east ukraine republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa russia and china are major exporters to north america 

government policies 

the policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports the subsidization of natural gas prices the subsidization of domestic producers and the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by political and social objectives 

ethanol industry and the renewable fuel standard 

corn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 38 of total us corn demand us government policy as expressed in the renewable fuel standard rfs is a major determinant for the ethanol market the rfs establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels including ethanol that must be included in the united states’ supply of fuel for transportation for 2015 the environmental protection agency epa has yet to determine the rfs resulting in uncertainty for ethanol demand in addition congress at various times has proposed legislation to either reduce or eliminate the rfs while past legislation proposing changes to the rfs has not passed there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be passed into law other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol gasoline and corn lower gasoline prices may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry 

factors affecting our results 

net sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we often use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing costs for nitrogenbased fertilizer we report our natural gas derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward sales and customer advances later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment volatility in quarterly reported earnings also may arise from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of derivatives 

selling general and administrative expenses our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees including those for corporate initiatives 

cf industries holdings inc 

other operating—net other operating—net includes the costs associated with engineering studies for proposed capital projects administrative costs associated with our capacity expansion projects and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations costs included in other costs can include foreign exchange gains and losses unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives costs associated with our closed facilities amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates we have investments accounted for under the equity method for which the results are included in our operating earnings these consist of the following 1 50  ownership interest in plnl and 2 50  interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in houston texas we include our share of the net earnings from these investments as an element of earnings from operations because these investments provide additional production and storage capacity to our operations and are integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities in the nitrogen product segments our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition 

interest expense our interest expense includes the interest on our longterm debt amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements and annual fees on our senior revolving credit facility capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the facility along with all other construction costs 

interest income our interest income represents amounts earned on our cash cash equivalents investments and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 

income tax provision our income tax provision includes all currently payable and deferred united states and foreign income tax expense applicable to our ongoing operations 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the entities that we account for using the equity method and exclude from operating earnings income taxes related to these investments if any are reflected in this line the amounts recorded as equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes relate to our investments in growhow and keytrade our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition we account for these investments as nonoperating equity method investments and exclude the net earnings of these investments in earnings from operations since these operations do not provide additional production capacity to us nor are these operations integrated within our supply chain 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest include the net earnings attributable to the 247  interest of the publiclyheld common units of tnclp net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest for the first four months of 2013 and all of 2012 also included the interest of the 34 holder of cfls equity ownership on april 30 2013 we purchased the noncontrolling interests of cfl 

we own an aggregate 753  of tnclp and outside investors own the remaining 247  the tnclp agreement of limited partnership allows the general partner to receive incentive distribution rights once a minimum distribution threshold has been met partnership interests in tnclp are traded on the nyse and tnclp is separately registered with the sec

consolidated operating results 

during the third quarter of 2014 we adopted a new segment reporting structure that includes the following five segments ammonia granular urea uan other and phosphate the ammonia granular urea uan and other segments are referred to in this discussion and analysis as the “ nitrogen product segments ” 

our total gross margin declined  by 7417 million  or 29  to 18 billion  in 2014  from 25 billion  in 2013  the sale of the phosphate business reduced gross margin between the periods by 648 million  as the business was sold in the first quarter of 2014 but had reported results in both the first six months of 2014 and the entire year in 2013 gross margin for the nitrogen product segments   decline d by 6769 million  or 28  this decline  in gross margin is due primarily to the following factors 

 37 

cf industries holdings inc 

net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 14 billion  for 2014  included a 7501 million  pretax gain   4628 million  after tax on the sale of the phosphate business 795 million  unrealized net marktomarket loss   501 million  after tax on natural gas derivatives 307 million  of expenses   194 million  after tax related to our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa 384 million   242 million  after tax realized and unrealized net loss es on foreign currency derivatives and 131 million 82 million after tax of retirement benefits settlement charges net earnings in 2013  of 15 billion  included a 529 million  unrealized net marktomarket gain   335 million  after tax on natural gas derivatives 108 million  of expenses  68 million  after tax related to our capacity expansion projects a 208 million   132 million  after tax realized and unrealized net gain s on foreign currency derivatives and a net 206 million   benefit  from a settlement with the irs concerning certain preipo nols 

net sales 

net sales decreased   7315 million  or 13  to 47 billion  in 2014  compared to 55 billion  in 2013  these results were impacted by the cfl selling price modifications in the prior year on an as adjusted basis 2014 net sales decreased 14 compared to 2013 the 7315 million decrease  in net sales is attributable to a 1030 million   decrease  in the nitrogen product segments  and a 6285 million   decrease  in the phosphate segment due to the sale of the phosphate business in march 2014 

nitrogen product segments  net sales decrease d 1030 million  or 2 due primarily to a 4   decline  in average selling prices partially offset by a 3   increase  in sales volume nitrogen product segments average selling prices declined due primarily to lower ammonia and uan selling prices compared to the prior year period ammonia prices were lower due primarily to the higher producer inventory levels that carried over from the end of 2013 as compared to the previous year as a result of the shortened 2013 fall ammonia application season caused by cold weather conditions the decline in uan prices was due primarily to customer preferences for attractively priced ammonia during the extended spring ammonia application season in 2014 

nitrogen product segments  sales volume increase d due primarily to increased sales of ammonia and increased sales in the other segment mainly an and def ammonia volume benefited this year from a combination of attractive pricing compared to other forms of nitrogen fertilizer favorable weather conditions that resulted in an extended spring application season and effective utilization of our terminal and logistics system to resupply in advance of periods of high demand in addition sales to mosaic under our ammonia supply contract from our plnl joint venture also increased volume compared to the prior year period other segment sales volume increased due to higher an exports and increased late season an fertilizer demand compared to the prior year period def volume increased along with the growing north american def market 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales increased   102 million  from 2013  to 2014  due primarily to higher   nitrogen product segments  cost of sales partially offset by the sale of the phosphate business in march 2014 total cost of sales per ton in our nitrogen product segments  averaged 211  per ton in 2014  compared to 172  per ton in 2013  this 23   increase  was due primarily to higher natural gas costs and higher other production costs total realized gas costs increased 16 natural gas costs for the current year also included a 795 million unrealized net marktomarket loss  on natural gas derivatives and 2013  included a 529 million   gain  additionally we incurred higher other production costs including production outage related expenses and distribution and storage expenses compared to the prior year 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses decrease d 141 million  to 1519 million  in 2014  from 1660 million  in 2013  the decrease  was due primarily to lower incentive compensation costs and lower corporate office costs for certain corporate activities such as information technology projects 

other operating—net 

other operating—net changed by 691 million  from 158 million  of income  in 2013  to expense  of 533 million  in 2014  the increase d expense was due primarily to 384 million  of losses on foreign currency derivatives in 2014 compared to 208 million  of gains in 2013 additionally expenses related to the capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa that did not qualify for capitalization increased by 199 million between the years

phosphate business disposition 

in march 2014 we completed the sale of the company’s phosphate mining and manufacturing business to mosaic pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement dated as of october 28 2013 among the company cf industries and mosaic for approximately 14 billion  in cash in 2014 we recognized pretax and aftertax gains on the sale of the phosphate business of 7501 million  and 4628 million  respectively 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates  consists of our 50 share of the operating results of plnl and our 50 interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in houston texas equity in earnings of operating affiliates  was 431 million  in 2014  as compared to 417 million  in 2013  the increase  was due primarily to improved operating results from plnl 

interest—net 

net interest expense was 1773 million  in 2014  compared to 1475 million  in 2013  the 298 million   increase  in net interest expense was due primarily to the interest expense on the 15 billion of senior notes issued during the first quarter of 2014 and the 15 billion of senior notes issued during the second quarter of 2013 this increase was partially offset by capitalized interest of 742 million  in 2014  primarily related to our capacity expansion projects compared to 267 million  in 2013  

other nonoperating—net 

other nonoperatingnet was a 19 million   expense  in 2014  compared to expense  of 545 million  in 2013  as discussed under items affecting comparability of resultsnet operating loss settlement in 2013 a charge of 552 million  was recognized for the 731 portion of the nols we had accumulated prior to our 2005 public offering that will be paid to preipo owners as nol tax benefits are realized 

income taxes 

our income tax provision for 2014  was 7730 million  on pretax income of 22 billion  or an effective tax rate of 353  compared to an income tax provision of 6865 million  on pretax income of 22 billion  or an effective tax rate of 311  in the prior year the primary increase  in the effective tax rate in 2014  was due to the fact that we recognized a tax benefit in 2013 for the impact of our closing agreement with the irs 22 enabling us to utilize a portion of our preipo nols the current year effective tax rate is also impacted by reduced tax benefits from depletion 11 related to our disposed phosphate business the income tax provision in 2014 includes 2873 million of income tax expense relating to the phosphate business sale which increased the effective tax rate by 15 

the effective tax rate does not reflect a tax provision on the earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest in tnclp a partnership which is not a taxable entity for additional information on income taxes see note 12—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes  consists of our share of the operating results of unconsolidated joint venture interests in growhow and keytrade the 129 million   increase  in 2014  compared to 2013  was due primarily to increased earnings from growhow reflecting lower natural gas prices in the united kingdom and improved trading performance at keytrade 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased   217 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  due primarily to lower net earnings attributable to the 247  interest of the publiclyheld common units of tnclp 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders   increased  to 2708  in 2014  from 2474  in 2013  due primarily to the gain on the phosphate business sale and a lower  weightedaverage number of outstanding shares due to the impact of share repurchase programs we repurchased 77 million  shares in 2014 for 19 billion  or an average cost of 250 per share the total shares repurchased during 2014 represent 14  of the shares outstanding as of december 31 2013

consolidated operating results 

net sales and net earnings for 2013 declined in both the nitrogen product segments and the phosphate segment from prior year levels these declines were due to increased supply and weakness in global fertilizer markets higher exports by chinese producers increased supply and weighed on global nitrogen prices while weaker demand from india had a similar impact on phosphate prices north american demand in 2013 for both the nitrogen and the phosphate fertilizers was impacted by a delayed fall application period due to a late harvest and a narrow application window due to adverse weather in the midwest additionally an 8  increase in realized natural gas costs contributed to lower earnings in 2013 compared to 2012 

our total gross margin decreased by 5931 million  or 19  to 25 billion  in 2013  from 31 billion  in 2012  reflecting declines in the nitrogen product segments  and the phosphate segment the consolidated gross margin was impacted by the cfl selling price modifications previously discussed on an as adjusted basis the gross margin decreased 22  from the prior year 

in the nitrogen product segments the gross margin decreased by 4683 million or 16 to 24 billion as compared to 29 billion in 2012 due primarily to an 8 decrease in average selling prices an 8 increase in realized natural gas costs and a 136 million decrease in net unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in 2013 as compared to 2012 the nitrogen product segments gross margin was impacted by the cfl sales price modifications 

in the phosphate segment gross margin decreased by 1248 million  or 62  to 749 million  in 2013  from 1997 million  in 2012  due primarily to a 13  decline in average selling prices and a 9   decrease  in sales volume

operating results by business segment 

our business was previously organized and managed internally based on two segments the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment during the first quarter of 2014 we sold the phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was   reported in the phosphate segment additionally we appointed a new president and chief executive officer who is the chief operating decision maker codm as defined under us gaap our reportable segments are based on how the codm assesses performance and allocates resources across the business 

in the third quarter of 2014 we completed certain changes to our reporting structures that reflect how our codm assesses the performance of our operating segments and makes decisions about resource allocation as a result the number of our reporting segments increased from two to five segments consisting of the following ammonia granular urea uan other and phosphate these segments are differentiated by products which are used differently by agricultural customers based on crop application weather and other agronomic factors or by industrial customers historical financial results have been restated to reflect the new segment structure on a comparable basis the ammonia granular urea uan and other segments are referred to in this discussion and analysis as the nitrogen product segments 

the phosphate segment reflects the reported results of the phosphate business through march 17 2014 plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after march 17 2014 the remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014 therefore the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter however the segment will continue to be included until the reporting of comparable period phosphate results ceases we use gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources total other operating costs and expenses consisting of selling general and administrative expenses and other operating — net and non‑operating expenses interest and income taxes are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management

during 2014  the following significant events have had or will have an impact on our cash and liquidity position 

 further details regarding these events are provided below 

cash and cash equivalents 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 20 billion  and 17 billion  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less under our shortterm investment policy we may invest our cash balances either directly or through mutual funds in several types of investmentgrade securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations securities issued by governmental entities include those issued directly by the us and canadian federal governments those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities

 capacity expansion projects and restricted cash 

we are currently constructing new ammonia and ureauan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex in combination these new facilities will be able to produce 21 million  tons of gross ammonia per year upgraded products ranging from 20 million to 27 million tons of granular urea per year and up to 18 million tons of uan 32 solution per year depending on our choice of product mix 

we recently updated our cost estimate to complete the projects to construct new ammonia urea and uan plants at donaldsonville louisiana and new ammonia and urea plants at port neal iowa the update was based upon refined estimates for specific quantities of construction materials and workhours based upon final issuedforconstruction drawings from the engineering firms designing the plants 

based on this review the aggregate cost estimate for both projects has increased just under 10 from the original 38 billion  to approximately 42 billion  the total project cost includes engineering and design equipment procurement construction associated infrastructure including natural gas connections and power supply and product storage and handling systems taking into account the more detailed engineering and construction information and additional progress we have made on the projects the potential variance to the budget has also been tightened to plus or minus a few percentage points as compared to the original plus or minus 10 level of accuracy 

we have found that the full impact of the costs associated with building the plants in western iowa will exceed the original estimate due to increases in material content and higher labor costs than initially modeled there are additional materials and work hours needed for increased construction and winterization scope and higher wage and per diem rates to attract and retain the qualified skilledtrade workers compared to the original estimate 

these new plants will increase our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville improve our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location and allow us to benefit from the cost advantages of north american natural gas the projects continue to progress onschedule with anticipated start up dates of the third quarter 2015 for urea fourth quarter 

cf industries holdings inc 

2015 for uan and early 2016 for ammonia at donaldsonville louisiana port neal is scheduled to start up mid2016 for ammonia and in the third quarter of 2016 for urea 

we expect to finance expenditures for the capacity expansion projects through available cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and borrowings total cash spent to date on capitalized expenditures for the capacity expansion projects was 18 billion  including 13 billion  in 2014  in addition 2443 million  was invested in the capacity expansion projects and not paid as of december 31 2014  and recognized as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

we have retained engineering and procurement services from an affiliate of thyssenkrupp industrial solutions thyssenkrupp formerly thyssenkrupp uhde for both the donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa capacity expansion projects under the terms of the engineering and procurement services contract we have granted thyssenkrupp a security interest in a restricted cash account and maintain a cash balance in that account equal to the cancellation fees for procurement services and equipment that would arise if we were to cancel the projects the amount in the account will change over time based on procurement costs as of december 31 2014  there was 861 million  held in this account this restricted cash is excluded from our cash and cash equivalents and reported separately on our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows 

capital spending 

we make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements capital expenditures totaled 18085 million  in 2014  as compared to 8238 million  in 2013  the increase  in capital expenditures is primarily the result of the 13 billion  spent on the two capacity expansion projects discussed above 

projected capital spending 

we expect capital expenditures in 2015  to be approximately 20 billion  to 25 billion  including 15 billion  to 20 billion  for the capacity expansion projects and 05 billion  of sustaining and other capital expenditures planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting unanticipated increases in cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties 

disposition of phosphate business and ammonia supply agreements 

in october 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with mosaic to sell our entire phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was located in florida for a purchase price of approximately 14 billion in cash and entered into two agreements to supply ammonia to mosaic the first agreement which is not conditioned upon completion of the phosphate business sale transaction provides for us to supply between 600000 and 800000 tons of ammonia per year from our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex beginning no later than 2017 the second agreement provides for us to supply approximately 300000 tons of ammonia per year sourced from our plnl joint venture which began at the closing of the phosphate business sale transaction 

in 2014 we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business and recognized pretax and aftertax gains on the sale of the phosphate business of 7501 million and 4628 million respectively under the terms of the purchase agreement the accounts receivable and accounts payable pertaining to the phosphate mining and manufacturing business and certain phosphate inventory held in distribution facilities were not sold to mosaic in the transaction and were settled in the ordinary course 

the phosphate mining and manufacturing business assets we sold in the transaction include the hardee county phosphate rock mine the plant city phosphate complex an ammonia terminal phosphate warehouse and dock at the port of tampa and the site of the former bartow phosphate complex in addition mosaic assumed certain liabilities related to the phosphate mining and manufacturing business including responsibility for closure water treatment and longterm maintenance and monitoring of the phosphogypsum stacks at the plant city and bartow complexes mosaic also received the value of the phosphate mining and manufacturing business asset retirement obligation trust and escrow funds totaling approximately 200 million the assets and liabilities sold to mosaic were classified as held for sale as of december 31 2013 therefore no depreciation depletion or amortization was recorded in 2014 for the related property plant and equipment

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

we have operations in canada and interests in corporate joint ventures in the united kingdom the republic of trinidad and tobago and switzerland the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us are recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings are recognized unless the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested based upon our current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurs at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings can occur in different periods cash balances held by corporate joint ventures are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint ventures on a periodic basis 

as of december 31 2014  approximately 3440 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 20 billion  was held by our canadian subsidiaries the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represents accumulated earnings of our foreign operations which is not considered to be permanently reinvested we have recognized deferred income taxes on these earnings for the foreign and domestic taxes that would be due upon their repatriation to the united states as of december 31 2014  the cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian cash balances would be approximately 172 million

forward sales and customer advances 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose we also often use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers because we often use derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives additionally our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had 3254 million  and 1206 million  respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets 

while customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances could likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase additionally borrowing under our credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity 

under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales 

derivative financial instruments 

we often use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies and in most cases the use of international swaps and derivatives association isda master netting arrangements 

the isda master netting arrangements to most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 471 million  and 02 million  respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 587 million mmbtus and 763 million  mmbtus respectively as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the notional amount of our open foreign currency derivatives was 2528 million  and 6363 million  respectively none  of these open foreign currency derivatives were designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes 

other liquidity requirements 

we contributed 204 million  to our pension plans in 2014  we expect to contribute approximately 190 million  to our pension plans in 2015

cash flows 

operating activities 

year ended december 31 2014  compared to year ended december 31 2013   

net cash provided by operating activities  in 2014  was 14 billion  as compared to 15 billion  in 2013  the 582 million   decrease  in net cash provided by operating activities resulted from lower  earnings from core operating activities partially offset by favorable  working capital changes during 2014  as compared to 2013  the lower  earnings from core operating activities were primarily a result of the 7417 million  decline in gross margin partially offsetting the decline in gross margin 6386 million   less  was invested in net working capital than in 2013  improvements in working capital during 2014 were due to a combination of higher customer advances lower inventory levels and lower amounts paid for income taxes in 2014 as compared in 2013 customer advances are higher in anticipation of a busy spring 2015 application season combined with tighter north american nitrogen fertilizer supply compared to the prior year period 

year ended december 31 2013  compared to year ended december 31 2012   

net cash provided by operating activities  in 2013  was 15 billion  as compared to 24 billion  in 2012  the 09 billion   decline  was due to the combination of a 3906 million   decline  in net earnings and a higher  level of net working capital invested in the business in 2013  versus 2012  during 2013  7402 million   more  was invested in net working capital than in 2012  due primarily to higher income tax payments and lower customer advances as customers delayed purchasing decisions in 2013  as compare in 2012  

investing activities 

years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012   

net cash used in investing activities  was 3435 million  in 2014  compared to 10193 million  in 2013  cash used in investing activities in 2014  included 18 billion  on capital expenditures partially offset by the proceeds of 14 billion  we received from the sale of the phosphate business cash used in investing activities in 2013  included 8238 million  in capital expenditures and 1540 million  transferred to a restricted cash account in support of the capacity expansion projects discussed previously the 5135 million  cash used in investing activities in 2012  was primarily for capital expenditures partially offset by 654 million from the sale of shortterm securities and property plant and equipment additions to property plant and equipment accounted for 18085 million  8238 million  and 5235 million  of cash used in investing activities in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the increases in capital expenditures in 2014  and 2013  related primarily to cash spending for the major capacity expansion projects at our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa facilities 

financing activities 

years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012   

net cash used in financing activities  was 7751 million  in 2014  compared to 9803 million  in 2013  and 7968 million  in 2012  in both 2014  and 2013  we issued senior notes and received proceeds of approximately 15 billion cash used in financing activities in 2013 included 9187 million  to acquire the noncontrolling interests in cfl cash used for share repurchases in 2014  2013  and 2012  was 19 billion  14 billion  and 5000 million  respectively we distributed 460 million  to the noncontrolling interests in 2014  compared to 737 million  in 2013  and 2318 million  in 2012  the decrease in distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2014 and 2013 as compared to 2012 was due to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in cfl in april 2013 and the modifications to cfl selling prices in the fourth quarter of 2012 which impacted the payments made in the first four months of 2013 in 2012  130 million  was used for the repayment of longterm debt

in january 2015 we repurchased 04 million  of the companys common shares for 1272 million  as part of the 10 billion  share repurchase program announced in the third quarter of 2014 see note 19—stockholders equity  together with the 14 million  shares repurchased during 2014 these repurchases bring the total repurchased shares to date under this program to 18 million  for an aggregate expenditure of 5000 million  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer the rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from two  to ten years  and the barge charter commitments range from two  to seven years  we also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system some of which contain minimum throughput requirements the storage agreements contain minimum terms generally ranging from one  to three years  and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party see note 23—leases  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information concerning leases 

we do not have any other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap us gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciation and amortization are computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation and amortization expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews 

scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized in property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher depreciation and amortization costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors 

cf industries holdings inc 

turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line entitled additions to property plant and equipment 

inventory valuation 

we review our inventory account balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine whether the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our most recent estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales 

asset retirement obligations 

asset retirement obligations aros are legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value we have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2014  dollars is 510 million  we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros as of december 31 2014  because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion 

for additional information see note 21—asset retirement obligations  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating rates operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review 

the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired we review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates annually to determine if there is a loss in value of the investment we determine the fair value of the investment using an income approach valuation method if the sum of the expected future discounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized immediately 

our joint venture investment in trinidad and tobago operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method and continues to generate positive income and cash flow the financial results are included in the information in note 10—equity method investments  to the consolidated financial statements the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments in 2014 due to major maintenance activities being conducted at natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and 

cf industries holdings inc 

development activity in trinidad and tobago these curtailments are expected to continue into 2015 and it is unclear if they will continue beyond that time natural gas exploration activities in trinidad and tobago are being conducted and publiclyreported results indicate that additional natural gas will be available in the future however commitments from ngc regarding the level of future availability and the related cost are not available the future availability and cost of natural gas represents a significant assumption in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing the book value of our joint venture investment in trinidad and tobago at december 31 2014 that was subject to impairment review was 3633 million  no impairment was recognized in 2014 2013 or 2012 related to this investment 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the ammonia granular urea uan and other segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2014  2013  or 2012 reviews as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the carrying value of our goodwill was 21 billion  

derivative financial instruments 

the accounting for the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and whether the instrument is effective as part of a hedging relationship changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments considered effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as the changes occur and are reclassified into income or expense as the hedge item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as the changes occur 

certain of our foreign currency derivatives that we use to manage our exposure to changes in exchange rates on eurodenominated expenditures associated with our major capacity expansion projects have been designated as cash flow hedges the expected cash flows for the capital projects involve the use of judgments and estimates which are subject to change we assess both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the designated cash flow hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable hedge accounting is discontinued in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting 

income taxes 

we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period when these changes occur 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

a deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that are considered to not be permanently reinvested no 

cf industries holdings inc 

deferred income tax liability is recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested 

as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods 

we operate in a number of countries and as a result have a significant amount of cross border transactions the taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators in countries across the globe including the countries in which we operate the tax rules and regulations within the various countries in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various countries as a result there are instances where regulators within the countries involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances we work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions however there are instances where reaching a common understanding is not possible or practical as of december 31 2014 we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits including penalties and interest of 1604 million which is related predominantly to certain potential tax exposures involving cross border transactions this amount represents our best estimate of the amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions differences in interpretation of the tax laws including agreements between governments surrounding our cross border transactions can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimates 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 7878 million  as of december 31 2014  which was 1230 million  higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2014  pbo was computed based on a weightedaverage discount rate of 40  which was based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 521 million  higher or 469 million  lower respectively than the amount previously discussed 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2014  was 48  if the discount rate used to compute 2014  pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 40 million  higher or 05 million  lower respectively than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 55  weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on assets used to calculate pension expense in 2014  is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2014  would have been 33 million  lower or higher respectively see note 13—pension and other postretirement benefits  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further discussion of our pension plans 

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest and use the equity method to account for investments in affiliates that we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies plus the amortization expense of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of purchase accounting our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investments includes considering key factors such as ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions we regularly review for variable interest entities regarding potential changes in consolidation status 

we eliminate from our consolidated financial results all significant intercompany transactions

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 3—new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

discussion of seasonality impacts on operations 

in north america the sales patterns of our major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices the valuation of our investments interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to fertilizer sales are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea and uan 32 by approximately 33 22 and 14 respectively 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments covering periods of generally less than 18 months the derivative instruments that we use currently are primarily natural gas options and natural gas fixed price swaps these derivatives settle using nymex futures price indexes which represent the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had open derivative contracts for 587 million  mmbtus and 763 million  mmbtus respectively a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas as of december 31 2014  would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of 271 million and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by 380 million 

from time to time we may purchase ammonia granular urea and uan on the open market to augment or replace production at our facilities 

interest rate fluctuations 

as of december 31 2014  we had six series of senior notes totaling 46 billion  outstanding with maturity dates of may 1 2018  may 1 2020  june 1 2023  march 15 2034  june 1 2043  and march 15 2044  the senior notes have fixed interest rates the fair value of our senior notes outstanding as of december 31 2014  was approximately 50 billion  borrowings under our credit agreement bear a current market rate of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings however in 2014  there were no borrowings under that agreement 

foreign currency exchange rates 

since the fourth quarter of 2012 we have entered into eurous dollar derivative hedging transactions related to the eurodenominated construction costs associated with our capacity expansion projects at our donaldsonville and port neal facilities as of december 31 2014  the notional amount of our open foreign currency forward contracts was approximately 2528 million  and the fair value was a net unrealized loss of 224 million  a 10 change in us dollareuro forward exchange rates would change the fair value of these positions by 253 million 

we are also directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the swiss franc we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

cf industries holdings inc 

we operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries inc now our whollyowned subsidiary were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock 

in april 2010 we acquired terra industries inc terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities our 753 interest in tnclp and certain joint venture interests 

operating segments 

our business is divided into two operating segments the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment the nitrogen segment includes the manufacture and sale of ammonia granular urea uan and an the phosphate segment includes the manufacture and sale of dap and map in october 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with mosaic to sell our entire phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida for additional details regarding this sale including the assumption of certain liabilities by mosaic see note 12—assets and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated financial statements

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in 2013 natural gas accounted for approximately 41 of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities have access to abundant competitivelypriced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities we have facilities located at or near henry hub in louisiana oneok in oklahoma aeco in alberta ventura in iowa and dawn in ontario 

our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consume in the aggregate in excess of 250 million mmbtus of natural gas annually we employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced supply of natural gas we also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices for further information about our natural gas hedging activities see note 24—derivative financial instruments 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the safe efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer to terminals warehouses and customers each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capability and location 

our north american production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the us and canada with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5400 tank and hopper cars as well as railcars provided by rail carriers 

the north american waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our donaldsonville verdigris and yazoo city facilities we employ a fleet of ten leased tow boats and 32 river barges to ship ammonia and uan we also utilize contract marine services to move urea and phosphate fertilizers 

three of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia the donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2000mile long nustar pipeline through which we transport ammonia to more than 20 terminals and shipping points in the midwestern us corn belt our verdigris and port neal facilities are connected to the 1100mile long magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the us midwest 

phosphate segment

our phosphate fertilizer manufacturing operations are located in central florida and consist of a phosphate fertilizer chemical complex in plant city a phosphate rock mine a beneficiation plant and phosphate rock reserves in hardee county and a deepwater terminal facility in the port of tampa we own each of these facilities and properties 

cf industries holdings inc 

the following table summarizes our phosphate fertilizer production volumes for the last three years and current production capacities for phosphaterelated products 



1 p 2 o 5 is the basic measure of the nutrient content in phosphate fertilizer products 2 capacities shown for phosphate rock at the hardee county phosphate rock mine and dapmap granulation at the plant city facility are constrained by plant citys capacity to produce phosphoric acid 

hardee county phosphate rock mine 

in 1975 we purchased 20000 acres of land in hardee county florida that was originally estimated to contain in excess of 100 million tons of recoverable rock reserves between 1978 and 1993 we operated a one million ton per year phosphate rock mine on a 5000acre portion of these reserves in 1995 we began operations at an expanded mine on the remaining 15000acre area of the reserve property since that time we have acquired additional rock reserves through acquisitions or exchanges of several smaller parcels of land 

the table below shows the estimated reserves at the hardee phosphate complex as of december 31 2013 also reflected in the table is the grade of the reserves expressed as a percentage of bone phosphate of lime bpl and p 2 o 5  the table also reflects the average values of the following material contaminants contained in the reserves ferrous oxide fe 2 o 3  plus aluminum oxide al 2 o 3  and magnesium oxide mgo 

proven and probable reserves 1 as of december 31 2013 



1 the minimum drill hole density for the proven reserves classification is 1 hole per 20 acres 2 the reserve estimates provided have been developed by the company in accordance with industry guide 7 promulgated by the sec we estimate that 99 of the reserves are proven 

our phosphate reserve estimates are based on geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff geologist as of december 31 2013 reserve estimates are updated periodically to reflect actual 

cf industries holdings inc 

phosphate rock recovered new drilling information and other geological or mining data estimates for 99 of the reserves are based on 20acre density drilling 

plant city phosphate complex 

our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in north america at one million tons per year its phosphoric acid capacity represents approximately 10 of the total us capacity all of plant citys phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates dap and map representing approximately 13 of us capacity for ammonium phosphate fertilizer products in 2013 the combination of the plant city phosphate fertilizer complex and the hardee mine gives us one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in north america 

bartow phosphate complex 

we own a site in bartow florida on which we operated a phosphate manufacturing complex this complex ceased production in 1999 and the former manufacturing facilities have been dismantled and disposed of in accordance with local laws and regulations the related phosphogypsum stack has been closed and the former storage and distribution facilities were sold along with excess land we continue to be obligated for the closure of the cooling pond management of water treatment on the site and providing longterm care for the site in accordance with regulatory requirements 

phosphate raw materials 

phosphate rock supply phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers approximately 35 tons of phosphate rock are needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5 the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex typically consumes in excess of three million tons of rock annually as of december 31 2013 our hardee rock mine had approximately 11 years of fully permitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our hardee property where we can mine the expanded area has an estimated 353 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves we estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area 

sulfur supply sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid approximately three quarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5  our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 800000 long tons of sulfur annually when operating at capacity we obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration in 2013 martin sulphur our largest molten sulfur supplier supplied approximately 63 of the molten sulfur used at plant city 

ammonia supply dap and map have a nitrogen content of 18 and 11 respectively and a phosphate nutrient content of 46 and 52 respectively ammonia is the primary source of nitrogen in dap and map operating at capacity our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex consumes approximately 400000 tons of ammonia annually 

the ammonia used at our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia storage facility located in tampa florida this facility consists of a 38000ton ammonia storage tank access to a deepwater dock that is capable of discharging oceangoing vessels and rail and truck loading facilities in addition to supplying our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex our tampa ammonia distribution system has the capacity to support ammonia sales to and distribution 

cf industries holdings inc 

services for other customers sales of ammonia from our tampa terminal are reported in our nitrogen business segment the ammonia supply for tampa is purchased from offshore sources providing us with access to the broad international ammonia market 

phosphate distribution 

we operate a phosphate fertilizer warehouse located at a deepwater port facility in tampa florida most of the phosphate fertilizer produced at plant city is shipped by truck or rail to our tampa warehouse where it is loaded onto vessels for shipment to export customers or for transport across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river in 2013 our tampa warehouse handled approximately 12 million tons of phosphate fertilizers or about 66 of our production the remainder of our phosphate fertilizer production is transported by truck or rail directly to customers or to inmarket storage facilities 

phosphate fertilizer shipped across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river is transferred into river barges near new orleans phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is transported to our storage facilities or delivered directly to customers river transportation is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators 

storage facilities and other properties 

at december 31 2013 we owned or leased space at 85 inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 20state region and canada including storage at our production facilities and at the tampa warehouse and ammonia terminal we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately three million tons of fertilizer our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table 



1 capacity is expressed as the equivalent volume of uan measured on a 32 nitrogen content basis 2 our dry products include urea dap and map 3 our lease agreements are typically for periods of one to three years 

customers 

the principal customers for our nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors none of our customers in 2013 accounted for more than ten percent of our consolidated net sales sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force 

cf industries holdings inc 

competition 

our markets are global and intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

in our nitrogen segment our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium inc and koch nitrogen company there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition from foreignsourced products continuously 

in our phosphate segment our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium mosaic potash corporation of saskatchewan inc and jr simplot company the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and are dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer andor trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations 

seasonality 

the sales patterns of our six major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns

environmental health and safety expenditures 

our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2013 totaled approximately 415 million in 2014 we estimate that we will spend approximately 383 million for environmental health and safety capital expenditures environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

clean air act—section 185 fee

federal and state numeric nutrient criteria regulation 

on august 18 2009 the epa entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court judge on november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the federal district court court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious 

subsequently the florida department of environmental protection fdep adopted its own nitrogen and phosphorous criteria for surface waters and related implementation standards on november 30 2012 the epa approved floridas nutrient criteria and on june 27 2013 the epa approved new water quality standards submitted by the fdep relating to the scope of coverage of the fdeps numeric nutrient criteria for surface waters on january 7 2014 the us district court for the northern district of florida granted the epas motion to amend the 2009 consent decree as a result the epa is no longer required by the consent decree to promulgate numeric nitrogen and phosphorous criteria for certain surface waters that the fdep had determined were more properly regulated by the states narrative standard the courts order allows the epa to withdraw its federal numeric nutrient criteria after which the fdeps regulations will become effective 

the 2009 consent decree also required the epa to develop numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters although the epa proposed such criteria in 2012 the fdep submitted to the epa new numeric nutrient water quality standards for those waters on july 31 and august 1 2013 on september 26 2013 the epa approved floridas new and revised nutrient water quality standards for estuaries and coastal waters and informed the court that as a result it was not required to finalize the federal criteria that it had proposed 

there is continuing regulatory uncertainty because the epas approval of the fdep nutrient water quality standards is still subject to challenge nonetheless numeric nutrient water quality criteria for florida waters whether federal or state could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining manufacturing and distribution operations in florida more stringent limits on wastewater discharge permits could increase our costs and limit our operations and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

regulation of greenhouse gases 

we are subject to regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states concerning greenhouse gas ghg emissions 

the united kingdom is a party to the kyoto protocol as a result of agreements reached during a conference in durban south africa in 2011 the kyoto protocol will continue in force for a second commitment period which will expire by 2020 to be replaced by another international agreement to be negotiated by 2015 which agreement is to go into effect in 2020 the united kingdom has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas trading system our joint venture uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require the joint venture to purchase co 2 emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our joint venture uk sites are also subject to the european union emissions trading scheme 

cf industries holdings inc 

in canada which in december 2011 withdrew from further participation in the kyoto protocol but signed the durban platform to negotiate a new international ghg agreement or protocol by 2015 we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canadas national pollutant release inventory and ontarios mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation ontario is also a party to the western climate initiative comprised of california and several canadian provinces parties to the western climate initiative are working to create a regional program linking the cap and trade emissions programs of its members although ontario has not disavowed its participation in the initiative it has not developed regulations to establish a cap and trade program 

in the united states not a party to the kyoto protocol but a signatory to the durban platform with respect to the negotiation of a replacement for the kyoto protocol ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels the epa has issued federal ghg regulations that impact our facilities including a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in may 2010 the epa issued the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule pursuant to this regulation the construction of new or modification of existing major sources of ghg emissions became subject to the psd air permitting program and later the title v permitting program in january 2011 and the regulation could significantly decrease the emissions thresholds that would subject facilities to these regulations in the future the united states supreme court has accepted a petition for certiorari entertaining certain challenges to the epas regulation of ghgs from new and modified emissions sources and a decision in this case is expected by june 2014 regulation of ghg emissions pursuant to the psd program could subject new capital projects to additional permitting requirements that may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects 

under the title v provisions of the tailoring rule all of our us manufacturing facilities will be required to include ghg emissions in future title v air permit applications other than the states implementation of the tailoring rule none of the states where our us production facilities are located—florida louisiana mississippi iowa and oklahoma—has proposed control regulations limiting ghg emissions 

revisions to new source performance standards for nitric acid plants 

we operate 13 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides no x  notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas 

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and mining permits authorizing operations at our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals

in october 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with mosaic to sell our entire phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida for additional details regarding this sale including the assumption by mosaic of certain liabilities such as the closure and longterm maintenance costs of our phosphogypsum stack systems see note 12—assets and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated financial statements the sale is expected to close in the first half of 2014 as of december 31 2013 the area permitted for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 385 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which we expect to meet our requirements at current production rates for approximately 11 years we have secured the necessary permits to mine these reserves from the fdep and the us army corps of engineers we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated additional 353 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which we expect will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area the estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective of the anticipated permittable mining areas based on recent similar permitting efforts in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

with the completion of our recent phosphogypsum stack expansion project this stack has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits including additional expansion phases the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this date is approximately six years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in certain cases as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities we currently utilize a trust established for the benefit of the epa and the fdep and an escrow account established for the benefit of the fdep as a means of complying with financial assurance requirements for the closure and longterm care of our phosphogypsum stack systems for additional information on the cash deposit arrangements see note 10—asset retirement obligations 

several of our permits including our mining permit at the hardee phosphate complex require us to reclaim any property disturbed by our operations at our hardee property we currently mine approximately 300 to 500 acres of land each year all of which must be reclaimed the costs to reclaim this land vary based on the type of land involved and range from 4700 to 19600 an acre with an average of 12200 an acre for additional information on our hardee asset retirement obligations see note 10—asset retirement obligations 

our phosphate operations in florida are subject to regulations governing the closure and longterm maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the site of our former bartow phosphate complex we estimate that we will spend a total of approximately 5 million between 2014 and 2016 to complete closure of the cooling pond and channels water treating expenditures at bartow

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is dependent on north american natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our nitrogen fertilizers 

the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2013 the average daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america reached a low of 308 per mmbtu on january 11 2013 and a high of 452 per mmbtu on december 24 2013 during the three year period ended december 31 2013 the average daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 492 per mmbtu on june 9 2011 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012 

changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

north american prices have declined over the last several years in response to increased supply from the development of production from shale gas formations future production of natural gas from shale gas formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or increase its cost for other reasons if this were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade 

periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacity 

during periods of industry oversupply our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production 

cf industries holdings inc 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities 

some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships 

china the worlds largest producer and consumer of fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability if chinese government policy or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourages exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

russia and ukraine have significant capacity to produce and export nitrogen fertilizers and producers in these countries continue to pay belowmarket prices for natural gas due to ongoing government intervention in natural gas pricing competition in the united states with imports of solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia and ukraine is currently subject to the discipline imposed by us antidumping duty orders which require such imports to be priced at or above fair value when sold in the us market the antidumping orders have affected the pricing of these imports and have also restrained the volumes imported however if there were to be significant decreases in the antidumping duty rates applied to most russian and ukrainian exporters we could face much higher volumes of lower priced russian and ukrainian urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate in the united states the russian and ukrainian solid urea antidumping orders are expected to remain in place until at least december 2016 the russian ammonium nitrate order is currently scheduled to remain in place until at least august 2016 the ukrainian ammonium nitrate order is expected to remain in place until at least june 2018 

a decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products 

conditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control 

state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand in part due to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels this increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics 

cf industries holdings inc 

while the current renewable fuels standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to allow increased ethanol imports and to eliminate the fuel mandate either of which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand in november 2013 the epa proposed to reduce the renewable fuels volumes required for calendar year 2014 to around current consumption levels developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment 

our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposure to liability 

we rely on railroad trucking pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products 

if shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads have implemented tariffs that include provisions that purport to shift liability to shippers to the extent that liabilities arise from third parties with insufficient resources these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products 

our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these 

cf industries holdings inc 

hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled plant downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage 

in april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility we have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed in 2013 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our product to west fertilizer co products we have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident based on the initial analysis of the pending lawsuits we believe that we have strong legal and factual defenses to the claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in the pending lawsuits and any other claims brought against us in connection with the incident in addition the increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilities 

cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results 

as we continue to increase our dependence on information technologies to conduct our operations the risks associated with cyber security also increase we rely on management information systems among other things to manage our accounting manufacturing supply chain and financial functions this risk not only applies to us but also to third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our information from being vulnerable to theft loss damage or interruption from a number of potential sources or events we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate prevent or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks compromises to our information systems could have severe financial and other business implications 

cf industries holdings inc 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations 

weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen based fertilizers colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for residential and industrial use in addition hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise 

we may not be able to complete our capacity expansion projects on schedule as planned on budget or at all due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

on november 1 2012 we announced that we will construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our complex in donaldsonville louisiana and new ammonia and urea units at our complex in port neal iowa our board of directors has authorized expenditures of 38 billion for the projects total invested on these projects through december 31 2013 was 6805 million 

the design development construction and startup of the new plants are subject to a number of risks any of which could prevent us from completing the projects on schedule as planned and on budget or at all including cost overruns performance of third parties permitting matters adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor and raw material shortages transportation constraints engineering and construction change orders and other unforeseen difficulties 

the donaldsonville and port neal expansion projects are dependent on the availability and performance of the engineering firms construction firms equipment suppliers transportation providers and other vendors necessary to build the new units on a timely basis and on acceptable economic terms if any of the third parties fails to perform as we expect our ability to meet our expansion goals would be affected 

our expansion plans may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences such as the diversion of managements attention from our existing plants and businesses and other opportunities 

other expansions of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both domestically and in foreign locations major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments require significant managerial resources which may be diverted from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize 

cf industries holdings inc 

our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws regulations and permitting requirements as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act rcra cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes 

as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations additionally future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures additionally our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses 

our operations are dependent on numerous required permits approvals and meeting financial assurance requirements from governmental authorities 

we hold numerous environmental mining and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion of our operations is dependent upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an 

cf industries holdings inc 

existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in certain cases as a condition to procure such permits and approvals or as a condition to maintain existing approvals we may be required to comply with regulatory financial assurance requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure local state or federal government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care and reclamation at our facilities for example we have funded an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection fdep as a means of complying with floridas regulations governing financial assurance related to closure and postclosure of phosphogypsum stacks also pursuant to a consent decree with the us epa and the fdep we have funded a trust as a means of complying with similar requirements for closure post closure and monitoring of the phosphogypsum stack system at our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex 

florida regulations also mandate payment of certain mining taxes based on the quantity of ore mined and are subject to change based on local regulatory approvals additional financial assurance requirements or other increases in local mining regulations and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

florida regulations also require phosphate rock mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities the demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds letters of credit insurance policies or similar instruments it is possible that we will not be able to comply with either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

as of december 31 2013 the area permitted by local state and federal authorities for mining at our hardee phosphate complex contained approximately 385 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current operating rates for approximately 11 years we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated 353 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue or expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have secured the state environmental authorization to increase the capacity of our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city the phase ii expansion project was completed in july 2013 and will provide sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits including further expansion phases the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding construction and operating permits this time frame is approximately five years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our 

cf industries holdings inc 

hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to greenhouse gas ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have significant impacts on the fertilizer industry due to the fact that our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states or canada our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us 

our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season 

if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are particularly acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns causing an adverse change in operating results 

a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose this improves our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allows us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing assets 

cf industries holdings inc 

under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date thereby significantly increasing our liquidity any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as of december 31 2013 and 2012 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders equaled approximately 7 and 17 respectively of our cash and cash equivalents 

we believe the ability to purchase product on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

we also sell phosphate products on a forward basis in 2013 forward sales of phosphate fertilizer products represented approximately 14 of our phosphate fertilizer volume unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products where we have the opportunity to fix or cap the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to do the same for the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate fertilizer costs as a result we are typically exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis 

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses 

we manage the risk of changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates using derivative instruments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes involving commodity price volatility adverse correlation of commodity prices or market liquidity issues 

in order to manage financial exposure to commodity price and market fluctuations we often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen based fertilizers we have used fixedprice forward physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist 

our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or for which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties thereby negatively impacting our liquidity 

in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large 

cf industries holdings inc 

financial institutions we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties established credit limits cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on derivative settlements 

we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities 

our nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in seven separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represents approximately 40 of the companys ammonia production capacity our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on our phosphate mine and associated beneficiation plant in hardee county florida our phosphate fertilizer complex in plant city florida and our ammonia terminal in tampa florida the suspension of operations at any of these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a number of our key facilities including the donaldsonville complex and all of our phosphate operations are located in regions of the united states that experience a relatively high level of hurricane activity such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas and sulfur in the gulf of mexico region 

we are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventures 

we participate in joint ventures including point lisas which owns a facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago growhow which owns facilities in billingham and ince united kingdom and keytrade a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near zurich switzerland our joint venture partners may share a measure of control over the operations of our joint ventures as a result our investments in joint ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our joint ventures or our partners have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions requests policies or objectives subject the joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business 

in addition we may become involved in disputes with our joint venture partners which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities our plants and ancillary facilities may be targets of terrorist activities many of these plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cf industries holdings inc 

in addition due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives local state federal and foreign governments could implement new regulations impacting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives it is possible that the us or foreign governments could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that such illicit use of our products could result in liability for the company 

our operations and those of our joint ventures are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and an increase in the price or any delay or interruption in the delivery of these raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we and our joint ventures use natural gas ammonia and sulfur as raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase these raw materials from thirdparty suppliers prices for these raw materials can fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand we may not be able to pass along to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business these products are transported by barge truck rail or pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint ventures by thirdparty transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw materials including those caused by capacity constraints explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving pipelines deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime or labor difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations 

our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions during 2013 we derived approximately 18 of our net sales from outside of the united states our business operations include our nitrogen fertilizer complex in medicine hat alberta our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in courtright ontario a 50 interest in an ammonia production joint venture in trinidad a 50 interest in a uk joint venture for the production of anhydrous ammonia and other fertilizer products and a 50 interest in a fertilizer trading operation headquartered near zurich switzerland 

our investments in securities are subject to risks that may result in losses 

our cash flows from operations have resulted in cash and cashequivalents of approximately 17 billion as of december 31 2013 we generally invest these cash and cash equivalents in what we believe to be relatively shortterm highly liquid and high credit quality instruments including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us government those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities our investments are subject to fluctuations in both market value and yield based upon changes in 

cf industries holdings inc 

market conditions including interest rates liquidity general economic and credit market conditions and conditions specific to the issuers 

due to the risks of investments we may not achieve expected returns or may realize losses on our investments which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could impact the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories the overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted 

in addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizer significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact on the importation of fertilizers foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 

we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness or need to refinance existing indebtedness in the future which may adversely affect our operations 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 31 billion of total indebtedness consisting primarily of senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2018 and 2043 we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing revolving credit facility of approximately 9951 million the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future our existing indebtedness and any additional debt we may incur in the future could have negative consequences on our business should operating cash flows be insufficient to cover debt service which would adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

from time to time we consider our options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the loss of key members of our management and professional staff may adversely affect our business 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our senior management and professional staff the loss of one or more key personnel could have a material 

cf industries holdings inc 

adverse effect on our results of operations additionally if we are unable to find hire and retain needed key personnel in the future our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to risk associated with the strategic agreements that we entered into with the mosaic company including the risk that we may not be able to complete the sale of our phosphate business to the mosaic company as planned or at all due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

in october 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with the mosaic company mosaic to sell our entire phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida and entered into two agreements to supply ammonia to mosaic the first agreement which is not conditioned upon completion of the phosphate business sale transaction provides for us to supply between 600000 and 800000 tons of ammonia per year from our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex beginning no later than 2017 the second agreement provides for us to supply approximately 300000 tons of ammonia per year sourced from our point lisas nitrogen limited plnl joint venture beginning at the closing of the phosphate business sale transaction mosaic is assuming certain liabilities related to the phosphate mining and manufacturing and we will transfer to mosaic the value of our asset retirement obligation trust and escrow funds the phosphate business sale transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2014 

the closing of the phosphate business sale transaction is subject to various conditions including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 hsr act approvals under applicable foreign antitrust laws receipt of other governmental and third party consents and other customary closing conditions in january 2014 we were notified that the us department of justice closed its review and terminated the waiting period under the hsr act relating to the phosphate business sale transaction if these conditions are not satisfied or waived to the extent permitted by law the closing of the phosphate sale transaction may be delayed or may not occur further disruptions related to the proposed transactions with mosaic could harm our relationships with our customers employees or suppliers

cfl selling price modifications 

prior to april 30 2013 cf industries inc cf industries owned 49 of the voting common shares and 66 of the nonvoting preferred shares of canadian fertilizers limited cfl an alberta canada based nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer and had the right to purchase 66 of the production of cfl also prior to april 30 2013 viterra inc viterra held 34 of the equity ownership of cfl and had the right to purchase up to 34 of cfls production both cf industries and viterra were entitled to receive distributions of net earnings of cfl based upon their respective purchases from cfl cfl was a variable interest entity that was consolidated in our financial statements on april 30 2013 cf industries completed the acquisitions of all of the outstanding interests in cfl that it did not already own and cfl became our wholly owned subsidiary 

cf industries holdings inc 

cf industries and viterras purchases of nitrogen fertilizer products from cfl were made under product purchase agreements and the selling prices were determined under the provisions of these agreements an initial selling price was paid to cfl based upon cfls production cost plus an agreedupon margin once title passed as the product was shipped at the end of the year the difference between the market price of products purchased from cfl and the price based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin was paid to cfl the sales revenue attributable to this difference was accrued by the company on an interim basis until april 30 2013 when cfl became a wholly owned subsidiary in our financial statements net sales and accounts receivable attributable to cfl were solely generated by transactions with viterra as all transactions with cf industries were eliminated in consolidation in our financial statements 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 the cfl board of directors approved amendments to the product purchase agreements retroactive to january 1 2012 that modified the selling prices that cfl charged for products sold to viterra and cf industries which eliminated the requirement to pay to cfl the difference between the market price and the price based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin the following summarizes the selling prices in the product purchase agreements that impacted the companys results due to sales transactions to viterra both before and after the effective date of the amendment 

• for the 2011 annual reporting period the companys consolidated financial statements reflect marketbased selling prices for products purchased from cfl including sales made by cfl to viterra • for the 2012 annual reporting period and between the period of january 1 2013 and april 30 2013 cfl selling prices were based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin • starting on april 30 2013 cfl became a wholly owned subsidiary of cf industries once cfl became a wholly owned subsidiary cf industries began purchasing all of the output of cfl for resale and reported those sales in its consolidated financial statements at market prices as a result the financial results for 2013 include four months of selling prices based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin and eight months of market based selling prices these selling price amendments to the product purchase agreements impact the comparability of the companys financial results these changes affect the yearoveryear comparability of net sales gross margin operating earnings earnings before income taxes and net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest but do not impact the comparability of the companys net earnings attributable to common stockholders or net cash flows for the same period

net operating loss nol settlement 

at the time of our initial public offering ipo in 2005 we had accumulated a substantial amount of nols due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefit from the nols when we ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for income tax purposes and became a public company a full valuation allowance was recorded against the benefit of those nols at that time we entered into an agreement nol agreement with the preipo owners under which they would benefit should any of the preipo nols be realized in future years by using the nols to offset postipo taxable income if this were to occur we would pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved at december 31 2012 the nols had a potential tax benefit of 943 million which had been fully reserved by the valuation allowance 

in january 2013 we and the preipo owners amended the nol agreement to provide among other things that we would be entitled to retain 269 of any settlement realized and 731 would be payable to them 

in march 2013 we entered into a closing agreement with the irs to resolve the tax treatment of the preipo nols pursuant to the closing agreement we have agreed with the irs that we will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to a portion of the nols over five years commencing with the 2012 tax year the 206 million net benefit from this nol settlement was recognized in the first quarter of 2013 as follows 

• nol tax benefits of 758 million were recognized which reduced income tax expense • a charge of 552 million was recognized for the 731 portion of the nol benefit that will be paid to the preipo owners as the tax benefits are realized the 552 million charge is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in other nonoperating—net financial executive summary 

• during 2013 we experienced lower net sales and net earnings as compared to the prior year due to weakness in the global fertilizer markets the lower earnings were due primarily to lower selling prices for both nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and higher natural gas costs as compared to the prior year the decline in global nitrogen selling prices was attributable to increased supply due primarily to higher exports from china the decline in phosphate selling prices reflected weaker demand from india • in 2013 we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 15 billion compared to net earnings of 18 billion in 2012 or a decline of 21 our 2013 results included 529 million of pretax unrealized marktomarket gains 335 million after tax on natural gas derivatives and 208 million of realized and unrealized net gains 132 million after tax on foreign currency derivatives related to our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa and a net 206 million benefit from a settlement with the irs concerning certain preipo nols 42

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our agricultural products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

cf industries holdings inc 

global supply  demand 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key consumingexporting countries such as china india and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs availability of raw materials government policies and global trade 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan and an because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america declined over the past several years but are subject to volatility during the three year period ended december 31 2013 the average daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 492 per mmbtu on june 9 2011 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012 natural gas costs rose 8 in 2013 from 2012 expenditures on natural gas including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 41 of the total cost of sales for our nitrogen fertilizer products in 2013 up from 39 in 2012 natural gas costs represented a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization 

farmers economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns and the types of crops planted 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

cf industries holdings inc 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the middle east ukraine republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa and china are major exporters to north america 

the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer and trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations 

political and social government policies 

the political and social policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports the subsidization of natural gas prices the subsidization of domestic producers and the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives 

factors affecting our results 

net sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost we report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward sales and customer advances later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment volatility in quarterly reported earnings also may arise from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of derivatives 

selling general and administrative expenses our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees including those for corporate initiatives 

cf industries holdings inc 

other operating—net other operating—net includes the costs associated with engineering studies for proposed capital projects administrative costs associated with our capacity expansion projects and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations costs included in other costs can include foreign exchange gains and losses unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives costs associated with our closed facilities engineering studies amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates we have investments accounted for under the equity method for which the results are included in our operating earnings these consist of the following 1 50 ownership interest in plnl and 2 50 interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in houston texas we include our share of the net earnings from these investments as an element of earnings from operations because these investments provide additional production and storage capacity to our operations and are integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities in the nitrogen segment our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition 

interest expense our interest expense includes the interest on our longterm debt and notes payable amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements and annual fees on our senior revolving credit facility capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the facility along with all other construction costs 

interest income our interest income represents amounts earned on our cash cash equivalents investments and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 

income tax provision our income tax provision includes all currently payable and deferred united states and foreign income tax expense applicable to our ongoing operations 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the entities that we account for using the equity method and exclude from operating earnings income taxes related to these investments if any are reflected in this line the amounts recorded as equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes relate to our investments in growhow and keytrade our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition we account for these investments as nonoperating equity method investments and exclude the net earnings of these investments in earnings from operations since these operations do not provide additional production capacity to us nor are these operations integrated within our supply chain 

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest for 2013 and 2012 included the net earnings attributable to the 247 interest of the publicly held common units of tnclp net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest 

cf industries holdings inc 

for the first four months of 2013 and all of 2012 also included the interest of the 34 holder of cfls equity ownership on april 30 2013 we purchased the noncontrolling interests of cfl which is the primary reason for the 2013 decline in earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest

as discussed in the items affecting comparability of results section of this discussion and analysis in the fourth quarter of 2012 the cfl selling prices to viterra were modified to cost plus an 

cf industries holdings inc 

agreedupon margin from marketbased pricing retroactive to january 1 2012 this change had no impact on our net earnings attributable to common stockholders as cfl was a consolidated variable interest entity prior to april 30 2013 however these changes impact the comparability of certain amounts between 2013 and prior years on april 30 2013 cf industries acquired the noncontrolling interests in cfl and cfl became a wholly owned subsidiary of cf industries 

the financial results for 2013 include four months of cfl selling prices based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin and eight months of market based selling prices 

the following table adjusts the results for 2012 and 2011 to a similar selling price pattern of four months based on production costs and eight months based on market prices to be comparable to the 2013 results 



year ended december 31 2013 compared to year ended december 31 2012 

consolidated operating results 

net sales and net earnings for 2013 declined in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments from prior year levels these declines were due to increased supply and weakness in global fertilizer markets higher exports by chinese producers increased supply and weighed on global nitrogen prices while weaker demand from india had a similar impact on phosphate prices north american demand in 2013 for both nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers was impacted by a delayed fall application period due to a late harvest and a shortened application window due to adverse weather in the midwest additionally an 8 increase in realized natural gas costs contributed to lower earnings 

our gross margin decreased 5931 million or 19 to 25 billion in 2013 from 31 billion in 2012 reflecting declines in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments the gross margin was impacted by the cfl selling price modifications previously discussed on an as adjusted basis the gross margin decreased 22 from the prior year 

in the nitrogen segment the gross margin decreased by 4683 million or 16 to 24 billion as compared to 29 billion in 2012 due primarily to an 8 decrease in average selling prices an 8 increase in realized natural gas costs and a 136 million decrease in net unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in the current year as compared to 2012 the nitrogen segment gross margin was impacted by the cfl sales price modifications on an as adjusted basis the gross margin for the nitrogen segment decreased 20 

cf industries holdings inc 

in the phosphate segment gross margin decreased by 1248 million or 62 to 749 million in 2013 from 1997 million in 2012 due primarily to a 13 decline in average selling prices and a 9 decrease in volume 

net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 15 billion for 2013 included 529 million of pretax unrealized marktomarket gains 335 million after tax on natural gas derivatives and 208 million 132 million after tax of net realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency derivatives and a net 206 million benefit from a settlement with the irs concerning certain preipo nols net earnings in 2012 of 18 billion included 665 million of net pretax unrealized marktomarket gains 412 million after tax on natural gas derivatives 81 million 50 million after tax of net realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency derivatives a 152 million charge 94 million after tax for the accelerated amortization of deferred loan fees on our 2010 credit agreement that we replaced in may 2012 and a 109 million pretax curtailment gain 68 million after tax from a reduction in certain retiree medical benefits 

net sales 

net sales decreased 10 to 55 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 due to an 8 decrease in the nitrogen segment and a 21 decrease in the phosphate segment these results were impacted by the cfl selling price modifications on an as adjusted basis 2013 net sales decreased 12 compared to 2012 

in the nitrogen segment net sales decreased by 4188 million or 8 due primarily to an 8 decrease in average selling prices the decrease in prices was due primarily to increased supply from china and a shift in product mix from ammonia to uan the comparability of 2013 nitrogen segment net sales to prior years was impacted by the cfl sales price modifications on an as adjusted basis nitrogen segment net sales declined 11 from 2012 in the phosphate segment net sales declined 2105 million or 21 due to a 13 decrease in average selling prices and a 9 decrease in volume the decrease in prices was due primarily to lower global demand notably india 

cost of sales 

cost of sales decreased 362 million or 1 from 2012 to 2013 cost of sales per ton in our nitrogen segment averaged 172 in 2013 a 2 increase over a cost of sales per ton of 168 in 2012 the increase was due primarily to an 8 increase in realized natural gas costs and a 136 million decrease in net marktomarket gains related to natural gas derivatives phosphate segment cost of sales averaged 389 per ton in 2013 compared to 397 per ton in the prior year this 2 decrease was due primarily to reduced raw material costs namely ammonia and sulfur 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 142 million to 1660 million in 2013 from 1518 million in 2012 the increase was due primarily to higher corporate office costs including costs associated with certain information technology development activities including the implementation and incremental amortization of the cost of a new enterprise resource planning system additionally higher legal fees were incurred due to strategic initiatives including the acquisition of cfl and the sale of the phosphate business

in the nitrogen segment net sales increased by 845 million or 2 due primarily to higher nitrogen fertilizer average selling prices which were partially offset by lower sales volume average selling prices for nitrogen fertilizer increased due primarily to positive market conditions as favorable weather created a longer application window tight world market conditions existed for ammonia and urea due to lower international ammonia production and tight domestic supply conditions existed due to increased demand caused by the high level of planted acres and low downstream inventories nitrogen segment net sales was impacted by the cfl selling price modifications on an as adjusted basis net sales in the nitrogen segment increased 5 

in the phosphate segment net sales declined 784 million or 7 due to a 12 decline in average phosphate fertilizer selling prices partially offset by a 6 increase in phosphate sales volume 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales in our nitrogen segment averaged approximately 168 per ton in 2012 compared to 188 per ton in 2011 this 11 decrease was due primarily to lower realized natural gas cost and a 665 million unrealized net marktomarket gain on natural gas derivatives in the current year compared to a 773 million unrealized net loss in the prior year phosphate segment cost of sales averaged 397 per ton in 2012 compared to 392 per ton in the prior year 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 218 million to 1518 million in 2012 from 1300 million in 2011 due primarily to higher corporate office expenses including higher professional service fees associated with the design and implementation of a new enterprise resource planning erp system and higher outside legal fees and employee incentive compensation costs the higher legal costs were primarily associated with environmental regulatory costs and corporate activities including our planned acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in cfl and capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa 

restructuring and integration costs 

no restructuring and integration costs were incurred in 2012 compared to 44 million in 2011 as integration activities associated with the acquisition of terra were completed in 2011 

other operating—net 

other operating—net was 491 million in 2012 compared to 209 million in 2011 the expense recorded in 2012 consisted primarily of 219 million of costs associated with engineering studies for capacity expansion projects at various nitrogen complexes 133 million of environmental and other costs associated with our closed facilities and 55 million of losses on the disposal of fixed assets the expense recorded in 2011 included a 348 million impairment charge related to our woodward oklahoma methanol plant 81 million of costs associated with our closed facilities and losses of 

cf industries holdings inc 

72 million on the disposal of fixed assets partially offset by a 325 million gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses and a 20 million gain on the sale of a noncore transportation business 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates consists of our 50 share of the operating results of plnl and our 50 interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in houston texas equity in earnings of operating affiliates decreased 32 million to 470 million in 2012 as compared to 502 million in 2011 due primarily to reduced sales and earnings at plnl due to a planned turnaround which was partially offset by improved sales and earnings for the ammonia storage joint venture 

interest—net 

net interest expense was 1310 million in 2012 compared to 1455 million in 2011 the decrease in expense was due primarily to a decrease in amortized loan fees including a 47 million decrease in accelerated loan fee amortization in 2012 we terminated the 2010 credit agreement and recognized 152 million accelerated amortization of deferred loan fees in 2011 we repaid the remaining balance of our senior secured term loan and recognized 199 million accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs 

income taxes 

our income tax provision for 2012 was 9642 million on pretax income of 28 billion or an effective tax rate of 341 compared to an income tax provision of 9265 million on a pretax income of 26 billion and an effective tax rate of 350 in 2011 the decline in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by lower us taxes on foreign earnings as well as lower state taxes in 2012 than in the prior year the effective tax rate does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests in tnclp a partnership which does not record an income tax provision on august 2 2012 we entered into a definitive agreement with glencore international plc glencore to acquire the interest in cfl currently owned by viterra as a result cfl recorded an income tax provision in 2012 in 2011 cfl did not record an income tax provision see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information on income taxes 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes consists of our share of the operating results of unconsolidated joint venture interests in growhow and keytrade the 162 million increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to higher net earnings at growhow due to improved operating results declines in uk corporate tax rates and an 111 million insurance settlement related to a fire that occurred in 2011 

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest 

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest include the interest of the 34 holder of cfls common and preferred shares and the net earnings attributable to the 247 interest of the publicly held common units of tnclp the 1471 million decrease was mainly due to the impact of the cfl selling price modification that was made in 2012 during each quarter of 2012 and 2011 the tnclp minimum quarterly distribution was exceeded which entitled us to receive increased distributions on our general partner interests as provided for in the tnclp agreement of limited

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders increased to 2859 in 2012 from 2198 in 2011 due to an increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders and a decrease in the weighted average number of shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program under which we repurchased 65 million shares of our common stock in 2011 and an additional 31 million shares in 2012 

operating results by business segment 

our business is organized and managed internally based on two segments the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment which are differentiated primarily by their products the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate

impact of cfl selling price modifications 

as discussed in the items affecting comparability of results section of this discussion and analysis in the fourth quarter of 2012 the cfl selling prices to viterra were modified to cost plus an agreedupon margin from marketbased pricing retroactive to january 1 2012 this change had no impact on our net earnings attributable to common stockholders as cfl was a consolidated variable interest entity prior to april 30 2013 however these changes impact the comparability of certain amounts between 2013 and prior years on april 30 2013 cf industries acquired the noncontrolling interests in cfl and cfl became a wholly owned subsidiary of cf industries 

the financial results for 2013 include four months of cfl selling prices based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin and eight months of market based selling prices the following table adjusts the nitrogen segment results for 2012 and 2011 to a similar selling price pattern of 4 months based on production costs and 8 months based on market prices to be comparable to the 2013 results

net sales net sales in the nitrogen segment decreased 4188 million or 8 in 2013 from 2012 due primarily to an 8 decrease in average selling prices the nitrogen segment net sales were 

cf industries holdings inc 

impacted by the cfl selling price modifications on an as adjusted basis net sales in the nitrogen segment decreased by 11 average selling prices decreased to 361 per ton in 2013 from 393 per ton in 2012 including declines of 16 for urea 6 for an and 2 for both ammonia and uan as compared to the prior year the decline in urea prices versus the prior year was primarily due to increased supply as a result of higher urea exports from chinese producers during the low tariff export season the decline in ammonia prices versus the prior year was due to the combination of a weaker nitrogen pricing environment higher domestic production rates and inventory levels and reduced demand associated with unfavorable weather conditions during 2013 the cold and wet spring and the shortened fall application season reduced ammonia demand compared to the favorable application environment during 2012 the decline in uan prices versus the prior year was due primarily to higher global supply of nitrogen products 

cost of sales cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged 172 per ton in 2013 compared to 168 per ton in 2012 this 2 increase was due primarily to an 8 increase in the realized cost of natural gas and a 136 million reduction in net unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in the current year compared to 2012 the current year includes a marktomarket gain on natural gas derivatives of 529 million while 2012 includes a marktomarket gain of 665 million

net sales net sales in the nitrogen segment increased 845 million or 2 to 51 billion in 2012 from 50 billion in 2011 due primarily to a 2 increase in average selling prices the nitrogen segment net sales were impacted by the cfl selling price modifications on an as adjusted basis net sales in the nitrogen segment increased 5 average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices increased to 393 per ton in 2012 from 385 per ton in 2011 with increases in ammonia and urea higher ammonia and urea average selling prices resulted from tight industrywide supply conditions due to increased us demand caused by the higher level of planted acres in 2012 and expected in 2013 and lower downstream inventories sales volume in 2012 approximated the level in 2011 as higher sales of ammonia and other nitrogen products were offset by lower sales volumes of uan and ammonium nitrate a favorable application environment for ammonia during 2012 supported the higher sales volume for this product the lower sales volumes of uan and ammonia nitrate were due to scheduled plant turnarounds and maintenance activities during 2012 that resulted in lower production of these products lower uan sales volume was also due to a shift in product mix favoring higher margin nitrogen products during the year 

cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged approximately 168 per ton in 2012 compared to 188 per ton in 2011 the 11 decrease was due primarily to lower realized natural gas costs and 665 million in unrealized net marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in 2012 compared to net losses of 773 million in 2011 the average cost of natural gas declined by 21 from 428 per mmbtu in 2011 to 339 per mmbtu in 2012

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary uses of cash are for operating costs working capital capital expenditures debt service investments taxes share repurchases and dividends our working capital requirements are affected by several factors including demand for our products selling prices raw material costs freight and storage costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business generally our primary source of cash is cash from operations which includes cash generated by customer advances we may also from time to time access the capital markets or engage in borrowings under our credit agreement 

during 2013 the following significant events have had or will have an impact on our cash and liquidity position 

• under our current boardauthorized 30 billion share purchase program we repurchased 73 million common shares in 2013 for a total cost of 14 billion • through the end of 2013 we made 07 billion of capital expenditures related to our 38 billion capacity expansion projects these projects are expected to be onstream by 2016 during 2014 we expect to spend approximately 20 billion on these projects • in april 2013 we completed the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in cfl for 09 billion • in october 2013 we entered into a set of strategic agreements with mosaic including a definitive agreement to sell the entirety of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida for a purchase price of approximately 14 billion in cash subject to adjustment as provided in the agreement plus two agreements to supply ammonia to mosaic we expect the phosphate business sale transaction will close in the first half of 2014 • in april 2013 we amended and restated our credit agreement increasing the revolving credit facility by 05 billion to 10 billion and extending the maturity date to may 2018 • in may 2013 we issued 15 billion in senior notes with 750 million due in 2023 and 750 million due in 2043 • in december 2013 we announced our intent to raise up to 15 billion in longterm debt in 2014 further details regarding these events are provided below

capacity expansion projects and restricted cash 

in november 2012 we announced that our board of directors had authorized expenditures of 38 billion to construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex in combination these two new facilities will be able to produce 21 million tons of gross ammonia per year and upgraded products ranging from 20 to 27 million tons of granular urea per year and up to 18 million tons of uan 32 solution per year depending on our choice of product mix the 38 billion cost estimate includes engineering and design equipment procurement construction associated infrastructure including natural gas connections and power supply and product storage and handling systems these plants will increase our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville improve our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location and allow us to benefit from the favorable cost advantage of north american natural gas all of these new facilities are scheduled to be onstream by 2016 we expect to finance the capital expenditures through available cash and securities cash generated from operations and borrowings total cash spent to date on capital expenditures for the expansion projects was 4769 million including 3561 million spent during 2013 in addition 2036 million was invested in the expansion project and not paid at december 31 2013 and recognized in the consolidated balance sheet in the lines labeled accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities 

cf industries holdings inc 

we have retained engineering and procurement services from an affiliate of thyssenkrupp uhde uhde for both the donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa expansion projects under the terms of the engineering and procurement services contract we have granted uhde a security interest in a restricted cash account and maintain a cash balance in that account equal to the cancellation fees for procurement services and equipment that would arise if we were to cancel the projects the amount in the account will change over time based on procurement costs the amount is projected to reach approximately 375 million at certain points in time during construction and will be zero by the end of the project at december 31 2013 there was 1540 million held in this account this restricted cash is not included in our cash and cash equivalents and is reported separately on our consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows 

capital spending 

we make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements capital expenditures totaled 8238 million in 2013 as compared to 5235 million in 2012 the increase in capital expenditures is primarily the result of the 3561 million spent on the two capacity expansion projects discussed above 

projected capital spending 

we expect capital expenditures in 2014 to be approximately 25 billion including 20 billion for the capacity expansion projects and 05 billion of sustaining and other capital expenditures planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting unanticipated increases in cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints and other unforeseen difficulties 

acquisitions of the noncontrolling interests in canadian fertilizers limited 

in 2012 we entered into agreements to acquire the 34 of cfls common and preferred shares owned by viterra the product purchase agreement between cfl and viterra and the cfl common shares held by growmark and la coop fédérée for a total purchase price of approximately c09 billion in april 2013 we completed the acquisitions since cfl was previously a consolidated variable interest entity the purchase price was recognized as follows a 08 billion reduction in paid in capital a 01 billion deferred tax asset and the removal of the cfl noncontrolling interest cfl is now a wholly owned subsidiary and we are entitled to purchase 100 of cfls ammonia and granular urea production for additional information see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

planned disposition of phosphate business and ammonia supply agreements 

in october 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with mosaic to sell our entire phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida for a purchase price of approximately 14 billion in cash subject to adjustment as provided in the agreement and entered into two agreements to supply ammonia to mosaic the first agreement which is not conditioned upon completion of the phosphate business sale transaction provides for us to supply between 600000 and 800000 tons of ammonia per year from our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex beginning no later than 2017 the second agreement provides for us to supply approximately 300000 tons of ammonia per year sourced from our point lisas nitrogen limited plnl joint venture beginning at the closing of the phosphate business sale transaction see further discussion of this transaction in the section titled items affecting comparability of results and in note 12—assets and liabilities held for sale to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

we have operations in canada and interests in corporate joint ventures in the united kingdom the republic of trinidad and tobago and switzerland the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us are recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings are recognized unless the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested based upon our current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurs at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings can occur in different periods cash balances held by corporate joint ventures are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint ventures on a periodic basis 

at december 31 2013 approximately 2823 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 17 billion was held by our canadian subsidiaries the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represents accumulated earnings of our foreign operations which is not considered to be permanently reinvested we have recognized deferred income taxes on these earnings for the foreign and domestic taxes that would be due upon their repatriation to the united states at december 31 2013 the cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian cash balances would be approximately 141 million 

debt 

we intend to raise up to 15 billion in longterm debt in 2014 this new debt in addition to cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of the phosphate mining and manufacturing business will fund our capital expenditure programs dividends to shareholders working capital and additional share repurchases 

credit agreement 

on april 22 2013 we amended and restated the cf holdings credit agreement credit agreement increasing the revolving credit facility from 500 million to 10 billion and extending the maturity from may 1 2017 to may 1 2018 all obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured currently cf holdings is the only guarantor of cf industries obligations under the credit agreement certain of cf industries material domestic subsidiaries would be required to become guarantors under the credit agreement if such subsidiary were to guarantee our other debt or cf industries debt in excess of 350 million as of december 31 2013 9951 million was available for borrowing under our credit agreement net of 49 million of outstanding letters of credit and there were no outstanding borrowings 

our credit agreement includes representations warranties covenants and events of default including requirements that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio as well as other customary covenants and events of default our senior notes indentures also include certain covenants and events of default as of december 31 2013 we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement and the senior notes indentures

senior notes 

at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we had 31 billion and 16 billion of senior notes outstanding respectively with maturities ranging from 2018 through 2043 as follows 

senior notes due 2018 and 2020 

on april 23 2010 cf industries issued 800 million aggregate principal amount of 6875 senior notes due may 1 2018 and 800 million aggregate principal amount of 7125 senior notes due may 1 2020 the 20182020 notes interest is paid semiannually on may 1 and november 1 and the 20182020 notes are redeemable at our option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at specified makewhole redemption prices 

under the supplemental indentures governing the 20182020 notes the 20182020 notes are guaranteed by cf holdings in addition in the event that a subsidiary of ours other than cf industries becomes a borrower or a guarantor under the credit agreement or any renewal replacement or refinancing thereof such subsidiary would be required to become a guarantor of the 20182020 notes 

senior notes due 2023 and 2043 

on may 23 2013 cf industries issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 3450 senior notes due june 1 2023 and 750 million aggregate principal amount of 4950 senior notes due june 1 2043 the 20232043 notes interest is paid semiannually on june 1 and december 1 and the 20232043 notes are redeemable at our option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at specified makewhole redemption prices we received net proceeds of approximately 148 billion from the issuance and sale of the 20232043 notes after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 

under the supplemental indentures governing the 20232043 notes the 20232043 notes are guaranteed by cf holdings in addition in the event that a subsidiary of ours other than cf industries becomes a borrower or a guarantor under the credit agreement or any renewal replacement or refinancing thereof such subsidiary would be required to become a guarantor of the 20232043 notes provided that such requirement will no longer apply following the repayment of both issues of the 20182020 notes or the subsidiaries of ours other than cf industries otherwise become no longer subject to such a requirement to guarantee the 20182020 notes 

forward sales and customer advances 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers as a result of using derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives additionally our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment unlike nitrogen fertilizer products sold under forward sales contracts we typically are unable to use hedges to reduce our exposure to raw material price changes for components of our phosphate manufacturing cost the largest of which are sulfur and ammonia as a result we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis 

cf industries holdings inc 

customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had 1206 million and 3807 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets 

while customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances could likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances could likely increase also borrowing under our credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity 

under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales 

derivative financial instruments 

we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions and in most cases the use of master netting arrangements 

the master netting arrangements to most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features with slidingscale credit support thresholds that are dependent upon the ratings assigned to our longterm unsecured debt by certain credit rating agencies downgrades in our credit ratings could cause the applicable threshold levels to increase if our net liability positions with the counterparties exceed the threshold amounts those counterparties could require cash collateral some other form of credit support or daily cash settlement of unrealized losses 

as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 02 million and 09 million respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates as of december 31 2013 we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 763 million mmbtus and the notional amount of our open foreign currency derivatives was 6363 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts 

financial assurance requirements 

in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment we are also subject to financial assurance obligations related to the closure and maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at both our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex and 

cf industries holdings inc 

our closed bartow florida phosphate fertilizer complex these financial assurance obligations result from two requirements the first is a 2010 consent decree with the epa and the fdep with respect to our compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra at our plant city complex the plant city consent decree the second is state of florida financial assurance regulations florida financial assurance that apply to both our plant city and bartow complexes both of these regulations allow the use of a funding mechanism as a means of complying with the financial assurance requirements associated with the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stacks as well as costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure we maintain a trust account for the benefit of the epa and the fdep and an escrow account for the benefit of the fdep to meet these financial assurance requirements on our consolidated balance sheets these are collectively referred to as asset retirement obligation funds aro funds and at december 31 2013 these assets were recorded as assets held for sale the trust for the plant city consent decree is fully funded and we expect the remaining 10 million will be funded in the state of florida financial assurance escrow account near the end of 2015 both financial assurance funding obligations require estimates of future expenditures that could be impacted by refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation changes in regulations discount rates and the timing of activities additional funding would be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed investment earnings in the trust or escrow accounts in the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with mosaic to sell our entire phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida as a result the asset retirement obligation funds are included in noncurrent assets held for sale at december 31 2013 at december 31 2013 and 2012 the balance in the aro funds was 2037 million and 2008 million respectively 

the amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack systems closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report these expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the trust and escrow accounts which are based on the guidelines set forth in the plant city consent decree and florida financial assurance regulations ultimately the funds in these accounts will be used to fund the closure and maintenance of the phosphogypsum stack systems 

florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities we will also be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted the demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a trust fund agreement or escrow account based on these current regulations we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in florida utilizing any of these methods

cash flows 

operating activities 

year ended december 31 2013 compared to year ended december 31 2012 

net cash generated from operating activities in 2013 was 15 billion as compared to 24 billion in 2012 the 09 billion decline was due to the combination of a 3906 million decline in net earnings and a higher level of net working capital invested in the business in 2013 versus 2012 during 2013 7402 million more was invested in net working capital than in 2012 due primarily to higher income tax payments and lower customer advances as customers delayed purchasing decisions in 2013 as compared to 2012 

year ended december 31 2012 compared to year ended december 31 2011 

net cash generated from operating activities in 2012 was 24 billion as compared to 21 billion in 2011 the 2967 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to an increase in net earnings and a lower level of working capital invested in the business at the end of 2012 as compared to the end of 2011 as lower inventory lower receivables and higher customer advances and accounts payable and accrued expenses contributed to the lower levels of working capital 

investing activities 

years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

net cash used in investing activities was 10193 million in 2013 compared to 5135 million in 2012 cash used in investing activities in 2013 included 8238 million in capital expenditures and 1540 million transferred to a restricted cash account in support of the capacity expansion projects discussed previously the cash used in investing activities in 2012 was primarily for capital expenditures partially offset by 654 million from the sale of short term securities and property plant and equipment the cash used in investing activities in 2011 was primarily for capital expenditures partially offset by 547 million in proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment and 379 million in sales and maturities of short term securities additions to property plant and equipment accounted for 8238 million 5235 million and 2472 million of cash used in investing activities in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the increases in capital expenditures in 2013 and 2012 related primarily to cash spending for the major capacity expansion projects at our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa facilities 

we made contributions of 29 million 554 million and 504 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively to our asset retirement obligation trust and escrow accounts the balance in these accounts is reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 

financing activities 

years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

net cash used in financing activities was 9803 million in 2013 compared to 7968 million in 2012 and 15 billion in 2011 in may 2013 we issued senior notes and received proceeds of approximately 15 billion cash used in financing activities in 2013 included 9187 million to acquire the noncontrolling interests in cfl cash used for stock repurchases in 2013 2012 and 2011 was 14 billion 5000 million and 10 billion respectively we distributed 737 million to the noncontrolling interests in 2013 compared to 2318 million in 2012 and 1457 million in 2011 the decrease in distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2013 was due to the acquisition of the 

cf industries holdings inc 

noncontrolling interests in cfl in april and the modifications to cfl selling prices in the fourth quarter of 2012 which impacted the payments made the first four months of 2013 in 2012 130 million was used for the repayment of long term debt compared to 3460 million in 2011

other longterm obligations 

as of december 31 2013 our liabilities held for sale included balances related to asset retirement obligations aros and our other liabilities included environmental remediation liabilities the estimated timing and amount of cash outflows associated with these liabilities are as follows 



1 represents the undiscounted inflationadjusted estimated cash outflows required to settle the recorded aros the corresponding present value of these future expenditures is 1666 million as of december 31 2013 excludes any amounts we may be required to deposit into our escrow or trust accounts to meet our financial assurance funding requirements see the discussion of our financial assurance requirements earlier in this section we also have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included is reclamation of land and closure of effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2013 dollars is approximately 530 million we do not believe that there is a reasonable basis for currently estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities therefore the table above does not contain any payments for these aros see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further discussion of our aros as described in financial assurance requirements we are required to set aside cash on an annual basis in escrow and trust accounts established to cover costs associated with closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems if necessary these accounts will be the source of a significant portion of the cash required to settle the aros pertaining to the phosphogypsum stack systems 2 cash flows occurring after 2018 are detailed in the following table

subsequent event 

in 2014 we repurchased 12 million of the companys common shares for 2949 million as part of the 30 billion share repurchase program announced in the third quarter of 2012 together with the 73 million shares repurchased during 2013 these repurchases bring the total repurchased shares to date under this program to 85 million for an aggregate expenditure of 17 billion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer the rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to ten years and the barge charter commitments currently have terms ranging from two to seven years we also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system some of which contain minimum throughput requirements the storage agreements contain minimum terms ranging from one to three years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information concerning leases 

we do not have any other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

cf industries holdings inc 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation depletion and amortization is computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews 

scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher production costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line entitled additions to property plant and equipment 

inventory valuation 

we review our inventory balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our most recent estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales 

asset retirement obligations aros 

asset retirement obligations aros are legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value when initially recognized the fair value based on discounted future cash flows is recorded both as a liability and an increase in the carrying amount of the related longlived asset in subsequent periods depreciation of the asset and accretion of the liability are recorded for additional information see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

cf industries holdings inc 

our most significant aros are driven by regulations in florida governing the construction operation closure and longterm maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems and site reclamation for the phosphate rock mine in hardee county florida other aros consist of conditional aros for the plant city bartow and hardee facilities for which a reasonable basis exists for estimating a settlement date these aros relate to cessation of operations and generally include the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials asbestos equipment vessels piping and storage tanks 

we have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2013 dollars is 530 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros at december 31 2013 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion 

recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review 

the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired we review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries annually to determine if there is a loss in value of the investment we determine the fair value of the investment using an income approach valuation method if the sum of the expected future discounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized immediately 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the nitrogen and phosphate segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test 

cf industries holdings inc 

involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an income based valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2013 or 2012 reviews as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the carrying value of our goodwill was 21 billion 

derivative financial instruments 

the accounting for the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and whether the instrument is effective as part of a hedging relationship changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments considered effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as the changes occur and are reclassified into income or expense as the hedge item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as the changes occur 

certain of our foreign currency derivatives that we use to manage our exposure to changes in exchange rates on eurodenominated expenditures associated with our major capacity expansion projects have been designated as cash flow hedges the expected cash flows for the capital projects involve the use of judgments and estimates which are subject to change we assess both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the designated cash flow hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable hedge accounting is discontinued in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting 

income taxes 

we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period when these changes occur 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

cf industries holdings inc 

a deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that are considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income tax liability is recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested 

as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 7686 million at december 31 2013 which was 679 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2013 pbo was computed based on a weighted average discount rate of 48 which was based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 490 million higher or 445 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussed 

the weighted average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2013 was 40 if the discount rate used to compute 2013 pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 49 million higher or 38 million lower respectively than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 51 weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets used to calculate pension expense in 2013 is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2013 would have been 32 million lower or higher respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further discussion of our pension plans 

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest and use the equity method to account for investments in affiliates that we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies plus the amortization expense of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of purchase accounting our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policy decisions and 

cf industries holdings inc 

material intercompany transactions we regularly review our variable interest entities for potential changes in consolidation status 

we eliminate from our consolidated financial results all significant intercompany transactions 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

discussion of seasonality impacts on operations 

our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices the valuation of our investments interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to fertilizer sales are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea and uan 32 by approximately 32 22 and 14 respectively 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments covering periods of generally less than 18 months the derivative instruments that we use currently are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and call options these derivatives settle using nymex futures price indexes which represent the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 we had open derivative contracts for 763 million mmbtus and 589 million mmbtus respectively a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas at december 31 2013 would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of 603 million and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by 603 million 

we purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of dap and map there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered through increases in selling prices we enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and 

cf industries holdings inc 

sulfur at market prices a 10 per ton change in the related cost of a short ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change dap production cost by 218 per ton and 382 per ton respectively we also may from time to time purchase ammonia granular urea uan dap and map to augment or replace production at our facilities 

interest rate fluctuations 

at december 31 2013 we had four series of senior notes totaling 31 billion outstanding with maturity dates of may 1 2018 may 1 2020 june 1 2023 and june 1 2043 the senior notes have fixed interest rates the fair value of our senior notes outstanding at december 31 2013 was approximately 33 billion borrowings under our credit agreement bear a current market rate of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings however in 2013 there were no borrowings under that agreement 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we have entered into eurous dollar derivative hedging transactions related to the euro denominated construction costs associated with our capacity expansion projects at our donaldsonville and port neal facilities at december 31 2013 the notional amount of our open foreign currency forward contracts was approximately 6363 million and the fair value was a net unrealized gain of 289 million a 10 change in usdeuro forward exchange rates would change the fair value of these positions by 636 million 

we are also directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the swiss franc we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

we operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries inc now our whollyowned subsidiary were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock 

in april 2010 we acquired terra industries inc terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock terras financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results and in the nitrogen segment results since the acquisition date of april 5 2010 as a result of the 

cf industries holdings inc 

terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities our 753 interest in tnclp and certain joint venture interests 

operating segments 

our business is divided into two operating segments the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment the nitrogen segment includes the manufacture and sale of ammonia granular urea uan and an the phosphate segment includes the manufacture and sale of dap and map 

nitrogen segment 

we are the largest nitrogen fertilizer producer in north america our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia granular urea uan and an our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the following table the sales shown do not reflect amounts used internally such as ammonia in the manufacture of other products 



1 other nitrogen segment products include aqua ammonia nitric acid urea liquor and def 

gross margin for the nitrogen segment was 29136 million 25632 million and 10267 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively total assets for the nitrogen segment were 60 billion as of both december 31 2012 and 2011 and 61 billion as of december 31 2010 

we operate seven nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in north america we own 100 of four production facilities in the central united states and one in ontario canada we also have a 753 interest in tnclp and its subsidiary tnlp which owns a nitrogen fertilizer facility in verdigris oklahoma and a 66 economic interest in cfl a variable interest entity that owns the nitrogen fertilizer complex in medicine hat alberta canada in 2012 the combined production capacity of these seven facilities represented approximately 39 34 47 and 22 of north american ammonia granular urea uan and ammonium nitrate production capacity respectively each of our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in north america has onsite storage to provide flexibility to manage the flow of outbound shipments without impacting production 

our joint venture interests in plnl and growhow provide additional production capacity in three additional nitrogen fertilizer production facilities one located in the republic of trinidad and tobago and two located in the united kingdom 

cf industries holdings inc 

the following table shows the production capacities at each of our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in 2012 natural gas accounted for approximately 39 of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities have access to abundant competitivelypriced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities we have facilities located at or near henry hub in louisiana oneok in oklahoma aeco in alberta ventura in iowa and dawn in ontario 

our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consume in the aggregate in excess of 250 million mmbtus of natural gas annually we employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced supply of natural gas we also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices for further information about our natural gas hedging activities see note 25—derivative financial instruments 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the safe efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer to terminals warehouses and customers each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capability and location 

our north american production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the us and canada with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5200 tank and hopper cars as well as railcars provided by rail carriers 

the north american waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our donaldsonville verdigris and yazoo city facilities we employ a fleet of ten leased tow boats and 32 river barges to ship ammonia and uan we also utilize contract marine services to move urea and phosphate fertilizers 

three of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia the donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2000mile long nustar pipeline through which we transport ammonia to more than 20 terminals and shipping points in the midwestern us corn belt our verdigris and port neal facilities are connected to the 1100mile long magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the us midwest

phosphate segment 

we are a major manufacturer of phosphate fertilizer products our phosphate fertilizer products are dap and map 

our historical sales of phosphate fertilizer products are shown in the table below 



gross margin for the phosphate segment was 1997 million 3324 million and 1528 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively total assets for the phosphate segment were 7952 million 6964 million and 6183 million as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

our phosphate fertilizer manufacturing operations are located in central florida and consist of a phosphate fertilizer chemical complex in plant city a phosphate rock mine a beneficiation plant and phosphate rock reserves in hardee county and a deepwater terminal facility in the port of tampa we own each of these facilities and properties 

the following table summarizes our phosphate fertilizer production volumes for the last three years and current production capacities for phosphaterelated products 



1 p 2 o 5 is the basic measure of the nutrient content in phosphate fertilizer products 2 capacities shown for phosphate rock at the hardee county phosphate rock mine and dapmap granulation at the plant city facility are constrained by plant citys capacity to produce phosphoric acid 

hardee county phosphate rock mine 

in 1975 we purchased 20000 acres of land in hardee county florida that was originally estimated to contain in excess of 100 million tons of recoverable rock reserves between 1978 and 1993 we operated a one million ton per year phosphate rock mine on a 5000acre portion of these reserves in 1995 we began operations at an expanded mine on the remaining 15000acre area of the reserve property since that time we have acquired additional rock reserves through acquisitions or exchanges of several smaller parcels of land 

cf industries holdings inc 

the table below shows the estimated reserves at the hardee phosphate complex as of december 31 2012 also reflected in the table is the grade of the reserves expressed as a percentage of bone phosphate of lime bpl and p 2 o 5  the table also reflects the average values of the following material contaminants contained in the reserves ferrous oxide fe 2 o 3  plus aluminum oxide al 2 o 3  and magnesium oxide mgo 

proven and probable reserves 1 as of december 31 2012 



1 the minimum drill hole density for the proven reserves classification is 1 hole per 20 acres 2 the reserve estimates provided have been developed by the company in accordance with industry guide 7 promulgated by the sec we estimate that 99 of the reserves are proven 

our phosphate reserve estimates are based on geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff geologist as of december 31 2012 reserve estimates are updated periodically to reflect actual phosphate rock recovered new drilling information and other geological or mining data estimates for 99 of the reserves are based on 20acre density drilling 

plant city phosphate complex 

our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in north america at one million tons per year its phosphoric acid capacity represents approximately 10 of the total us capacity all of plant citys phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates dap and map representing approximately 13 of us capacity for ammonium phosphate fertilizer products in 2012 the combination of the plant city phosphate fertilizer complex and the hardee mine gives us one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in north america 

bartow phosphate complex 

we own a site in bartow florida on which we operated a phosphate manufacturing complex this complex ceased production in 1999 and the former manufacturing facilities have been dismantled and disposed of in accordance with local laws and regulations the related phosphogypsum stack has been closed and the former storage and distribution facilities were sold along with excess land we continue to be obligated for the closure of the cooling pond management of water treatment on the site and providing longterm care for the site in accordance with regulatory requirements 

phosphate raw materials 

phosphate rock supply phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers approximately 35 tons of phosphate rock are needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5 the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex typically consumes in excess of three million tons of rock annually as of december 31 2012 our hardee rock mine had approximately 12 years of fully permitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to 

cf industries holdings inc 

expand the geographical area at our hardee property where we can mine the expanded area has an estimated 347 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves we estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area 

sulfur supply sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid approximately three quarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5  our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 800000 long tons of sulfur annually when operating at capacity we obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration in 2012 martin sulphur our largest molten sulfur supplier supplied approximately 61 of the molten sulfur used at plant city 

ammonia supply dap and map have a nitrogen content of 18 and 11 respectively and a phosphate nutrient content of 46 and 52 respectively ammonia is the primary source of nitrogen in dap and map operating at capacity our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex consumes approximately 400000 tons of ammonia annually 

the ammonia used at our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia storage facility located in tampa florida this facility consists of a 38000ton ammonia storage tank access to a deepwater dock that is capable of discharging oceangoing vessels and rail and truck loading facilities in addition to supplying our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex our tampa ammonia distribution system has the capacity to support ammonia sales to and distribution services for other customers sales of ammonia from our tampa terminal are reported in our nitrogen business segment the ammonia supply for tampa is purchased from offshore sources providing us with access to the broad international ammonia market 

phosphate distribution 

we operate a phosphate fertilizer warehouse located at a deepwater port facility in tampa florida most of the phosphate fertilizer produced at plant city is shipped by truck or rail to our tampa warehouse where it is loaded onto vessels for shipment to export customers or for transport across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river in 2012 our tampa warehouse handled approximately 13 million tons of phosphate fertilizers or about 67 of our production the remainder of our phosphate fertilizer production is transported by truck or rail directly to customers or to inmarket storage facilities 

phosphate fertilizer shipped across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river is transferred into river barges near new orleans phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is transported to our storage facilities or delivered directly to customers river transportation is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators 

storage facilities and other properties 

at december 31 2012 we owned or leased space at 76 inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 20state region including storage at our production facilities and at the tampa 

cf industries holdings inc 

warehouse and ammonia terminal we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately three million tons of fertilizer our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table 



1 capacity is expressed as the equivalent volume of uan measured on a 32 nitrogen content basis 2 our dry products include urea dap and map 3 our lease agreements are typically for periods of one to three years 

customers 

the principal customers for our nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors chs inc was our largest customer in 2012 and accounted for ten percent of our consolidated net sales sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force 

competition 

our markets are intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

in our nitrogen segment our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium and koch nitrogen there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition from foreignsourced products continuously 

in our phosphate segment our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium mosaic potash corp and simplot the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer andor trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations 

seasonality 

the sales patterns of our six major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant 

cf industries holdings inc 

quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

financial information about foreign and domestic sales and operations 

the amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying value of our foreign and domestic assets are set forth in note 30—segment disclosures 

environment health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes violations can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment 

environmental health and safety expenditures 

our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2012 totaled approximately 452 million in 2013 we estimate that we will spend approximately 613 million for environmental health and safety capital expenditures the increase in expenditures in 2013 is primarily related to certain projects to reduce emissions from our facilities including projects to improve the integrity and capacity of storage tanks at certain plant locations environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

federal and state numeric nutrient criteria regulation 

on august 18 2009 the epa entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court the court on november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious the court ordered the epa to issue proposed or final numeric nutrient criteria for streams by may 21 2012 subject to the epa seeking an extension of such time period pursuant to the terms of the 2009 consent decree subsequently the court granted the epas motion to allow the epa to propose numeric nutrient criteria for streams by november 30 2012 and to finalize such criteria by august 31 2013 

in december 2011 the state of florida proposed its own numeric nutrient criteria for surface waters the nitrogen and phosphorous criteria in the proposed rule are substantially identical to the federal rule but the state proposal includes biological verification as a component of the criteria and adopts existing nutrient total maximum daily loads tmdl as applicable numeric criteria the impact of these modifications could be to provide more flexibility with respect to nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits so long as such discharges do not impair the biological health of receiving water bodies environmental groups filed a challenge to the proposed 

cf industries holdings inc 

state rule but the rule was upheld by an administrative law judge on june 8 2012 and became final an appeal of the administrative decision upholding the rule is now pending before a florida appellate court 

on november 30 2012 the epa approved floridas rule however because the epa identified what it considered to be gaps in the scope of the waters covered by floridas rule and potential legal issues that might bar the florida rule from going into effect the epa pursuant to the court order described above has again proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida streams there is substantial uncertainty as to whether this rule will be withdrawn before it is finalized or if a rule is finalized as to the scope of florida inland flowing waters that will be covered by the epa regulation 

moreover notwithstanding the epas approval of the florida rule the federal criteria for lakes and inland waters previously upheld by the court excluding the criteria found to be arbitrary and capricious became effective on january 6 2013 the epa has proposed to stay the effective date of these criteria in light of the ongoing developments with the florida regulation 

the 2009 consent decree also requires the epa to develop numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the numeric criteria adopted by the state of florida and approved by the epa includes numeric criteria for some coastal and estuarine waters but as with streams epa has raised issues regarding the scope of coverage of floridas regulation accordingly on november 30 2012 the epa proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the epa must finalize these criteria by september 30 2013 unless future developments allow the epa to withdraw the rule 

depending on the developments discussed herein federal or state numeric nutrient water quality criteria for florida waters could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining manufacturing and distribution operations in florida more stringent limits on wastewater discharge could increase our costs and limit our operations and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

regulation of greenhouse gases 

we are subject to regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states concerning climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions 

the united kingdom is a party to the kyoto protocol as a result of agreements reached during a conference in durban south africa in 2011 the kyoto protocol will continue in force for a second commitment period which will expire by 2020 to be replaced by another international agreement to be negotiated by 2015 which agreement is to go into effect in 2020 the united kingdom has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas trading system our joint venture uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require the joint venture to purchase co 2 emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our joint venture uk sites are also subject to the european union emissions trading scheme more stringent ghg emission limits in the uk and europe are expected to go into effect beginning in 2013 

in canada which in december 2011 withdrew from further participation in the kyoto protocol but signed the durban platform to negotiate a new international ghg agreement or protocol by 2015 we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canadas national pollutant release inventory and ontarios mandatory monitoring and 

cf industries holdings inc 

reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation ontario is also a party to the western climate initiative comprised of california the other states in the initiative having withdrawn and several canadian provinces which intends to establish a cap and trade regime for the trading of ghg credits within the regional area beginning in 2013 although ontario has not disavowed its participation in the initiative it has not developed regulations to establish a cap and trade program 

in the united states not a party to the kyoto protocol but a signatory to the durban platform with respect to the negotiation of a replacement for the kyoto protocol ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels the epa has issued federal ghg regulations that impact our facilities including a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in may 2010 the epa issued the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule this regulation establishes that the construction of new or modification of existing major sources of ghg emissions would become subject to the psd air permitting program and later the title v permitting program beginning in january 2011 and the regulation could significantly decrease the emissions thresholds that would subject facilities to these regulations in the future on december 20 2012 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit rejected a request to reconsider its decision to uphold the ghg regulations regulation of ghg emissions pursuant to the psd program could subject new capital projects to additional permitting requirements that may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects 

under the title v provisions of the tailoring rule all of our us manufacturing facilities will be required to include ghg emissions in future title v air permit applications other than the states implementation of the tailoring rule none of the states where our us production facilities are located—florida louisiana mississippi iowa and oklahoma—has proposed control regulations limiting ghg emissions iowa is a member of the midwest greenhouse gas reduction accord signed in 2007 but the member states appear to have discontinued any action to implement the accord 

revisions to new source performance standards for nitric acid plants 

we operate 13 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides no x  notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas 

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and mining permits authorizing operations at our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals 

as of december 31 2012 the area permitted for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 422 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which we expect to meet our 

cf industries holdings inc 

requirements at current production rates for approximately 12 years we have secured the necessary permits to mine these reserves from the fdep and the us army corps of engineers we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated additional 347 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which we expect will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area the estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective of the anticipated permittable mining areas based on recent similar permitting efforts in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have secured the state environmental authorization to increase the capacity of our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city with the completion of our current expansion project this stack has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits including additional expansion phases the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this date is approximately six years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in certain cases as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities we currently utilize a trust established for the benefit of the epa and the fdep and an escrow account established for the benefit of the fdep as a means of complying with financial assurance requirements for the closure and longterm care of our phosphogypsum stack systems for additional information on the cash deposit arrangements see note 10—asset retirement obligations 

several of our permits including our mining permit at the hardee phosphate complex require us to reclaim any property disturbed by our operations at our hardee property we currently mine approximately 300 to 500 acres of land each year all of which must be reclaimed the costs to reclaim this land vary based on the type of land involved and range from 3700 to 18200 an acre with an average of 11000 an acre for additional information on our hardee asset retirement obligations see note 10—asset retirement obligations 

our phosphate operations in florida are subject to regulations governing the closure and longterm maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the site of our former bartow phosphate complex we estimate that we will spend a total of approximately 2 million between 2013 and 2016 to complete closure of the cooling pond and channels water treating expenditures at bartow are estimated to require about 11 million over the next 44 years postclosure longterm care expenditures at bartow are estimated to total approximately 51 million for a 50 year period including 2013 to close the phosphogypsum stack at the plant city phosphate complex including the recently constructed expansion we estimate that we will spend approximately 96 million during the years 2033 through 2037 and another 45 million in 2087 to close the cooling pond water treating expenditures at plant city are estimated to approximate 6 million in 2018 63 million in 2033 through 2037 and 

cf industries holdings inc 

164 million thereafter through 2087 postclosure longterm care expenditures at plant city are estimated to total 105 million for a 50 year period commencing in 2038 these amounts are in nominal dollars using an assumed inflation rate of 3 

cost estimates for closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems are based on formal closure plans submitted to the state of florida which are subject to revision during negotiations over the next several years moreover the time frame involved in the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems extends as far as the year 2087 accordingly the actual amount to be spent also will depend upon factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation and changes in applicable laws and regulations these cost estimates may also increase if the plant city phosphogypsum stack is expanded further for additional information on asset retirement obligations related to our phosphogypsum systems see note 10—asset retirement obligations

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is dependent on north american natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our nitrogen fertilizers 

the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2012 the average daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america reached a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012 and a high of 377 per mmbtu on november 27 2012 during the three year period ended december 31 2012 the average daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 751 per mmbtu on january 8 2010 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012 

changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of high natural gas prices if this were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

over the last several years north american natural gas prices have declined in response to increased supply from the development of production from shale gas formations future production of natural gas from shale gas formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or increase its cost for other reasons if this were to occur natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our results of operations tend to be negatively impacted 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade 

periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacity 

during periods of industry oversupply our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production 

cf industries holdings inc 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities 

some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships 

china the worlds largest producer and consumer of fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability if chinese policy encourages exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may face increased competition from russian and ukrainian urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate almost all urea imports from russia and ukraine are currently subject to antidumping duty orders that impose duties of approximately 65 percent on urea imported into the united states from these two countries russia and ukraine currently have considerable capacity to produce urea and are among the worlds largest urea exporters in russia the price for natural gas used for industrial production continues to be set by the government on a nonmarket basis russian nitrogen fertilizer producers benefit from these governmentcontrolled natural gas prices encouraging inefficient urea production and high volumes of exports in ukraine we believe that the government intervenes with respect to natural gas prices available to fertilizer producers so as to permit continued exports the antidumping orders have been in place since 1987 and there has been very little urea imported into the united states from russia or ukraine since that time the us department of commerce regularly reviews the us sales of urea made by russian exporters in october 2011 the us department of commerce completed a review of us sales made by the russian exporter eurochem and concluded that duties of approximately one percent should be imposed this low rate of duty resulted in a marked increase in exports of russian urea to the united states in october 2012 the commerce department completed another review of eurochems sales and reduced to zero the duty applied to eurochems us urea imports this may result in more russian urea exports to the united states 

in 2011 the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission conducted the third sunset review of the urea antidumping orders and determined that they should remain in effect for another five years the next sunset review of those orders will not be initiated until late 2016 

russia is the worlds largest ammonium nitrate producer and exporter as in the case of urea russian ammonium nitrate producers benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia is subject to an antidumping duty order which currently imposes antidumping duties of almost 254 percent on russian ammonium nitrate imports into the united states in may 2011 this order replaced a longstanding suspension agreement which had imposed volume and pricing restrictions on russian ammonium nitrate imports in 2011 the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission completed the second sunset review of the 

cf industries holdings inc 

russian ammonium nitrate antidumping order and concluded that it will remain in effect for at least another five years russian producers of ammonium nitrate are likely to participate in legal processes through which they may reduce the applicable antidumping duty rate applicable to their us imports and if they are successful there may be an increase in us imports of unfairly priced russian ammonium nitrate further one russian producer is currently seeking permission to import an ammonium nitrate product outside the reach of the antidumping order if successful this effort would likely result in a significant increase in us imports of this russian ammonium nitrate product 

fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from ukraine is also subject to an antidumping duty order under which imports of this product are currently subject to a duty of over 156 percent that order is currently being reviewed and a decision as to whether the order will remain in place for an additional five years is expected to be issued by may 2013 if the order is revoked we are likely to experience a significant increase in us imports of unfairly priced ukrainian ammonium nitrate 

a decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products 

conditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control 

state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications in recent years for example ethanol production in the united states has increased significantly due in part to federal legislation mandating greater use of renewable fuels this increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuels standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to allow increased ethanol imports and eliminate the fuel mandate either of which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment 

our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations 

we rely on railroad trucking pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards 

cf industries holdings inc 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products 

if shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities these efforts by the railroads include i requesting that the surface transportation board or stb issue a policy statement finding that it is reasonable for a railroad to require a shipper to indemnify the railroads and carry insurance for all liability above a certain amount arising from the transportation of tih materials ii requesting that the stb approve an increase in the maximum reasonable rates that a railroad can charge for the transportation of tih materials including the recovery of the cost to implement the mandatory anticollision train control system referred to as positive train control iii lobbying for new legislation or regulations that would limit or eliminate the railroads common carrier obligation to transport tih materials and iv limit the liability or railroads in canada when transporting tih materials if the railroads were to succeed in one or more of these initiatives it could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads new regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products 

difficulties in the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system or cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results 

since the terra acquisition cf industries continued to utilize legacy terras separate information management systems to process transactions involving business operations of the legacy terra plants in the first quarter of 2013 we consolidated all business processes for the combined companies under a new single enterprise resource planning erp system utilizing software provided by sap this companywide system aligns business processes and procedures institutes more efficient transaction processing and improves access to and consistency of information to enable standardization of business activities the implementation of an erp system across the combined organization entails certain risks if we do not complete the implementation of the system successfully or if the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner it could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

as we continue to increase our dependence on information technologies to conduct our operations the risks associated with cyber security also increase we rely on management information systems among other things to manage our accounting manufacturing supply chain and financial functions this risk not only applies to us but also to third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our information from being vulnerable to theft loss damage or interruption from a number of potential sources or events we believe these measures and procedures 

cf industries holdings inc 

are appropriate however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate prevent or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks compromises to our information systems could have severe financial and other business implications 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations 

weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen based fertilizers colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for residential and industrial use in addition hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise 

we may not be able to complete our recently announced capacity expansion projects on schedule as planned on budget or at all due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

on november 1 2012 we announced that we will construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our complex in donaldsonville louisiana and new ammonia and urea units at our complex in port neal iowa our board of directors has authorized expenditures of 38 billion for the projects the design development construction and startup of the new plants are subject to a number of risks any of which could prevent us from completing the projects on schedule as planned and on budget or at all including cost overruns performance of third parties permitting matters adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor and raw material shortages transportation constraints engineering and construction change orders and other unforeseen difficulties 

the donaldsonville and port neal expansion projects are dependent on the availability and performance of the engineering firms construction firms equipment suppliers transportation providers and other vendors necessary to build the new units on a timely basis and on acceptable economic terms although we have entered into contracts with an affiliate of thyssenkrupp uhde for engineering and procurement services for each of the projects and we have procured bids from several construction firms we have not yet entered into definitive agreements for construction services for either project if thyssenkrupp uhde or any of the other third parties fails to perform as we expect our ability to meet our expansion goals would be affected 

we must also obtain numerous regulatory approvals and permits in order to construct and operate the additional plants these requirements may not be satisfied in a timely manner or at all our financial exposure to permitting risks may be exacerbated because we have committed to purchase certain equipment that will result in substantial expenditures prior to obtaining all permits necessary to operate the units in the event that we ultimately fail to obtain all necessary permits we would be forced to abandon the projects and lose the benefit of any construction costs already incurred in addition federal and state governmental requirements may increase our costs substantially which could 

cf industries holdings inc 

have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our expansion plans may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences such as the diversion of managements attention from our existing plants and businesses and other opportunities 

other expansions of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both domestically and in foreign locations major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments require significant managerial resources which may be diverted from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws regulations and permitting requirements as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act rcra cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes 

as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations additionally future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures additionally our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cf industries holdings inc 

from time to time our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses 

we may be impacted by the development of federal and state numeric nutrient criteria regulation on august 18 2009 the epa entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court judge on november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious the court ordered the epa to issue proposed or final numeric nutrient criteria for streams by may 21 2012 subject to the epa seeking an extension of such time period pursuant to the terms of the 2009 consent decree subsequently the court granted the epas motion to allow the epa to propose numeric nutrient criteria for streams by november 30 2012 and to finalize such criteria by august 31 2013 

in december 2011 the state of florida proposed its own numeric nutrient criteria for surface waters the nitrogen and phosphorous criteria in the proposed rule are substantially identical to the federal rule but the state proposal includes biological verification as a component of the criteria and adopts existing nutrient total maximum daily loads tmdl as applicable numeric criteria the impact of these modifications could be to provide more flexibility with respect to nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits so long as such discharges do not impair the biological health of receiving water bodies environmental groups filed a challenge to the proposed state rule but the rule was upheld by an administrative law judge on june 8 2012 and became final an appeal of the administrative decision upholding the rule is now pending before a florida appellate court 

on november 30 2012 the epa approved floridas rule however because the epa identified what it considered to be gaps in the scope of the waters covered by floridas rule and potential legal issues that might bar the florida rule from going into effect the epa pursuant to the court order described above has again proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida streams there is substantial uncertainty as to whether this rule will be withdrawn before it is finalized or if a rule is finalized as to the scope of florida inland flowing waters that will be covered by the epa regulation 

moreover notwithstanding the epas approval of the florida rule the federal criteria for lakes and inland waters previously upheld by the court excluding the criteria found to be arbitrary and capricious became effective on january 6 2013 the epa has proposed to stay the effective date of these criteria in light of the ongoing developments with the florida regulation 

the 2009 consent decree also requires the epa to develop numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the numeric criteria adopted by the state of florida and approved by the epa includes numeric criteria for some coastal and estuarine waters but as with streams epa has raised issues regarding the scope of coverage of floridas regulation accordingly on november 30 2012 the epa proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the epa must finalize these criteria by september 30 2013 unless future developments allow the epa to withdraw the rule 

cf industries holdings inc 

depending on the developments discussed herein federal or state numeric nutrient water quality criteria for florida waters could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining manufacturing and distribution operations in florida more stringent limits on wastewater discharge permits could increase our costs and limit our operations and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are dependent on numerous required permits approvals and meeting financial assurance requirements from governmental authorities 

we hold numerous environmental mining and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion of our operations is dependent upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in certain cases as a condition to procure such permits and approvals or as a condition to maintain existing approvals we may be required to comply with regulatory financial assurance requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure local state or federal government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care and reclamation at our facilities for example we have funded an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection fdep as a means of complying with floridas regulations governing financial assurance related to closure and postclosure of phosphogypsum stacks also pursuant to a consent decree with the us epa and the fdep we have funded a trust as a means of complying with similar requirements for closure post closure and monitoring of the phosphogypsum stack system at our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex 

florida regulations also mandate payment of certain mining taxes based on the quantity of ore mined and are subject to change based on local regulatory approvals additional financial assurance requirements or other increases in local mining regulations and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

florida regulations also require phosphate rock mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities the demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds letters of credit insurance policies or similar instruments it is possible that we will not be able to comply with either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

as of december 31 2012 the area permitted by local state and federal authorities for mining at our hardee phosphate complex contained approximately 422 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current operating rates for approximately 12 years we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated 347 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at

our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue or expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have secured the state environmental authorization to increase the capacity of our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city with the completion of our phase ii expansion that is currently being constructed this stack has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits including further expansion phases the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately six years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to greenhouse gas ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have significant impacts on the fertilizer industry due to the fact that our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than in the united states or canada our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us 

our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season 

if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are particularly 

cf industries holdings inc 

acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns causing an adverse change in operating results 

a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose this improves our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allows us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing assets 

under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date thereby significantly increasing our liquidity any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as of december 31 2012 and 2011 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders equaled approximately 17 and 21 respectively of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

we believe the ability to purchase product on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

we also sell phosphate products on a forward basis in 2012 forward sales of phosphate fertilizer products represented approximately 23 of our phosphate fertilizer volume unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products where we have the opportunity to fix or cap the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to do the same for the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate fertilizer costs as a result we are typically exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis 

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses 

we manage the risk of changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates using derivative instruments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes involving commodity price volatility adverse correlation of commodity prices or market liquidity issues 

in order to manage financial exposure to commodity price and market fluctuations we often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen based fertilizers we have used fixedprice forward 

cf industries holdings inc 

physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist 

our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or for which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties thereby negatively impacting our liquidity 

in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties established credit limits cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on derivative settlements 

our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage 

we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities 

our nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in seven separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represents approximately 40 of the companys ammonia production capacity our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on our phosphate 

cf industries holdings inc 

mine and associated beneficiation plant in hardee county florida our phosphate fertilizer complex in plant city florida and our ammonia terminal in tampa florida the suspension of operations at any of these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a number of our key facilities including the donaldsonville complex and all of our phosphate operations are located in regions of the united states that experience a relatively high level of hurricane activity such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas and sulfur in the gulf of mexico region 

we are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventures 

we participate in joint ventures including cfl which owns our facility in medicine hat alberta point lisas which owns a facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago growhow which owns facilities in billingham and ince united kingdom and keytrade a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near zurich switzerland our joint venture partners may share a measure of control over the operations of our joint ventures as a result our investments in joint ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our joint ventures or our partners have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions requests policies or objectives subject the joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business 

in addition we may become involved in disputes with our joint venture partners which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities our plants and ancillary facilities may be targets of terrorist activities many of these plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives local state federal and foreign governments could implement new regulations impacting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives it is possible that the us or foreign governments could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that such illicit use of our products could result in liability for the company 

cf industries holdings inc 

our operations and those of our joint ventures are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and an increase in the price or any delay or interruption in the delivery of these raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we and our joint ventures use natural gas ammonia and sulfur as raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase these raw materials from thirdparty suppliers prices for these raw materials can fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand we may not be able to pass along to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business these products are transported by barge truck rail or pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint ventures by thirdparty transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw materials including those caused by capacity constraints explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving pipelines deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime or labor difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations 

our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions during 2012 we derived approximately 14 of our net sales from outside of the united states our business operations include a 66 economic interest in cfl a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer in medicine hat alberta canada a 50 interest in an ammonia production joint venture in trinidad a 50 interest in a uk joint venture for the production of anhydrous ammonia and other fertilizer products and a 50 interest in a fertilizer trading operation headquartered near zurich switzerland 

our investments in securities are subject to risks that may result in losses 

our cash flows from operations have resulted in cash and cashequivalents of approximately 23 billion as of december 31 2012 we generally invest these cash and cashequivalents in what we believe to be relatively shortterm highly liquid and high credit quality instruments including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us government those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities our investments are subject to fluctuations in both market value and yield based upon changes in market conditions including interest rates liquidity general economic and credit market conditions and conditions specific to the issuers 

due to the risks of investments we may not achieve expected returns or may realize losses on our investments which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among 

cf industries holdings inc 

others conditions in the credit markets could impact the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories the overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted 

in addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizer significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact on the importation of fertilizers foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 

we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness or need to refinance existing indebtedness in the future which may adversely affect our operations 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 16 billion of total indebtedness consisting primarily of 800 million of our senior notes due in 2018 and 800 million of our senior notes due in 2020 we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing revolving credit facility of approximately 4910 million the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future our existing indebtedness and any additional debt we may incur in the future could have negative consequences on our business should operating cash flows be insufficient to cover debt service which would adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

from time to time we consider our options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the loss of key members of our management and professional staff may adversely affect our business 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our senior management and professional staff the loss of one or more key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally if we are unable to find hire and retain needed key personnel in the future our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

clean air act investigation 

on march 19 2007 the company received a letter from the epa under section 114 of the federal clean air act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with new source review new source performance standards and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants at the plant city facility the company provided the requested information to the epa in late 2007 the epa initiated this same process in relation to numerous other sulfuric acid plants and phosphoric acid plants throughout the nation including other facilities in florida 

the company received a notice of violation nov from the epa by letter dated june 16 2010 the nov alleges the company violated the prevention of significant deterioration psd clean air act regulations relating to certain projects undertaken at the plant city facilitys sulfuric acid plants this nov further alleges that the actions that are the basis for the alleged psd violations also resulted in violations of title v air operating permit regulations finally the nov alleges that the company failed to comply with certain compliance dates established by hazardous air pollutant regulations for phosphoric acid manufacturing plants and phosphate fertilizer production plants although this matter has been referred to the united states department of justice doj the company has continued to meet with the epa to discuss these alleged violations the company does not know at this time if it will settle this matter prior to initiation of formal legal action 

we cannot estimate the potential penalties fines or other expenditures if any that may result from the clean air act nov and therefore we cannot determine if the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows 

epcracercla investigation 

pursuant to a letter from the doj dated july 28 2008 that was sent to representatives of the major us phosphoric acid manufacturers including cf industries the doj stated that it and the epa believe that apparent violations of section 313 of the emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcra which requires annual reports to be submitted with respect to the use of 

cf industries holdings inc 

certain toxic chemicals have occurred at all of the phosphoric acid facilities operated by these manufacturers the letter also states that the doj and the epa believe that most of these facilities have violated section 304 of epcra and section 103 of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla by failing to provide required notifications relating to the release of hydrogen fluoride from these facilities the letter did not specifically identify alleged violations at our plant city florida complex or assert a claim for a specific amount of penalties the epa submitted an information request to the company on february 11 2009 as a followup to the july 2008 letter the company provided information in response to the agencys inquiry on may 14 and may 29 2009 

by letter dated july 6 2010 the epa issued a nov to the company alleging violations of epcra and cercla the company had an initial meeting with the epa to discuss these alleged violations the company does not know at this time if it will settle this matter prior to initiation of formal legal action

cfl selling price modification 

cf industries currently owns 49 of the voting common shares and 66 of the nonvoting preferred shares of canadian fertilizers limited cfl an alberta canadabased nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer and purchases 66 of the production of cfl pursuant to a product purchase agreement between cf industries and cfl viterra inc viterra holds 34 of cfls voting common shares and nonvoting preferred shares and purchases the remaining 34 of cfls production pursuant to a product purchase agreement between viterra and cfl cfl is a variable interest entity that is consolidated in our financial statements as a result the net sales the resulting earnings and the noncontrolling interest expense from the 34 of cfls sales that are made to viterra are included in our consolidated financial results there is no net impact of these cfl sales to viterra on our net earnings attributable to common stockholders since the net earnings from the 34 of cfls sales that are made to viterra are included in our earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest there is also no impact on our net cash flows since profits from the sales to viterra are paid to viterra as part of the distribution payable to the noncontrolling interest the net sales from cfl to viterra do impact our consolidated net sales gross margin operating earnings and earnings before income taxes 

under the provisions of cfls respective product purchase agreements with cf industries and viterra in effect until the fourth quarter of 2012 cfls selling prices were based on market prices an initial portion of the selling price was paid based upon production cost plus an agreedupon margin once title passed as the product was shipped the remaining portion of the selling price representing the difference between the market price and production cost plus an agreedupon margin was paid 

cf industries holdings inc 

after the end of the year the sales revenue attributable to this remaining portion of the selling price was accrued on an interim basis on our consolidated financial statements the net sales and accounts receivable attributable to cfl are generated solely by cfls transactions with viterra as cfls transactions with cf industries are eliminated in consolidation 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 the cfl board of directors approved an amendment to each of the respective product purchase agreements of cf industries and viterra with cfl the amendments modified the selling prices that cfl charges for products sold to cf industries and viterra the modified selling prices are based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin and are effective retroactively to january 1 2012 as a result of the january 1 2012 effective date of the amendment we recognized in our fourth quarter 2012 consolidated statement of operations a reduction in net sales revenue from viterra of 1297 million and a corresponding reduction in net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest to reverse the interim market price accruals recognized in the first three quarters of 2012 these items had no impact on our net earnings attributable to common stockholders but they did reduce each of our consolidated net sales gross margin operating earnings earnings before income taxes and net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest by 1297 million in the fourth quarter the selling price modification also had no impact on our net cash flows as the selling price modification was entirely offset by a change in distributions payable to the noncontrolling interest 

the cfl selling price modification effective retroactively to january 1 2012 affected the comparability between the 2012 and 2011 results for certain line items in our financial statements to provide comparable information for those periods we have included in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain financial information on an as adjusted basis as if all cfl sales to viterra had been priced based on the modified pricing calculation methodology production cost plus an agreedupon margin beginning january 1 2011 such information includes net sales gross margin net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest nitrogen net sales nitrogen gross margin nitrogen gross margin as a percentage of nitrogen net sales and average selling prices per ton of ammonia and urea tables highlighting these modifications can be found in the discussion of the results of consolidated operations and in the operating results for the nitrogen segment in each case under the heading impact of cfl selling price modifications financial results provided on an as adjusted basis in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to the items in those tables 

we report our financial results in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management believes that the presentation in this report of net sales gross margin net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest nitrogen net sales nitrogen gross margin nitrogen gross margin as a percentage of nitrogen net sales and average selling prices per ton of ammonia and urea on an as adjusted basis as if all cfl sales to viterra had been priced based on the modified pricing calculation methodology production cost plus an agreedupon margin beginning january 1 2011 and the presentation of periodtoperiod percentage changes in those adjusted items all of which adjusted items and percentage changes are nongaap financial measures provides investors with additional meaningful information to assess periodtoperiod changes in our underlying operating performance these nongaap financial measures are provided only for the purpose of facilitating comparisons between our 2012 and 2011 fullyear operating performance and do not purport to represent what our actual consolidated results of operations would have been had the amendment to the cfl product purchase agreements been in effect beginning on january 1 2011 nor are they necessarily indicative of our future consolidated results of operations nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap

• we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 18 billion in 2012 compared to net earnings of 15 billion in 2011 our 2012 results included a 746 million pretax unrealized net marktomarket gain 462 million after tax on natural gas and foreign currency derivatives a 152 million charge 94 million after tax for the accelerated amortization of deferred loan fees associated with the termination of our former senior secured credit agreement the 2010 credit agreement which was replaced by a new unsecured credit agreement dated may 1 2012 the 2012 credit agreement and a 109 million pretax curtailment gain 68 million after tax from a reduction in certain retiree medical benefits • diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders increased to 2859 in 2012 from 2198 in 2011 due to higher net earnings and lower average number of outstanding common shares due to our share repurchase program • net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 15 billion in 2011 included a 773 million pretax unrealized net marktomarket loss 480 million after tax on natural gas derivatives a 348 million pretax 216 million after tax noncash impairment charge related to our former woodward oklahoma methanol plant a 325 million 200 million after tax gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses 199 million 123 million after tax of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs recognized upon repayment of the remaining balance of the senior secured term loan in the first quarter of 2011 44 million 27 million after tax of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of terra and a 20 million 13 million after tax gain on the sale of a noncore transportation business • our gross margin increased 2177 million or 8 to 31 billion in 2012 from 29 billion in 2011 due primarily to an increase in the nitrogen segment partially offset by a decline in the phosphate segment the increase in gross margin is impacted by the modification of the cfl selling prices described above on an as adjusted basis the gross margin increase was 13 in the nitrogen segment gross margin increased by 3504 million or 14 driven by higher average selling prices unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in the current year compared to unrealized losses in the prior year and lower realized natural gas costs on an as adjusted basis the gross margin of the nitrogen segment increased 20 the favorable nitrogen segment results were partially offset by a 1327 million or 40 decrease in the phosphate segment gross margin driven primarily by lower average selling prices 

• our net sales were approximately 61 billion in both 2012 and 2011 slightly higher nitrogen segment sales were essentially offset by lower phosphate segment sales in the nitrogen segment net sales increased by 2 as higher average selling prices for ammonia and urea and higher 42

ammonia sales volume were partially offset by lower average uan selling prices and sales volume the comparability of nitrogen segment net sales is impacted by the 2012 modification of cfl selling prices on an as adjusted basis net sales in the nitrogen segment increased 5 in the phosphate segment net sales declined by 7 as higher sales volume was more than offset by a 12 decline in average selling prices 

• cash flow from operations was 24 billion in 2012 the 2967 million or 14 increase compared to 2011 was due mainly to additional cash generated by higher net earnings and an increase in customer advances • we paid cash dividends of 1027 million and 687 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase is due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to 040 per common share from 010 per common share which started in the third quarter of 2011 partially offset by a reduction in the number of outstanding shares • on august 2 2012 we entered into a definitive agreement with glencore international plc glencore to acquire the interests in cfl currently owned by viterra for total cash consideration of c09 billion subject to certain adjustments in october 2012 we entered into an agreement with each of growmark inc growmark and la coop fédérée to acquire the cfl common shares held by them when the transactions are completed we will own 100 of cfl and will be entitled to purchase 100 of cfls ammonia and urea production the completion of the transactions is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals in canada and other terms and conditions in the definitive purchase agreements cfls results are currently included in our financial statements as a consolidated variable interest entity • on november 1 2012 we announced plans to construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our complex in donaldsonville louisiana and new ammonia and urea plants at our complex in port neal iowa our board of directors authorized expenditures of 38 billion for the projects these projects will increase our production capacity increase our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville improve our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our costadvantaged port neal location and allow us to benefit from the global cost advantage of north american natural gas all of the new facilities are scheduled to be onstream by 2016 we expect to finance the capital expenditures through the use of cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and borrowings significant items 

robust demand in 2012 for nitrogen fertilizer products was due to favorable application conditions in both the spring and the fall near record corn acreage planted in 2012 and expectations of a similar level of acreage to be planted in 2013 high actual and expected planting levels were driven by record crop prices that resulted in record farm income these market conditions led to higher average selling prices in the nitrogen segment in 2012 that combined with lower natural gas costs resulted in record profitability average selling prices in our phosphate segment were down due to lower demand from india and additional production capacity notably from saudi arabia consolidated net sales of 61 billion in 2012 approximated the same level realized in 2011 as increases in the nitrogen segment due primarily to the higher average selling prices were offset by decreases in the phosphate segment due primarily to lower average selling prices in 2012 average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices increased by 2 but average phosphate fertilizer selling prices decreased by 12 gross margin increased by 2177 million or 8 to 31 billion in 2012 from 29 billion in 2011 nitrogen segment sales to viterra were made on a costplus basis in 2012 in contrast to the marketprice basis that applied in 

cf industries holdings inc 

2011 and prior years a difference that impacts the comparability of net sales and certain other items between 2012 and prior periods and is discussed above under the heading items affecting comparability of results—cfl selling price modification the 2012 results include 746 million 462 million after tax unrealized net marktomarket gains on natural gas and foreign currency derivatives a 152 million pretax charge 94 million after tax for the accelerated amortization of deferred fees on the 2010 credit agreement that we replaced in may 2012 and a 109 million pretax curtailment gain 68 million after tax from a reduction in certain retiree medical benefits 

in 2011 average selling prices increased due primarily to higher demand for fertilizer for the following reasons higher planted acres in the spring season due to strong demand for corn and other grains which supported favorable farm economics global fertilizer supply constraints resulting from both export restrictions and production curtailments affecting certain foreign fertilizer producers and an expected high level of planted acres and fertilizer usage in the 2012 growing season higher average selling prices and sales volumes due to increased demand led to robust operating results in 2011 consolidated net sales in 2011 increased by 21 billion or 54 to 61 billion with increases due primarily to higher average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments and higher sales volume due primarily to the impact of the terra acquisition in 2011 average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices increased by 38 and 36 respectively gross margin increased by 17 billion or 146 to 29 billion in 2011 from 12 billion in 2010 the 2011 results include a 773 million 480 million after tax unrealized net marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives results in 2011 also include 1455 million of net interest expense 902 million after tax a 348 million pretax 216 million after tax noncash impairment charge related to our woodward oklahoma methanol plant and a 325 million 200 million after tax gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses 

in april 2010 we completed the 46 billion acquisition of terra and it became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of cf holdings this acquisition made us a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer industry diversified our asset base and increased our geographic reach and operational efficiency as well as significantly increased our scale and capital market presence the financial results of the terra business are included in the consolidated results subsequent to the acquisition date consolidated net sales in 2010 were 40 billion up 52 as compared to 26 billion in 2009 due to the impact of the terra acquisition optimal weather conditions during both fertilizer application seasons and a favorable fertilizer environment due to strong farm economics while average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices declined by 11 in 2010 average phosphate fertilizer prices increased by 28 gross margin increased by 3401 million or 41 in 2010 to 11795 million the 2010 results include a 96 million 59 million after tax unrealized net marktomarket gain on natural gas derivatives results in 2010 also include 2198 million of net interest expense 1361 million after tax 1504 million 1488 million after tax of business combination expenses and peru project costs a 283 million gain 175 million after tax on the sale of terra common stock acquired during 2009 and 216 million 134 million after tax of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of terra

key industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our agricultural products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply  demand 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key consumingexporting countries such as china india and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs availability of raw materials government policies and global trade 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan and an because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america have declined over the last three years during the three year period ended december 31 2012 the average daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 751 per mmbtu on january 8 2010 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012 expenditures on natural gas including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 39 of the total cost of sales for our nitrogen fertilizer products in 2012 down from 45 in 2011 natural gas costs represented a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization 

farmers economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns and the types of crops planted 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of 

cf industries holdings inc 

credit and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters the development of natural gas reserves in north america over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the middle east the ukraine the republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa and china are major exporters to north america 

the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer and trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations 

political and social government policies 

the political and social policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports the subsidization of natural gas prices the subsidization of domestic producers and the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives 

factors affecting our results 

net sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost we report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward sales and customer advances later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment volatility in quarterly reported earnings also may arise from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of derivatives 

cf industries holdings inc 

selling general and administrative expenses our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees 

restructuring and integration costs restructuring and integration costs consist of expenses associated with the integration of the operations of terra and cf industries 

other operating—net other operating—net includes the costs associated with engineering studies for proposed capital projects and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations costs included in other costs can include foreign exchange gains and losses unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives costs associated with our closed facilities amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets in 2010 other operatingnet also included business combination related expenses and peru project development costs the business combination related expenses were associated with our acquisition of terra and costs associated with responding to agriums proposed acquisition of cf holdings see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on activity related to our acquisition of terra 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates we have investments accounted for under the equity method for which the results are included in our operating earnings these consist of the following 1 50 ownership interest in plnl and 2 50 interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in houston texas we include our share of the net earnings from these investments as an element of earnings from operations because these investments provide additional production and storage capacity to our operations and are integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities in the nitrogen segment our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition 

interest expense our interest expense includes the interest on our longterm debt and notes payable amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements and annual fees on our senior revolving credit facility it excludes capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects 

interest income our interest income represents amounts earned on our cash cash equivalents investments and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 

income tax provision our income tax provision includes all currently payable and deferred united states and foreign income tax expense applicable to our ongoing operations 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

in connection with our initial public offering ipo in august 2005 cf industries inc cfi ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for income tax purposes and we entered into a net operating loss agreement nol agreement with cfis preipo owners relating to the future utilization of our preipo net operating loss carryforwards nols the nol agreement provided that if we ultimately could utilize the preipo nols to offset applicable postipo taxable income we would pay our 

cf industries holdings inc 

preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved on january 2 2013 we and the preipo owners amended the nol agreement to provide among other things that we are entitled to retain 269 of any settlement realized with the united states internal revenue service irs at the irs appeals level in january 2013 we entered into a mediation report with the irs to resolve the tax treatment of the preipo nols pursuant to the mediation report we have agreed with the irs that we will be entitled to deduct a portion of the nols in future years our mediation agreement is subject to finalization in a closing agreement with the irs and will be recognized in our financial statements at that time under the terms of the amended nol agreement 731 of the federal and state tax savings will be payable to our preipo owners 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the entities in which we have an ownership interest and exert significant operational and financial influence income taxes related to these investments if any are reflected in this line the amounts recorded as equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes relate to our investments in growhow and keytrade our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition we account for these investments as nonoperating equity method investments and exclude the net earnings of these investments in earnings from operations since these operations do not provide additional production capacity to us nor are these operations integrated within our supply chain 

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest amounts reported as net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest represent the 34 interest in the net operating results of cfl and the 247 interest in the net operating results of tnclp a master limited partnership that owns the nitrogen manufacturing facility in verdigris oklahoma

impact of cfl selling price modifications 

as discussed in the items affecting comparability of results section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations during 2012 the cfl selling prices to viterra were modified to cost plus an agreedupon margin from marketbased pricing in the prior years this change had no impact on our net earnings attributable to common stockholders since net sales and net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest were each modified by the same amount however this change impacts the comparability of certain amounts between 2012 and 2011 the following table is presented to provide comparable information between 2012 and 2011 by presenting the 2011 information on a basis comparable with the 2012 data with respect to cfl selling prices 



year ended december 31 2012 compared to year ended december 31 2011 

consolidated operating results 

our total gross margin increased 2177 million or 8 to 31 billion in 2012 from 29 billion in 2011 due to an increase in gross margin in the nitrogen segment partially offset by a decrease in the phosphate segment the 8 gross margin increase was impacted by lower average cfl selling prices in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to the cfl selling price modification previously discussed on an as adjusted basis the gross margin increased 13 

in the nitrogen segment the gross margin increased by 3504 million or 14 to 29 billion as compared to 26 billion in 2011 due to an increase in average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices a decline in natural gas costs and unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in the current year as compared to unrealized losses in 2011 the 14 increase in nitrogen segment gross margin was impacted by lower average cfl selling prices in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to the cfl selling price modification previously discussed on an as adjusted basis the gross margin for the nitrogen segment increased 20 

cf industries holdings inc 

in the phosphate segment gross margin decreased by 1327 million or 40 to 1997 million in 2012 from 3324 million in 2011 due primarily to lower average phosphate fertilizer selling prices partially offset by an increase in sales volume 

net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 18 billion for 2012 included a 746 million pretax unrealized net marktomarket gain 462 million after tax on natural gas and foreign currency derivatives a 152 million charge 94 million after tax for the accelerated amortization of deferred loan fees on our 2010 credit agreement that we replaced in may 2012 and a 109 million pretax curtailment gain 68 million after tax from a reduction in certain retiree medical benefits 

the net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 15 billion for 2011 included a 773 million pretax unrealized net marktomarket loss 480 million after tax on natural gas derivatives a 348 million pretax 216 million after tax noncash impairment charge related to our woodward oklahoma methanol plant a 325 million 200 million after tax gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses 199 million 123 million after tax of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs recognized upon repayment of the remaining balance of the senior secured term loan in the first quarter of 2011 44 million 27 million after tax of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of terra and a 20 million 13 million after tax gain on the sale of a noncore transportation business 

net sales 

net sales were 61 billion in both 2012 and 2011 as increases in the nitrogen segment in 2012 were offset by declines in the phosphate segment these results were impacted by lower average cfl selling prices in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to the cfl selling price modification on an as adjusted basis net sales increased 2 

in the nitrogen segment net sales increased by 845 million or 2 due primarily to higher nitrogen fertilizer average selling prices which were partially offset by lower sales volume average selling prices for nitrogen fertilizer increased due primarily to positive market conditions as favorable weather created a longer application window tight world market conditions existed for ammonia and urea due to lower international ammonia production and tight domestic supply conditions existed due to increased demand caused by the high level of planted acres and low downstream inventories the 2 increase in nitrogen segment net sales was impacted by lower average cfl selling prices in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to the cfl selling price modification on an as adjusted basis net sales in the nitrogen segment increased 5 

in the phosphate segment net sales declined 784 million or 7 due to a 12 decline in average phosphate fertilizer selling prices partially offset by a 6 increase in phosphate sales volume 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales in our nitrogen segment averaged approximately 168 per ton in 2012 compared to 188 per ton in 2011 this 11 decrease was due primarily to lower realized natural gas cost and a 665 million unrealized net marktomarket gain on natural gas derivatives in the current year compared to a 773 million unrealized net loss in the prior year phosphate segment cost of sales averaged 397 per ton in 2012 compared to 392 per ton in the prior year 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 218 million to 1518 million in 2012 from 1300 million in 2011 due primarily to higher corporate office expenses including higher professional 

cf industries holdings inc 

service fees associated with the design and implementation of a new enterprise resource planning erp system and higher outside legal fees and employee incentive compensation costs the higher legal costs were primarily associated with environmental regulatory costs and corporate activities including our planned acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in cfl and capacity expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa 

restructuring and integration costs 

no restructuring and integration costs were incurred in 2012 compared to 44 million in 2011 as integration activities associated with the acquisition of terra were completed in 2011 

other operating—net 

other operating—net was 491 million in 2012 compared to 209 million in 2011 the expense recorded in 2012 consisted primarily of 219 million of costs associated with engineering studies for capacity expansion projects at various nitrogen complexes 133 million of environmental and other costs associated with our closed facilities and 55 million of losses on the disposal of fixed assets the expense recorded in 2011 included a 348 million impairment charge related to our woodward oklahoma methanol plant 81 million of costs associated with our closed facilities and losses of 72 million on the disposal of fixed assets partially offset by a 325 million gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses and a 20 million gain on the sale of a noncore transportation business 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates consists of our 50 share of the operating results of plnl and our 50 interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in houston texas equity in earnings of operating affiliates decreased 32 million to 470 million in 2012 as compared to 502 million in 2011 due primarily to reduced sales and earnings at plnl due to a planned turnaround which was partially offset by improved sales and earnings for the ammonia storage joint venture 

interest—net 

net interest expense was 1310 million in 2012 compared to 1455 million in 2011 the decrease in expense was due primarily to a decrease in amortized loan fees including a 47 million decrease in accelerated loan fee amortization in 2012 we terminated the 2010 credit agreement and recognized 152 million accelerated amortization of deferred loan fees in 2011 we repaid the remaining balance of our senior secured term loan and recognized 199 million accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs 

income taxes 

our income tax provision for 2012 was 9642 million on pretax income of 28 billion or an effective tax rate of 341 compared to an income tax provision of 9265 million on a pretax income of 26 billion and an effective tax rate of 350 in 2011 the decline in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by lower us taxes on foreign earnings as well as lower state taxes in 2012 than in the prior year the effective tax rate does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests in tnclp a partnership which does not record an income tax provision on august 2 2012 we entered into a definitive agreement with glencore international plc glencore to acquire the interest in cfl currently owned by viterra as a result cfl recorded an income tax 

cf industries holdings inc 

provision in 2012 in 2011 cfl did not record an income tax provision see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes consists of our share of the operating results of unconsolidated joint venture interests in growhow and keytrade the 162 million increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to higher net earnings at growhow due to improved operating results declines in uk corporate tax rates and an 111 million insurance settlement related to a fire that occurred in 2011 

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest 

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest include the interest of the 34 holder of cfls common and preferred shares and the net earnings attributable to the 247 interest of the publicly held common units of tnclp the 1471 million decrease was mainly due to the impact of the cfl selling price modification that was made in 2012 during each quarter of 2012 and 2011 the tnclp minimum quarterly distribution was exceeded which entitled us to receive increased distributions on our general partner interests as provided for in the tnclp agreement of limited partnership for additional information see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders increased to 2859 in 2012 from 2198 in 2011 due to an increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders and a decrease in the weighted average number of shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program under which we repurchased 65 million shares of our common stock in 2011 and an additional 31 million shares in 2012 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

consolidated operating results 

our total gross margin increased 17 billion or 146 to 29 billion for the year ended december 31 2011 from 12 billion in 2010 due to increases in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments in the nitrogen segment the gross margin increased by 16 billion to 26 billion for 2011 compared to 10 billion in 2010 due primarily to higher average selling prices the acquisition of terra the results of which were included for four quarters in 2011 and three quarters in 2010 and lower realized natural gas costs these results were partially offset by unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives in 2011 compared to unrealized gains in 2010 in the phosphate segment gross margin increased by 1796 million to 3324 million for 2011 compared to 1528 million for 2010 due primarily to higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices partially offset by higher raw material costs namely sulfur and ammonia 

the net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 15 billion for 2011 included a 773 million pretax unrealized net marktomarket loss 480 million after tax on natural gas derivatives a 348 million pretax 216 million after tax noncash impairment charge related to our woodward oklahoma methanol plant a 325 million 200 million after tax gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses 199 million 123 million after tax of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs recognized upon repayment of the remaining balance of the senior secured term loan in the first quarter of 2011 44 million 27 million after tax of restructuring and integration costs

associated with the acquisition of terra and a 20 million 13 million after tax gain on the sale of a noncore transportation business 

the 2010 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 3492 million included 2198 million 1361 million after tax of net interest expense including 859 million 531 million after tax of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount recognized upon repayment of the senior secured bridge loan and partial repayment of the senior secured term loan 1504 million 1488 million after tax of business combination related expenses and peru project development costs a 283 million 175 million after tax gain on the sale of 50 million shares of terra common stock 216 million 134 million after tax of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of terra a 194 million 120 million after tax noncash charge in cost of sales recognized upon the sale of terras product inventory due to revaluing it to fair value under purchase accounting a loss of 170 million 105 million after tax on the early retirement of terras 2019 notes and a 96 million pretax unrealized net marktomarket gain 59 million after tax on natural gas derivatives 

net sales 

our net sales increased 54 to 61 billion in the year ended december 31 2011 from 40 billion in 2010 this 21 billion increase was due to higher nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer average selling prices and sales volumes including the impact of the terra acquisition average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices increased by 38 and 36 respectively average selling prices increased due primarily to higher demand for fertilizer for the following reasons higher planted acres in the spring season due to strong demand for corn and other grains which supported favorable farm economics global fertilizer supply constraints resulting from both export restrictions and production curtailments at certain foreign fertilizer producers and expected high planted acres and fertilizer usage in the 2012 growing season total sales volume increased 16 million tons or 12 in 2011 to 149 million tons as compared to 133 million tons in 2010 as higher uan and an sales volumes due to the impact of the terra acquisition and phosphate fertilizer sales volumes were partially offset by lower ammonia sales volume 

cost of sales 

average cost of sales in our nitrogen segment of 188 per ton in 2011 approximated 2010 as lower realized natural gas costs in 2011 were offset by unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives phosphate segment cost of sales averaged 392 per ton in 2011 compared to 335 per ton in the prior year an increase of 17 due primarily to higher sulfur and ammonia costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 239 million to 1300 million in 2011 from 1061 million in 2010 due primarily to higher professional service fees costs associated with the design and implementation of a new erp system and higher performancebased incentive compensation 

restructuring and integration costs 

restructuring and integration costs decreased 172 million to 44 million in 2011 from 216 million in 2010 as integration activities associated with the acquisition of terra declined substantially and were completed in 2011

other operating—net 

other operating—net decreased 1458 million to 209 million in 2011 compared to 1667 million in 2010 the 209 million of expense recorded in 2011 consists primarily of the following items a 348 million impairment charge related to our woodward oklahoma methanol plant a 325 million gain that was recognized on the sale of four dryproduct warehouses 81 million of costs associated with our closed facilities losses of 72 million on the disposal of fixed assets and a 20 million gain on the sale of a noncore transportation business 

the woodward oklahoma methanol plant was part of a nitrogen complex that was acquired with the terra acquisition the woodward complex could produce both nitrogen based fertilizers and methanol based on a strategic review that was completed in the third quarter of 2011 the woodward complex will focus on fertilizer production as a result management approved the permanent shutdown removed the methanol plant and recognized the impairment charge 

the expense in 2010 is primarily business combination costs associated with our acquisition of terra including a 1230 million termination fee paid to yara international asa in the first quarter of 2010 and project development costs 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates 

equity in earnings of operating affiliates in 2011 and 2010 consists of our 50 share of the operating results of plnl and our 50 interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in houston texas the 396 million increase in 2011 compared to 2010 is due to improved plnl operating results due primarily to higher ammonia prices caused by a strong international market 

interest—net 

net interest expense was 1455 million in 2011 compared to 2198 million in 2010 the financing costs of the terra acquisition including the accelerated amortization of debt fees impacted both 2010 and 2011 in the second quarter of 2010 we financed the terra acquisition with a senior secured bridge loan a senior secured term loan and senior notes the senior secured bridge loan and a portion of the senior secured term loan were repaid over the last three quarters of 2010 and accelerated loan fee amortization of 859 was recognized in 2010 in the first quarter of 2011 the remaining balance of the senior secured term loan was repaid in full and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs of 199 million was recognized 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

loss on extinguishment of debt in 2010 consisted of the 170 million loss on the early retirement of terras 2019 notes this amount represents the difference between the amount paid to settle the debt of 7445 million and the fair value of the notes on april 5 2010 of 7275 million as the notes were recognized at fair value under purchase accounting

cf industries holdings inc 

9265 million and reported pretax income of 26 billion was 350 this compares to 398 in the prior year the decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from a decrease in nondeductible costs associated with our acquisition of terra and peru project development activities partially offset by higher us taxes related to foreign operations the effective tax rate does not include tax provisions on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests in tnclp and cfl which recorded no income tax provisions see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes 

equity in earnings of nonoperating affiliates—net of taxes for 2011 and 2010 consists of our share of the operating results of unconsolidated joint venture interests in growhow and keytrade the 152 million increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was due primarily to higher growhow earnings resulting from a strong uk nitrogen fertilizer market 

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest 

amounts reported as net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests include the interest of the 34 holder of cfls common and preferred shares and the net earnings attributable to the 247 interest of the publicly held common units of tnclp during all four quarters of 2011 and the last three quarters of 2010 the tnclp minimum quarterly distribution was exceeded which entitled us to receive increased distributions on our general partner interests as provided for in the tnclp agreement of limited partnership for additional information see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders increased to 2198 per share in 2011 from 534 per share in 2010 due primarily to the increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders partially offset by an increase in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding in april 2010 we issued 95 million shares of our common stock in connection with the terra acquisition and 129 million shares in the subsequent public offering during the last half of 2011 we repurchased 65 million shares

impact of cfl selling price modifications 

as discussed in the items affecting comparability of results section of the management discussion and analysis during 2012 the cfl selling prices to viterra were modified to cost plus an agreedupon margin from marketbased pricing in the prior years this change had no impact on our net earnings attributable to common stockholders since net sales and net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest were each modified by the same amount however this change impacts the comparability of certain amounts between 2012 and 2011 the following table is presented to provide comparable information between 2012 and 2011 by presenting the 2011 information on a basis comparable with the 2012 data with respect to cfl selling prices 



year ended december 31 2012 compared to year ended december 31 2011 

net sales net sales in the nitrogen segment increased 845 million or 2 to 51 billion in 2012 from 50 billion in 2011 due primarily to a 2 increase in average selling prices the 2012 nitrogen segment net sales were impacted by lower average cfl selling prices as compared to 2011 due to the cfl selling price modification described earlier on an as adjusted basis net sales in the nitrogen segment increased 5 average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices increased to 393 per ton in 2012 from 385 per ton in 2011 with increases in ammonia and urea higher ammonia and urea average selling prices resulted from tight industrywide supply conditions due to increased us demand 

cf industries holdings inc 

caused by the higher level of planted acres in 2012 and expected in 2013 and lower downstream inventories sales volume in 2012 approximated the level in 2011 as higher sales of ammonia and other nitrogen products were offset by lower sales volumes of uan and ammonium nitrate a favorable application environment for ammonia during 2012 supported the higher sales volume for this product the lower sales volumes of uan and ammonia nitrate were due to scheduled plant turnaround and maintenance activities during 2012 that resulted in lower production of these products lower uan sales volume was also due to a shift in product mix favoring higher margin nitrogen products during the year 

cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged approximately 168 per ton in 2012 compared to 188 per ton in 2011 the 11 decrease was due primarily to lower realized natural gas costs and 665 million in unrealized net marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in 2012 compared to net losses of 773 million in 2011 the average cost of natural gas declined by 21 from 428 per mmbtu in 2011 to 339 per mmbtu in 2012 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

net sales nitrogen segment net sales increased 18 billion or 57 to 50 billion in 2011 compared to 32 billion in 2010 due primarily to higher average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices and uan and an sales volume partially offset by lower ammonia sales volume average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices increased to 385 per ton in 2011 from 278 per ton in 2010 with increases across all products strong demand for the spring application season due to an increase in planted acres depleted supplies available at both the producer and customer level due to strong demand global supply constraints and expectations that 2012 planted acres will remain at historically high levels resulted in higher average selling prices nitrogen fertilizer sales volume in 2011 increased 15 million tons from 2010 due primarily to higher uan and an sales volumes partially offset by lower ammonia sales volume uan sales volume increased significantly during 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to the acquisition of terra and the increased supply available from the woodward oklahoma uan plant expansion the increased uan production capacity allowed us to meet increased demand for uan resulting from favorable spring application conditions and customers replenishing depleted downstream inventories after the strong spring application season the increase in an sales in 2011 from the prior year is due to the inclusion of a full year of an sales in 2011 as the production capacity for this product was obtained in the terra acquisition the 2011 decrease in ammonia sales is due primarily to the additional ammonia required to support the production from the uan plant expansion at woodward 

cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged approximately 188 per ton in 2011 compared to 189 per ton in 2010 lower realized natural gas costs in 2011 were offset by unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives we recognized a 773 million unrealized net marktomarket loss in 2011 compared to a 96 million unrealized net marktomarket gain in 2010

year ended december 31 2012 compared to year ended december 31 2011 

net sales phosphate segment net sales decreased 784 million or approximately 7 to 10 billion in 2012 compared to 11 billion in 2011 due to lower average selling prices partially offset by higher sales volume average selling prices for 2012 decreased by 12 compared to the prior year reflecting lower demand from india and additional production capacity notably from saudi arabia our total sales volume of phosphate fertilizer of 20 million tons in 2012 was 6 higher than in 2011 due primarily to higher export sales volume 

cost of sales average phosphate segment cost of sales of 397 per ton in 2012 was comparable to the 392 per ton in the prior year 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

net sales phosphate segment net sales increased 3083 million to 11 billion in 2011 from 7775 million in 2010 due to higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices and sales volume average phosphate fertilizer selling prices for 2011 increased by 36 compared to the prior year resulting from supply constraints in the international market and strong domestic demand for the 

cf industries holdings inc 

spring application season our total volume of phosphate fertilizer sales increased 3 to 19 million tons in 2011 due primarily to increased planted corn acres favorable farmlevel economics during the spring application season and increased export sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 in response to weakness in the domestic market 

cost of sales phosphate segment cost of sales averaged 392 per ton in 2011 compared to 335 per ton in the prior year the 17 increase was due primarily to higher raw material costs for sulfur and ammonia 

liquidity and capital resources 

generally our primary source of cash is cash from operations which includes cash generated by customer advances our primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs working capital capital expenditures debt service investments taxes share repurchases and dividends our working capital requirements are affected by several factors including demand for our products selling prices raw material costs freight and storage costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business 

during 2012 we announced the following events that have or will have an impact on our cash and liquidity position 

• in june 2012 we completed the remaining portion of the 15 billion share repurchase program announced in august 2011 • in august 2012 our board of directors authorized an additional 3 billion share repurchase program • in august 2012 we announced our agreement to acquire the 34 interest in cfl that is held by viterra inc for c09 billion subject to regulatory approval and certain closing conditions and • in november 2012 our board of directors authorized expenditures of 38 billion to construct new ammonia urea and uan plants at two of our existing manufacturing complexes in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa further details regarding these announcements are provided below 

cash and cash equivalents 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 23 billion and 12 billion as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less under our shortterm investment policy we may invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us and canadian federal governments those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities 

share repurchase programs 

in the third quarter of 2011 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 15 billion of cf holdings common stock through december 31 2013 during 2011 we repurchased 65 million shares under the program for 10 billion and in the second quarter of 2012 we repurchased 31 million shares of cf holdings common stock for 5000 million thereby completing this program in june 2012 all 96 million shares that had been repurchased under this program were

retired in our consolidated balance sheet the retirement of these shares eliminated the recorded treasury stock and reduced retained earnings and paidin capital by 11259 million and 3742 million respectively as of june 30 2012 

in the third quarter of 2012 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 30 billion of cf holdings common stock through december 31 2016 repurchases under this program may be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise the manner timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by our management based on evaluation of market conditions stock price and other factors there were no repurchases under this program in 2012 

major capital expansion projects 

in november 2012 we announced plans to construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex our board of directors authorized expenditures of 38 billion for these projects in combination these two new facilities will be able to produce 21 million tons of gross ammonia per year and upgraded products ranging from 20 to 27 million tons of granular urea per year and up to 18 million tons of uan 32 solution per year depending on product mix the 38 billion cost estimate includes engineering and design equipment procurement construction associated infrastructure including natural gas connections power supply and product storage and handling systems these plants will increase our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville improve our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location and allow us to benefit from the favorable pricing advantage of north american natural gas all of these new facilities are scheduled to be onstream by 2016 we expect to finance the capital expenditures through the use of cash and shortterm investments cash generated from operations and borrowings during the fourth quarter of 2012 we incurred capital expenditures of 1208 million on these projects contributing to the increase in capital expenditures in 2012 over those in 2011 

we have retained engineering and procurement services from thyssenkrupp uhde uhde through their affiliate uhde corporation of america for both the donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa expansion projects under the terms of the uhde contract we are required to establish a separate cash account and grant a security interest in the account to uhde we are required to maintain in this account a cash balance equal to the cancellation fees for procurement services and equipment that would arise if we were to cancel these projects the amount of cash in the account will change over time based on procurement costs and is projected to reach approximately 500 million at certain points in time during the life of the projects at december 31 2012 there was no cash held in this account cash placed in this account in the future will be considered restricted cash since a security interest in the account has been granted to uhde this restricted cash will not be included in our cash and cash equivalents and will be reported separately on our consolidated balance sheet 

capital spending 

capital expenditures totaled 5235 million in 2012 as compared to 2472 million in 2011 and 2581 million in 2010 the increase in 2012 capital expenditures is primarily the result of the 1208 million capital expenditures for the two major capital expansion projects discussed above plus certain capital improvement projects at our production facilities capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements 

cf industries holdings inc 

projected capital spending 

we expect to spend between 14 billion and 17 billion on capital projects during 2013 of which 10 billion to 13 billion relates to the major capital expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa discussed above planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting unanticipated increases in the cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints and other unforeseen difficulties 

acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in canadian fertilizers limited 

in august 2012 we entered into an agreement to acquire the 34 of cfls common and preferred shares owned by viterra and the product purchase agreement between viterra and cfl for a total purchase price of c09 billion subject to certain adjustments see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding cfl in october 2012 we entered into an agreement with each of growmark and la coop fédérée to acquire the cfl common shares held by them as a result of these transactions we will own 100 of cfl and will be entitled to purchase 100 of cfls ammonia and granular urea production the completion of these transactions is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals in canada and other terms and conditions in the definitive agreements 

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

we have operations in canada and interests in corporate joint ventures in the united kingdom the republic of trinidad and tobago and switzerland the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us are recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings are recognized unless the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested based upon our current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurs at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings can occur in different periods cash balances held by corporate joint ventures are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint ventures on a periodic basis 

at december 31 2012 approximately 8860 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 23 billion was held by our canadian subsidiaries it is expected that a significant portion of this cash balance will be used to fund the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in cfl noted above if the transaction is completed the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represents accumulated earnings of our foreign operations which is not considered to be permanently reinvested we have recognized deferred income taxes on these earnings for the foreign and domestic taxes that would be due upon their repatriation to the united states at december 31 2012 the cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian cash balances would be approximately 45 million depending upon how we implement the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in cfl some or all of the canadian cash balances may be repatriated to the us resulting in the payment of the applicable portion of the foreign taxes on the repatriation 

debt 

at both december 31 2012 and 2011 we had 16 billion of senior notes outstanding in two series of 800 million each the first series carries an interest rate of 6875 and is due in the aggregate in 2018 the second series carries an interest rate of 7125 and is due in the aggregate in 2020 at 

cf industries holdings inc 

december 31 2011 we also had 130 million of terra 7 senior notes due 2017 which were redeemed in the second quarter of 2012 

as of december 31 2012 4910 million was available for borrowing under our credit agreement net of 90 million of outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings our 2012 credit agreement includes representations warranties covenants and events of default including requirements that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio as well as other customary covenants and events of default our senior notes indentures also include certain covenants and events of default as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2012 credit agreement and the senior notes indentures 

forward sales and customer advances 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers as a result of using derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives and our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment unlike nitrogen fertilizer products sold under forward sales contracts we typically are unable to use hedges to reduce our exposure to raw material price changes for components of our phosphate manufacturing cost the largest of which are sulfur and ammonia as a result we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis 

customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which may be several months after the order is placed as is the case for all of our sale transactions revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had approximately 3807 million and 2572 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets 

while customer advances were a significant source of liquidity in both 2012 and 2011 the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals the level of forward orders may reflect our customers views of the current fertilizer pricing environment and expectations regarding future pricing and availability of supply 

under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales we may also be subject to storage charges under these arrangements should we be unable to deliver product at the specified time if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase also borrowing under our senior revolving credit facility could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our 

cf industries holdings inc 

business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity 

derivative financial instruments 

we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts the counterparties to our derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions cash collateral is deposited with or received from counterparties when predetermined unrealized loss or gain thresholds are exceeded for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties individual credit limits monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements 

the master netting arrangements to some of our derivative instruments also contain creditriskrelated contingent features that require us to maintain minimum net worth levels and certain financial ratios if we fail to meet these minimum requirements the counterparties to those derivative instruments where we hold liability positions could require daily cash settlement of unrealized losses or some other form of credit support 

as of december 31 2012 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position was 09 million we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts as of december 31 2012 

financial assurance requirements 

in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment we are also subject to financial assurance requirements related to the closure and maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at both our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex and our former bartow florida phosphate fertilizer complex there are two sources of these financial assurance requirements first in 2010 we entered into a consent decree with the us environmental protection agency epa and the florida department of environmental protection fdep with respect to our compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra at our plant city florida complex the plant city consent decree second the state of florida financial assurance regulations florida financial assurance apply to both our plant city and bartow complexes both of these regulations allow the use of a funding mechanism as a means of complying with the financial assurance requirements associated with the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stacks as well as costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure we have established a trust account for the benefit of the epa and fdep and an escrow account for the benefit of the fdep to meet these financial assurance requirements on our consolidated balance sheet these are collectively referred to as asset retirement obligation funds aro funds in october 2012 we deposited 530 million into the trust for the plant city consent decree thereby reaching full funding of that obligation and we expect to fund the remaining approximately 40 million of the state of florida financial assurance escrow account near the end of 2015 both financial assurance funding obligations require estimates of future expenditures that could be impacted by refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation changes in regulations discount rates and the timing of activities additional funding will be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed investment earnings in the trust or escrow accounts at december 31 2012 and 2011 the balance in the aro funds was 2008 million and 1454 million respectively 

cf industries holdings inc 

the amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack systems closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements these expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the trust and escrow accounts which are based on the guidelines set forth in the plant city consent decree and florida financial assurance regulations ultimately the funds in these accounts will be used to fund the closure and maintenance of the phosphogypsum stack systems 

florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities we will also be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted the demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a trust fund agreement or escrow account based on these current regulations we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in florida utilizing any of these methods 

acquisition of terra

cash flows 

operating activities 

year ended december 31 2012 compared to year ended december 31 2011 

net cash generated from operating activities in 2012 was 24 billion as compared to 21 billion in 2011 the 2967 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to an increase in net earnings from the nitrogen segment and a lower level of working capital invested in the business at the end of 2012 as compared to the end of 2011 as lower inventory lower receivables and 

cf industries holdings inc 

higher customer advances and accounts payable and accrued expenses contributed to the lower levels of working capital 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

net cash generated from operating activities in 2011 was 21 billion as compared to 12 billion in 2010 the 8845 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to improved net earnings in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments partially offset by lower customer advances and an increase in cash invested in inventory and accounts receivable in 2011 compared to 2010 

investing activities 

years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

net cash used in investing activities was 5135 million in 2012 compared to 1738 million in 2011 the cash used in investing activities in 2012 was primarily for capital expenditures partially offset by 654 million from the sale of short term securities and property plant and equipment the cash used in investing activities in 2011 was primarily for capital expenditures partially offset by 547 million in proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment and 379 million in sales and maturities of short term securities the proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment in 2011 primarily related to the sale of four dry product warehouses and a noncore transportation business the 31 billion in cash used in investing activities in 2010 was due primarily to the net cash consideration of 32 billion for the acquisition of terra partially offset by 2096 million of cash provided by net sales of shortterm investments and redemptions of auction rate securities and proceeds of 1671 million from the sale of terra common stock prior to the acquisition of terra additions to property plant and equipment accounted for 5235 million 2472 million and 2581 million of cash used in investing activities in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in capital expenditures in 2012 related primarily to cash spending of 1208 million for the major capital expansion projects at our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa facilities plus certain other significant capital projects at our existing production complexes to sustain our asset base increase our production capacity improve plant efficiency and comply with various environmental health and safety requirements 

we made contributions of 554 million 504 million and 585 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively to our asset retirement obligation trust and escrow accounts the balance in these accounts is reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 

financing activities 

years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

net cash used in financing activities was 7968 million in 2012 compared to 15 billion in 2011 in 2012 we repurchased 5000 million of our common stock and distributed 2318 million to the noncontrolling interests we repurchased 10 billion of our common stock and distributed 1457 million to the noncontrolling interests in 2011 in 2012 130 million was used for the repayment of long term debt compared to 3460 million in 2011 dividends paid on common stock increased to 1027 million in 2012 from 687 million in 2011 due to the increase in the common dividend to 040 per share from 010 per share which started in the third quarter of 2011 partially offset by a reduction in number of outstanding shares net cash provided by financing activities in 2010 of 20 billion was due primarily to 52 billion of proceeds from the issuance of debt and 12 billion from the issuance of common stock in a public offering associated with our acquisition of terra 

cf industries holdings inc 

partially offset by 40 billion of prepayments on our debt and 02 billion of financing fees dividends paid on common stock were 262 million in 2010 and we also paid 200 million of dividends declared by terra prior to the acquisition date we also paid distributions to our noncontrolling interests of 1170 million in 2010

other longterm obligations 

as of december 31 2012 our other liabilities included balances related to asset retirement obligations aros and environmental remediation liabilities the estimated timing and amount of cash outflows associated with these liabilities are as follows 



1 represents the undiscounted inflationadjusted estimated cash outflows required to settle the recorded aros the corresponding present value of these future expenditures is 1450 million as of december 31 2012 excludes any amounts we may be required to deposit into our escrow or trust accounts to meet our financial assurance funding requirements see the discussion of our financial assurance requirements earlier in this section we also have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included is reclamation of land and closure of effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2012 dollars is approximately 510 million we do not believe that there is a reasonable basis for currently estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities therefore the table above does not contain any payments for these aros see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our aros as described in financial assurance requirements we intend to set aside cash on an annual basis in escrow and trust accounts established to cover costs associated with closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems as required these accounts will be the source of a significant portion of the cash required to settle the aros pertaining to the phosphogypsum stack systems

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer the rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to ten years and the barge charter commitments currently have terms ranging from one to seven years we also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system some of which contain minimum throughput requirements the storage agreements contain minimum terms ranging from one to three years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party see note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning leases 

we do not have any other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

cf industries holdings inc 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation depletion and amortization is computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews 

scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher production costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line entitled additions to property plant and equipment 

inventory valuation 

we review our inventory balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our most recent estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales 

asset retirement obligations aros and environmental remediation liabilities 

aros are legal obligations associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the bartow and plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complexes land reclamation activities at our hardee florida phosphate rock mine and the cessation of operations at all of our facilities if the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated aros are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service we are required to recognize an aro for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain the obligations at active facilities related to closure reclamation 

cf industries holdings inc 

and cessation of operations are capitalized at their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded the liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time the asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over the estimated useful life in the case of reclamation the asset is depreciated over the period the mining occurs which in some cases may be after initial recognition of the liability the aggregate carrying value of all of our aros was 1450 million as of december 31 2012 and 1316 million as of december 31 2011 the increase in the aggregate carrying value of these aros is due to normal accretion expense and the recognition of new obligations partially offset by cash expenditures on aros and reductions in previous estimates 

environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts existing technology sitespecific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations in reporting environmental liabilities no offset is made for potential recoveries all liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur in accordance with gaap environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits changes in laws regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements the amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled 59 million as of december 31 2012 and 67 million as of december 31 2011 

the actual amounts to be spent on aros and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments and cost inflation as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes we are also required to select discount rates to calculate the present value of aros changes in these estimates or the selection of a different discount rate could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

we have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2012 dollars is 510 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros at december 31 2012 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion 

recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in accordance with gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are 

cf industries holdings inc 

consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review 

the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired we review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries annually to determine if there is a loss in value of the investment we determine the fair value of the investment using an income approach valuation method if the sum of the expected future discounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized immediately 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the nitrogen and phosphate segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an income based valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2012 or 2011 reviews as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the carrying value of our goodwill resulting mainly from the terra acquisition was 21 billion 

fair value measurements 

we have classified our investments in auction rate securities included in other assets as those measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 securities under the provisions of the current rules for assessing fair value no other assets or liabilities are classified as level 3 items on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2012 see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning fair value measurements 

derivative financial instruments 

the accounting for the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and whether the instrument is effective as part of a hedging relationship changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments considered effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as the changes occur and are reclassified into income or expense as the hedge item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as the changes occur 

cf industries holdings inc 

certain of our foreign currency derivatives that we use to manage our exposure to changes in exchange rates on eurodenominated expenditures associated with our capital expansion projects have been designated as cash flow hedges the expected cash flows for the capital projects involve the use of judgments and estimates which are subject to change we assess both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the designated cash flow hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable hedge accounting is discontinued in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting 

income taxes 

we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period when these changes occur 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

a deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which are considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income tax liability is recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested 

as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods 

in connection with our ipo in august 2005 cfi ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for income tax purposes and we entered into an nol agreement with cfis preipo owners relating to the future utilization of the preipo nols the nol agreement provided that if we ultimately could utilize the preipo nols to offset applicable postipo taxable income we would pay our preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved on january 2 2013 we and the preipo owners amended the nol agreement to provide among other things that 

cf industries holdings inc 

we are entitled to retain 269 of any settlement realized with the irs at the irs appeals level see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the utilization of the nols 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 8324 million at december 31 2012 which was 1125 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2012 pbo was computed based on a weighted average discount rate of 40 which was based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 575 million higher or 518 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussed 

the weighted average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2012 was 46 if the discount rate used to compute 2012 pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 38 million higher or 29 million lower respectively than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 57 weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets used to calculate pension expense in 2012 is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2012 would have been 30 million lower or higher respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our pension plans 

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest as well as variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary our judgment in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our level of involvement in setting up the entity determining whether the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on our behalf determining whether we provide more than half the subordinated financial support to the entity and determining whether we direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses or returns 

we use the equity method to account for investments in affiliates that we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies plus the amortization expense of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of purchase accounting our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions we regularly review our variable interest entities for potential changes in consolidation status 

we eliminate from our consolidated financial results all significant intercompany transactions

discussion of seasonality impacts on operations 

our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices the valuation of our investments interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to fertilizer sales are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea and uan 32 by approximately 33 22 and 14 respectively 

natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments covering periods of generally less than 18 months the derivative instruments that we use currently are natural gas swaps and options these derivatives settle using nymex futures price indexes which represent the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods 

at december 31 2012 we had open derivative contracts for 589 million mmbtus of natural gas consisting primarily of options a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas at december 31 2012 would favorably change the fair value of these derivative positions by 280 million and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would unfavorably change their fair value by 103 million at december 31 2011 we had open derivative contracts for 1563 million mmbtus of natural gas consisting primarily of swaps 

we purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of dap and map there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered through increases in selling prices we enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices a 10 per ton change in the related cost of a short ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change dap production cost by 210 per ton and 380 per ton respectively we 

cf industries holdings inc 

also may from time to time purchase ammonia granular urea uan dap and map to augment or replace production at our facilities 

interest rate fluctuations 

as of september 30 2012 we had two series of senior notes each with 8000 million outstanding and original maturity dates of may 1 2018 and may 1 2020 the senior notes have fixed interest rates the fair value of our senior notes outstanding at december 31 2012 was approximately 20 billion borrowings under our 2012 credit agreement bear a current market rate of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings however in 2012 there were no borrowings under that agreement 

foreign currency exchange rates 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we entered into eurous dollar derivative hedging transactions related to the euro denominated construction costs associated with our recently announced capacity expansion projects at our donaldsonville and port neal facilities at december 31 2012 the notional amount of our open foreign currency forward contracts was approximately 8840 million and the fair value was 153 million a 10 change in usdeuro forward exchange rates would change the fair value of these positions by 884 million 

we are also directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the swiss franc we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies and prior to the fourth quarter of 2012 we did not utilize any foreign currency derivatives

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

we operated as a traditional supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries inc now our whollyowned subsidiary were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock 

in april 2010 we acquired terra industries inc terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock terras financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results and in the nitrogen segment results since the acquisition date of april 5 2010 as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities our 753 interest in tnclp and certain joint venture interests 

cf industries holdings inc 

operating segments 

our business is divided into two operating segments the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment the nitrogen segment includes the manufacture and sale of ammonia urea uan and an the phosphate segment includes the manufacture and sale of dap and map 

nitrogen segment 

we are the largest nitrogen fertilizer producer in north america our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia urea uan and an our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the following table the sales shown do not reflect amounts used internally such as ammonia in the manufacture of other products 



1 other nitrogen segment products include aqua ammonia nitric acid urea liquor and def 

gross margin for the nitrogen segment was 25632 million 10267 million and 7842 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively total assets for the nitrogen segment were 60 billion and 61 billion as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we operate seven nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in north america we are 100 owners of these production facilities four in the central united states and one in ontario canada we also have a 753 interest in tnclp and its subsidiary tnlp which owns a nitrogen fertilizer facility in verdigris oklahoma and a 66 economic interest in cfl a variable interest entity that owns the nitrogen fertilizer complex in medicine hat alberta canada in 2011 the combined production capacity of these seven facilities represented approximately 39 of north american ammonia capacity 35 of north american dry urea capacity 47 of north american uan capacity and 22 of north american ammonium nitrate products capacity each of our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in north america has onsite storage to provide flexibility to manage the flow of outbound shipments without impacting production 

our joint venture interests in plnl and growhow provide additional production capacity in three additional nitrogen fertilizer production facilities one located in the republic of trinidad and tobago and two located in the united kingdom 

cf industries holdings inc 

the following table shows the production capacities at each of our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in 2011 natural gas accounted for approximately 45 of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities access abundant competitivelypriced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities we have facilities 

cf industries holdings inc 

located at or near henry hub in louisiana oneok in oklahoma aeco in alberta ventura in iowa and dawn in ontario 

our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consume in the aggregate in excess of 250 million mmbtus of natural gas annually we employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced supply of natural gas we also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices for further information about our natural gas hedging activities see note 28—derivative financial instruments 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the safe efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer to terminals warehouses and customers each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on production capability and location 

our north american production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the us and canada with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5100 tank and hopper cars as well as railcars provided by rail carriers 

the north american waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our donaldsonville verdigris and yazoo city facilities we employ a fleet of ten leased tow boats and 32 river barges to ship ammonia and uan we also utilize contract marine services to move urea and phosphate fertilizers 

three of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia the donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2000mile long nustar pipeline through which we transport ammonia to over 20 terminals and shipping points located in the midwestern us corn belt our verdigris and port neal facilities are connected to the 1100mile long magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the us midwest 

phosphate segment 

we are a major manufacturer of phosphate fertilizer products our main phosphate fertilizer products are dap and map we also sold potash fertilizer in 2009 but have ceased sales of this product potash results are included in the phosphate segment 

our historical sales of phosphate fertilizer products are shown in the table below 



cf industries holdings inc 

gross margin for the phosphate segment was 3324 million 1528 million and 552 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively total assets for the phosphate segment were 6964 million and 6183 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

our phosphate fertilizer manufacturing operations are located in central florida and consist of a phosphate fertilizer chemical complex in plant city a phosphate rock mine a beneficiation plant and phosphate rock reserves in hardee county and a deepwater terminal facility in the port of tampa we own each of these facilities and properties 

the following table summarizes our phosphate fertilizer production volumes for the last three years and current production capacities for phosphaterelated products 



1 p 2 o 5 is the basic measure of the nutrient content in phosphate fertilizer products 2 capacities shown for phosphate rock at the hardee county phosphate rock mine and dapmap granulation at the plant city facility are constrained by plant citys capacity to produce phosphoric acid 

hardee county phosphate rock mine 

in 1975 we purchased 20000 acres of land in hardee county florida that was originally estimated to contain in excess of 100 million tons of recoverable rock reserves between 1978 and 1993 we operated a one million ton per year phosphate rock mine on a 5000acre portion of these reserves in 1995 we began operations at an expanded mine on the remaining 15000acre area of the reserve property since that time we have acquired additional rock reserves through acquisitions or exchanges of several smaller parcels of land 

the table below shows the estimated reserves at the hardee phosphate complex as of december 31 2011 also reflected in the table is the grade of the reserves expressed as a percentage of bone phosphate of lime bpl and p 2 o 5  the table also reflects the average values of the following material contaminants contained in the reserves ferrous oxide fe 2 o 3  plus aluminum oxide al 2 o 3  and magnesium oxide mgo 

cf industries holdings inc 

proven and probable reserves 1 hardee phosphate complex as of december 31 2011 



1 the minimum drill hole density for the proven reserves classification is 1 hole per 20 acres 2 the reserve estimates provided have been developed by the company in accordance with industry guide 7 promulgated by the sec we estimate that 99 of the reserves are proven 

our phosphate reserve estimates are based on geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff geologist as of december 31 2011 reserve estimates are updated periodically to reflect actual phosphate rock recovered new drilling information and other geological or mining data estimates for 99 of the reserves are based on 20acre density drilling 

plant city phosphate complex 

our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in north america at one million tons per year its phosphoric acid capacity represents approximately 10 of the total us capacity all of plant citys phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates dap and map representing approximately 14 of us capacity for ammonium phosphate fertilizer products in 2011 the combination of the plant city phosphate fertilizer complex and the hardee mine gives us one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in north america 

bartow phosphate complex 

we own a former phosphate manufacturing complex in bartow florida that ceased production in 1999 the former manufacturing facilities have since been dismantled and disposed of in accordance with local laws and regulations the phosphogypsum stack has been closed and the former storage and distribution facilities were sold along with excess land we continue to be obligated for the closure of the cooling pond management of water treatment on the site and providing longterm care for the site in accordance with regulatory requirements 

phosphate raw materials 

phosphate rock supply phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers approximately 35 tons of phosphate rock are needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5 the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex typically consumes in excess of three million tons of rock annually as of december 31 2011 our hardee rock mine had approximately 13 years of fully permitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our hardee property where we can mine the expanded area has an estimated 34 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves we estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area 

cf industries holdings inc 

sulfur supply sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid approximately three quarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5  our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 800000 long tons of sulfur annually when operating at capacity we obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration in 2011 martin sulphur our largest molten sulfur supplier supplied approximately 60 of the molten sulfur used at plant city 

ammonia supply dap and map have a nitrogen content of 18 and 11 respectively and a phosphate nutrient content of 46 and 52 respectively ammonia is the primary source of nitrogen in dap and map operating at capacity our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex consumes approximately 400000 tons of ammonia annually 

the ammonia used at our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia storage facility located in tampa florida this facility consists of a 38000ton ammonia storage tank access to a deepwater dock that is capable of discharging oceangoing vessels and rail and truck loading facilities in addition to supplying our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex our tampa ammonia distribution system has the capacity to support ammonia sales to and distribution services for other customers sales of ammonia from our tampa terminal are reported in our nitrogen business segment the ammonia supply for tampa is purchased from offshore sources providing us with access to the broad international ammonia market 

phosphate distribution 

we operate a phosphate fertilizer warehouse located at a deepwater port facility in tampa florida most of the phosphate fertilizer produced at plant city is shipped by truck or rail to our tampa warehouse where it is loaded onto vessels for shipment to export customers or for transport across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river in 2011 our tampa warehouse handled approximately 13 million tons of phosphate fertilizers or about 66 of our production the remainder of our phosphate fertilizer production is transported by truck or rail directly to customers or to inmarket storage facilities 

phosphate fertilizer shipped across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river is transferred into river barges near new orleans phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is transported to our storage facilities or delivered directly to customers river transportation is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators 

cf industries holdings inc 

storage facilities and other properties 

at december 31 2011 we owned or leased space at 75 inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 20state region including storage at our production facilities and at the tampa warehouse and ammonia terminal we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately three million tons of fertilizer our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table 



1 capacity is expressed as the equivalent volume of uan measured on a 32 nitrogen content basis 2 our dry products include urea dap and map 3 our lease agreements are typically for periods of one to three years 

customers 

the principal customers for our nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force 

the following table sets forth the sales to our major customers for the past three years 



1 we own 50 of the common stock of keytrade keytrade purchases fertilizer products from various manufacturers around the world and resells them in approximately 90 countries through a network of nine offices we utilize keytrade as our exclusive exporter of phosphate fertilizers from north america and importer of uan products into north america profits resulting from sales or purchases with keytrade are eliminated until realized by keytrade or us respectively see note 19—equity method investments 

cf industries holdings inc 

chs inc chs growmark inc growmark and gavilon fertilizer llc are significant customers of both the nitrogen and phosphate segments a loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and the individual results of each segment 

competition 

our markets are intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

in our nitrogen segment our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium and koch nitrogen fertilizers there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition from foreignsourced products continuously 

in our phosphate segment our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium mosaic potash corp and simplot the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer andor trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations 

seasonality 

the sales patterns of all six of our major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

financial information about foreign and domestic sales and operations 

the amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying value of our foreign and domestic assets are set forth in note 33—segment disclosures 

environment health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes violations can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without 

cf industries holdings inc 

regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment 

environmental health and safety expenditures 

our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2011 totaled approximately 132 million in 2012 we estimate that we will spend approximately 795 million for environmental health and safety capital expenditures the increase in expenditures in 2012 is primarily related to certain projects to reduce emissions from our facilities including projects related to the consent decrees that the company has entered into and to improve the storage tank integrity and capacity at certain plant locations environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

on august 18 2009 the epa entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court judge on november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious the court ordered the epa to issue proposed or final numeric nutrient criteria for streams by may 21 2012 subject to the epa seeking an extension of such time period pursuant to the terms of the 2009 consent decree depending on the developments discussed herein federal or state numeric water quality criteria for lakes and inland flowing waters could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining manufacturing and distribution operations in florida 

the federal criteria for lakes and inland flowing waters excluding the criteria found arbitrary and capricious by the court will become effective in march 2012 subject to i the epas proposed delay in the effective date of the regulation which may require the approval of the court and ii the development of numeric nutrient criteria by the state of florida 

prior to the february 18 2012 order the epa had proposed to stay the effective date of its criteria until june 4 2012 due to the development of numeric nutrient criteria proposed by the state of florida in december 2011 however the courts order stated that the court must approve an extension of the effective date of the federal rule pursuant to the terms of the consent decree the nitrogen and phosphorous criteria in the december 2011 rule proposed by the state of florida are substantially identical to the federal rule but the state proposal includes biological verification as a component of the criteria and adopts existing nutrient total maximum daily loads tmdl as applicable numeric criteria the impact of these modifications could be to provide more flexibility with respect to nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits so long as such discharges do not impair the biological health of receiving water bodies environmental groups have filed a 

cf industries holdings inc 

challenge to the proposed state rule with the florida division of administrative hearings which will be reviewed by an administrative law judge in early 2012 if the state numeric criteria are promulgated and approved subsequently by the epa the state criteria would result in epa withdrawing the federal numeric criteria 

the 2009 consent decree also requires the epa to develop numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the development of such criteria has been delayed the epa has announced its intention to issue proposed numeric nutrient criteria for these water bodies by march 2012 and a final rule by november 2012 it is unclear the extent to which the february 18 2012 decision will impact this proposed rule the numeric criteria proposed by the state of florida discussed above include criteria for coastal and estuarine waters and if finally promulgated by the state and approved by the epa would also supplant federal standards for such water bodies 

the numeric nutrient criteria regulation is not yet final however more stringent limits on wastewater discharge permits could increase our costs or limit our operations and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulation of greenhouse gasses 

we are subject to regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states concerning climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions 

the united kingdom is a party to the kyoto protocol as a result of agreements reached during a conference in durban south africa the kyoto protocol will continue in force for a second commitment period which will expire by 2020 to be replaced by another international agreement to be negotiated by 2015 which agreement is to go into effect in 2020 the united kingdom has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas trading system our joint venture uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require the joint venture to purchase co 2 emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our joint venture uk sites are also subject to the european union emissions trading scheme more stringent ghg emission limits in the uk and europe are expected to go into effect beginning in 2013 

in canada which in december 2011 withdrew from further participation in the kyoto protocol but signed the durban platform to negotiate a new international greenhouse gas agreement or protocol by 2015 we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canadas national pollutant release inventory and ontarios mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation ontario is also a party to the western climate initiative comprised of california the other states in the initiative having withdrawn and several canadian provinces which intends to establish a cap and trade regime for the trading of ghg credits within the regional area ostensibly to begin in 2013 with 2012 functioning as a transition year although ontario has not disavowed its participation in the initiative it has not developed regulations to establish a cap and trade program 

in the united states not a party to the kyoto protocol but a signatory to the durban platform with respect to the negotiation of a replacement for the kyoto protocol ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels although there were federal legislative developments in the 111 th congress including the passage of a comprehensive climate change bill in the house of representatives efforts to pass such legislation have ceased however the epa issued federal ghg regulations that impact our facilities including a mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in may 2010 the epa issued the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v greenhouse gas 

cf industries holdings inc 

tailoring rule tailoring rule this regulation establishes that the construction of new or modification of existing major sources of ghg emissions would become subject to the psd air permitting program and later the title v permitting program beginning in january 2011 although the regulation also significantly increases the emissions thresholds that would subject facilities to these regulations this regulation along with other ghg regulations and determinations issued by the epa is currently subject to judicial appeal regulation of ghg emissions pursuant to the psd program could subject new capital projects to additional permitting requirements that may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects 

under the title v provisions of the tailoring rule all of our us manufacturing facilities will be required to include ghg emissions in future air emissions inventory reports other than the states implementation of the tailoring rule none of the states where our us production facilities are located—florida louisiana mississippi iowa and oklahoma—has proposed regulations limiting ghg emissions iowa is a member of the midwest greenhouse gas reduction accord signed in 2007 but the member states appear to have discontinued any action to implement the accord 

proposed revisions to new source performance standards for nitric acid plants 

in october 2011 the epa issued a proposed regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants we operate 13 nitric acid plants in the united states the regulations when finalized will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the proposed regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the proposed limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides no x  notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the proposed regulation if finalized as is could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants although the proposed epa regulation did not include a proposed limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas comments have been submitted urging epa to include such limits in the final regulation the final regulation is expected to be issued in 2012 

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and mining permits authorizing operations at our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals 

as of december 31 2011 the area permitted for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 459 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which we expect to meet our requirements at current production rates for approximately 13 years we have secured the necessary permits to mine these reserves from the fdep and the us army corps of engineers we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated additional 34 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which we expect will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area the estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective of the anticipated permittable mining areas based on recent similar permitting efforts in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

cf industries holdings inc 

we have secured the state environmental authorization to increase the capacity of our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city with the completion of our current expansion project this stack has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits including additional expansion phases the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this date is approximately six years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in certain cases as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities we currently utilize a trust established for the benefit of the epa and the fdep and an escrow account established for the benefit of the fdep as a means of complying with financial assurance requirements for the closure and longterm care of our phosphogypsum stack systems for additional information on the cash deposit arrangements see note 12—asset retirement obligations 

several of our permits including our mining permit at the hardee phosphate complex require us to reclaim any property disturbed by our operations at our hardee property we currently mine approximately 300 to 500 acres of land each year all of which must be reclaimed the costs to reclaim this land vary based on the type of land involved and range from 3700 to 18200 an acre with an average of 9600 an acre for additional information on our hardee asset retirement obligations see note 12—asset retirement obligations 

our phosphate operations in florida are subject to regulations governing the closure and longterm maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at our bartow phosphate complex we estimate that we will spend a total of approximately 3 million between 2012 and 2016 to complete closure of the cooling pond and channels water treating expenditures at bartow are estimated to require about 12 million over the next 45 years postclosure longterm care expenditures at bartow are estimated to total approximately 51 million for a 51 year period including 2012 to close the phosphogypsum stack currently in use at the plant city phosphate complex we estimate that we will spend approximately 65 million during the years 2033 through 2037 and another 45 million in 2087 to close the cooling pond water treating expenditures at plant city are estimated to approximate 6 million in 2018 64 million in 2033 through 2037 and 166 million thereafter through 2087 postclosure longterm care expenditures at plant city are estimated to total 106 million for a 50 year period commencing in 2038 these amounts are in nominal dollars using an assumed inflation rate of 3 

cost estimates for closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems are based on formal closure plans submitted to the state of florida which are subject to revision during negotiations over the next several years moreover the time frame involved in the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems extends as far as the year 2087 accordingly the actual amount to be spent also will depend upon factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation and changes in applicable laws and regulations these cost estimates may also increase if the plant city phosphogypsum stack is expanded further for additional information on asset retirement obligations related to our phosphogypsum systems see note 12—asset retirement obligations

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is dependent on north american natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our nitrogen fertilizers 

the price of natural gas in north america has been highly volatile in recent years during 2011 the average daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america reached a high of 492 per mmbtu on june 9 2011 and a low of 283 per mmbtu on november 23 2011 

changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can also lead to periods of high natural gas prices if this were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the price we pay for natural gas in the future may be higher than prices paid by producers in certain other fertilizerproducing regions of the world which may make it more difficult for us to compete against these producers 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our results of operations tend to be negatively impacted 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by population growth changes in dietary habits nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels and planted acreage and application rates among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade 

periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacity 

during periods of industry oversupply our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and 

cf industries holdings inc 

product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities 

some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships 

china the worlds largest producer and consumer of fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability if chinese policy encourages exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we may face increased competition from russian and ukrainian urea and ammonium nitrate urea imports from russia and ukraine are currently subject to antidumping orders that impose duties ranging from approximately one percent to 68 percent on urea imported into the united states from these two countries russia and ukraine currently have considerable capacity to produce urea and are the worlds largest urea exporters in russia the price for natural gas used for industrial production continues to be set by the government and is below its market value russian nitrogen fertilizer producers benefit from these governmentcontrolled prices encouraging inefficient urea production and high volumes of exports in ukraine the government intervenes with respect to natural gas prices available to fertilizer producers so as to permit continued exports the antidumping orders have been in place since 1987 and there has been very little urea imported into the united states from russia or ukraine since that time the us department of commerce regularly reviews the us sales of urea made by russian exporters in october 2011 the us department of commerce completed its most recent review of us sales made by the russian exporter eurochem and concluded that duties of approximately one percent should be imposed this low rate of duty may result in increased imports of lowpriced russian urea into the united states 

in 2011 the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission conducted the third sunset review of the urea antidumping orders to determine whether they should be kept in place for an additional five years the review has resulted in a decision to leave the orders in place for another five years and the next sunset review is not expected to be initiated until late 2016 

russia is by far the worlds largest ammonium nitrate producer and exporter as in the case of urea russian ammonium nitrate producers benefit from belowmarket pricing of natural gas fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia is subject to an antidumping duty order which currently imposes antidumping duties of 25398 percent on russian ammonium nitrate imports into the united states in may 2011 this order replaced a longstanding suspension agreement which had imposed volume and pricing restrictions on russian ammonium nitrate imports in 2011 the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission completed the second sunset review of the russian ammonium nitrate antidumping order and concluded that it will remain in effect for at least another five years fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from ukraine is also subject to an antidumping duty order under which imports of this product are currently subject to a duty of over 156 percent that order is expected to be reviewed beginning in june 2012

a decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products 

conditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control 

state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications in recent years for example ethanol production in the united states has increased significantly due in part to federal legislation mandating greater use of renewable fuels this increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuels standard or rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to reduce subsidies for ethanol allow increased ethanol imports and adopt temporary waivers of the current rfs levels any of which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment 

our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations 

we rely on railroad trucking pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of our raw materials or finished products 

if our shipping is delayed or if we are unable to ship our finished products or obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our sales revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard or tih materials such as the anhydrous ammonia 

cf industries holdings inc 

we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities these efforts by the railroads include i requesting that the surface transportation board or stb issue a policy statement finding that it is reasonable for a railroad to require a shipper to indemnify the railroads and carry insurance for all liability above a certain amount arising from the transportation of tih materials ii requesting that the stb approve an increase in the maximum reasonable rates that a railroad can charge for the transportation of tih materials and iii lobbying for new legislation or regulations that would limit or eliminate the railroads common carrier obligation to transport tih materials if the railroads were to succeed in one or more of these initiatives it could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads 

new regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products the federal railroad administration is developing higher ammonia tank car performance standards which could require the modification or replacement of our leased tank car fleet the effective date of these new regulations is not known at this time however the federal railroad administration has approved an interim car design for a 20 year period in 2010 we contracted to switch a significant portion of our leased fleet over the next 5 years to this interim car standards higher than those of the interim cars could adversely impact our cost of operations and our ability to obtain an adequate supply of rail cars to support our operations 

integrating the information management systems of cf industries and terra is continuing integration difficulties or cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results 

cf industries continues to utilize legacy terras separate information management systems to process transactions governing core business operations of the legacy terra plants to fully integrate the terra operations into cf industries business processes and to achieve additional benefits of the acquisition cf industries is undertaking a project to consolidate all business processes for the combined companies under a new single enterprise resource planning erp system utilizing software provided by sap this multiyear companywide program will align business processes and procedures institute more efficient transaction processing and improve access to and consistency of information to enable standardization of business activities we expect to implement this system in 2012 the implementation of an erp system across the combined organization entails certain risks if we do not implement the system successfully and within the planned budget or if the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner it could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

as we continue to increase our dependence on digital technologies to conduct our operations the risks associated with cyber security also increase we rely on management information systems among other things to manage our accounting manufacturing supply chain and financial functions this risk not only applies to us but also to third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our information from being vulnerable to theft loss damage or interruption from a number of potential sources or events we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks compromises to information system could have severe financial and other business implications 

cf industries holdings inc 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products and increase the cost of natural gas 

weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas our principal raw material used to make nitrogen based fertilizers colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand of natural gas for residential and industrial use in addition hurricanes affecting the gulf coastal states can severely impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise sharply 

expansion of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both domestically and in foreign locations major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments require significant managerial resources which may be diverted from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other investments 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act rcra the comprehensive environmental response cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes 

as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be 

cf industries holdings inc 

material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations additionally future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures additionally our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

from time to time our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our carrier refuses coverage for these losses 

on august 18 2009 the epa entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court judge on november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious the court ordered the epa to issue proposed or final numeric nutrient criteria for streams by may 21 2012 subject to the epa seeking an extension of such time period pursuant to the terms of the 2009 consent decree depending on the developments discussed herein federal or state numeric water quality criteria for lakes and inland flowing waters could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining manufacturing and distribution operations in florida 

the federal criteria for lakes and inland flowing waters excluding the criteria found arbitrary and capricious by the court will become effective in march 2012 subject to i the epas proposed delay in the effective date of the regulation which may require the approval of the court and ii the development of numeric nutrient criteria by the state of florida 

prior to the february 18 2012 order the epa had proposed to stay the effective date of its criteria until june 4 2012 due to the development of numeric nutrient criteria proposed by the state of florida in december 2011 however the courts order stated that the court must approve an extension of the effective date of the federal rule pursuant to the terms of the consent decree the nitrogen and phosphorous criteria in the december 2011 rule proposed by the state of florida are substantially identical to the federal rule but the state proposal includes biological verification as a component of the criteria and adopts existing nutrient total maximum daily loads tmdl as applicable numeric criteria the impact of these modifications could be to provide more flexibility with respect to nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits so long as such discharges do not impair the biological health of receiving water bodies environmental groups have filed a challenge to the proposed state rule with the florida division of administrative hearings which will be reviewed by an administrative law judge in early 2012 if the state numeric criteria are promulgated and approved subsequently by the epa the state criteria would result in epa withdrawing the federal numeric criteria

the 2009 consent decree also requires the epa to develop numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the development of such criteria has been delayed the epa has announced its intention to issue proposed numeric nutrient criteria for these water bodies by march 2012 and a final rule by november 2012 it is unclear the extent to which the february 18 2012 decision will impact this proposed rule the numeric criteria proposed by the state of florida discussed above include criteria for coastal and estuarine waters and if finally promulgated by the state and approved by the epa would also supplant federal standards for such water bodies 

the numeric nutrient criteria regulation is not yet final however more stringent limits on wastewater discharge permits could increase our costs or limit our operations and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are dependent on numerous required permits approvals and meeting financial assurance requirements from governmental authorities 

we hold numerous environmental mining and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion of our operations is dependent upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in certain cases as a condition to procure such permits and approvals or as a condition to maintain existing approvals we may be required to comply with regulatory financial assurance requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure local state or federal government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care and reclamation at our facilities for example in 2006 we established an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection fdep as a means of complying with floridas regulations governing financial assurance related to closure and postclosure of phosphogypsum stacks also in 2010 pursuant to a consent decree with the us epa and the fdep we funded a trust as a means of complying with similar requirements for closure post closure and monitoring of the phosphogypsum stack system at our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex 

florida regulations also mandate payment of certain mining taxes based on the quantity of ore mined and are subject to change based on local regulatory approvals additional financial assurance requirements or other increases in local mining regulations and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

florida regulations also require phosphate rock mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities the demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds letters of credit insurance policies or similar instruments it is possible that we will not be able to comply with either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

cf industries holdings inc 

as of december 31 2011 the area permitted by local state and federal authorities for mining at our hardee phosphate complex contained approximately 459 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current operating rates for approximately 13 years we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated 34 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue or expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have secured the state environmental authorization to increase the capacity of our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city with the completion of our phase ii expansion that is currently being constructed this stack has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits including further expansion phases the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately six years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to climate change regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of future climate change regulations more stringent greenhouse gas ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have significant impacts on the fertilizer industry due to the fact that our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our operating results in addition to the extent that climate change restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than in the united states or canada our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us 

our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of 

cf industries holdings inc 

fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season 

if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are particularly acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the volatility of nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns causing an adverse change in operating results 

a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis including under our forward pricing program fpp at prices and delivery dates we propose this improves our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allows us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing assets 

under our fpp customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and generally pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date thereby significantly increasing our liquidity any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months or more as of december 31 2011 and 2010 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders equaled approximately 21 and 54 respectively of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

we believe the ability to purchase product on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

we also sell phosphate products on a forward basis including under the fpp in 2011 forward sales of phosphate fertilizer products represented approximately 50 of our phosphate fertilizer volume unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products where we have the opportunity to fix the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate fertilizer costs as a result we are typically exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses 

we manage commodity price risk for our business although we have risk measurement systems that use various methodologies to quantify the risk these systems might not always be followed or might not always work as planned further such risk measurement systems do not in themselves manage risk even if risks have been identified our earnings cash flows and balance sheet could be adversely affected by changes involving volatility changes involving adverse correlation of commodity prices or market liquidity issues our ability to manage exposure to commodity price risk through the use of financial derivatives also may be affected by limitations imposed by the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness 

in order to manage financial exposure to commodity price and market fluctuations we utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen based fertilizers in these hedging activities we have used fixedprice forward physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter or otc markets or on exchanges nevertheless no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract or industry therefore unhedged risks will always continue to exist 

our use of derivatives to lock in the natural gas portion of our margins on forward sales of nitrogen products can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives prior to the purchase of the natural gas 

our natural gas acquisition policy also allows us to establish derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our forward sales holding such positions during periods of declining natural gas prices could expose us to cash collateral deposit requirements with counterparties thereby negatively impacting our liquidity 

in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions we monitor the swap portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties established credit limits cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on derivative settlements 

our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 

cf industries holdings inc 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage 

we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities 

our nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in seven separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represents approximately 40 of the companys ammonia production capacity our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on our phosphate mine and associated beneficiation plant in hardee county florida our phosphate fertilizer complex in plant city florida and our ammonia terminal in tampa florida the suspension of operations at any of these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments under our fpp and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a number of our key facilities including the donaldsonville complex and all of our phosphate operations are located in regions of the united states that experience a relatively high level of hurricane activity such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas and sulfur in the gulf of mexico region 

we are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventures 

we participate in joint ventures including cfl which owns our facility in medicine hat alberta point lisas which owns our facility in trinidad growhow which owns our facilities in billingham and ince united kingdom and keytrade our joint venture partners may share or have majority control over the operations of our joint ventures as a result our investments in joint ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our joint ventures or our partners have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions requests policies or objectives subject the joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business 

in addition we may become involved in disputes with our joint venture partners which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities our plants and ancillary facilities may be targets of terrorist activities many of these plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other items that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

cf industries holdings inc 

in addition due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives local state federal and foreign governments could implement new regulations impacting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives as was used in the oklahoma city bombing in april 1995 it is possible that the us or foreign governments could impose limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell that product 

our operations are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and an increase in the price or any delay or interruption in the delivery of these raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas ammonia and sulfur as raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase these raw materials from thirdparty suppliers prices for these raw materials can fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand we may not be able to pass along to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business these products are transported by barge truck rail or pipeline to our facilities by thirdparty transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw materials including those caused by capacity constraints explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving pipelines deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime or labor difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations 

our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions during 2011 we derived approximately 15 of our net sales from outside of the united states our business operations include a 50 interest in an ammonia production joint venture in trinidad and a 50 interest in a uk joint venture for the production of anhydrous ammonia and other fertilizer products 

our investments in securities are subject to risks that may result in losses 

our cash flows from operations have resulted in cash and cashequivalents of approximately 12 billion as of december 31 2011 we generally invest these cash and cashequivalents in what we believe to be relatively shortterm highly liquid and high credit quality instruments including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us government those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities our investments are subject to fluctuations in both market value and yield based upon changes in market conditions including interest rates liquidity general economic and credit market conditions and conditions specific to the issuers 

our efforts to manage investment risk could prove unsuccessful for example at december 31 2011 we held investments of 709 million in taxexempt auction rate securities these securities were 

cf industries holdings inc 

issued by various state and local government entities and are all supported by student loans that were issued primarily under the federal family loan program these auction rate securities have stated maturities that range up to 36 years and the underlying securities are guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities although redemptions have occurred sporadically currently there is no active market for these investments and we continue to hold them until liquidity resumes in the marketplace or we recover our investment by other means 

due to the risks of investments we may not achieve expected returns or may realize losses on our investments which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could impact the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories the overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted 

in addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizer significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact on the importation of fertilizers foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 

we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness or need to refinance existing indebtedness in the future which may adversely affect our operations 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 16 billion of total indebtedness consisting primarily of 800 million of our senior notes due in 2018 and 800 million of our senior notes due in 2020 we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing revolving credit facility of approximately 491 million the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future our existing indebtedness and any additional debt we may incur in the future could have important consequences on our business in adversely affecting our operations and liquidity in addition the terms of our revolving credit facility include covenants restricting our ability to engage in other business activities including among other things making investments making restricted payments and disposing of assets 

from time to time we consider our options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors consequently in the event we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time if at all if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us it could in addition to other negative effects have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

the loss of key members of our management and professional staff may adversely affect our business 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our senior management and professional staff the loss of one or more key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally if we are unable to find hire and retain needed key personnel in the future our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

clean air act investigation 

on march 19 2007 the company received a letter from the epa under section 114 of the federal clean air act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with new source review new source performance standards and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants at the plant city facility the company provided the requested information to the epa in late 2007 the epa initiated this same process in relation to numerous other sulfuric acid plants and phosphoric acid plants throughout the nation including other facilities in florida 

the company received a notice of violation nov from the epa by letter dated june 16 2010 the nov alleges the company violated the prevention of significant deterioration psd clean air act regulations relating to certain projects undertaken at the plant city facilitys sulfuric acid plants this nov further alleges that the actions that are the basis for the alleged psd violations also resulted in violations of title v air operating permit regulations finally the nov alleges that the company failed to comply with certain compliance dates established by hazardous air pollutant regulations for phosphoric acid manufacturing plants and phosphate fertilizer production plants the company had an initial meeting with the epa to discuss these alleged violations this matter has been referred to the united states department of justice doj the company does not know at this time if it will settle this matter prior to initiation of formal legal action 

we cannot estimate the potential penalties fines or other expenditures if any that may result from the clean air act nov and therefore we cannot determine if the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows 

epcracercla investigation 

pursuant to a letter from the doj dated july 28 2008 that was sent to representatives of the major us phosphoric acid manufacturers including cf industries the doj stated that it and the epa 

cf industries holdings inc 

believe that apparent violations of section 313 of the emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcra which requires annual reports to be submitted with respect to the use of certain toxic chemicals have occurred at all of the phosphoric acid facilities operated by these manufacturers the letter also states that the doj and the epa believe that most of these facilities have violated section 304 of epcra and section 103 of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla by failing to provide required notifications relating to the release of hydrogen fluoride from these facilities the letter did not specifically identify alleged violations at our plant city florida complex or assert a claim for a specific amount of penalties the epa submitted an information request to the company on february 11 2009 as a followup to the july 2008 letter the company provided information in response to the agencys inquiry on may 14 and may 29 2009

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

we operated as a traditional supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries inc now our whollyowned subsidiary were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock 

in april 2010 we acquired terra for a purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities our 753 interest in tnclp and certain joint venture interests

in 2011 average selling prices increased due primarily to higher demand for fertilizer for the following reasons higher planted acres in the spring season due to strong demand for corn and other grains which supported favorable farm economics global fertilizer supply constraints resulting from both export restrictions and production curtailments affecting certain foreign fertilizer producers and an expected high level of planted acres and fertilizer usage in the 2012 growing season higher average selling prices and sales volumes due to increased demand led to robust operating results in 2011 consolidated net sales in 2011 increased by 21 billion or 54 to 61 billion with increases due primarily to higher average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments and higher unit volume due primarily to the impact of the terra acquisition in 2011 average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices increased by 38 and 36 respectively gross margin increased by 17 billion or 146 to 29 billion in 2011 from 12 billion in 2010 the 2011 results include a 773 million 480 million after tax unrealized mark to market loss on natural gas derivatives results in 2011 also include 1455 million of net interest expense 902 million after tax a 348 million pretax 216 million after tax noncash impairment charge related to our woodward oklahoma methanol plant and a 325 million 200 million after tax gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses 

in april 2010 we completed the 46 billion acquisition of terra and it became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of cf holdings this acquisition made us a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer industry diversified our asset base and increased our geographic reach and operational efficiency as well as significantly increased our scale and capital market presence the financial results of the terra business are included in the consolidated results subsequent to the acquisition date consolidated net sales in 2010 were 40 billion up 52 as compared to 26 billion in 2009 due to the impact of the terra acquisition optimal weather conditions during both fertilizer application seasons and a favorable fertilizer environment due to strong farm economics while average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices 

cf industries holdings inc 

declined by 11 in 2010 average phosphate fertilizer prices increased by 28 gross margin increased by 3401 million or 41 in 2010 to 11795 million the 2010 results include a 96 million 59 million after tax unrealized mark to market gain on natural gas derivatives results in 2010 also include 2198 million of net interest expense 1361 million after tax 1504 million 1488 million after tax of business combination expenses and peru project costs a 283 million gain 175 million after tax on the sale of terra common stock acquired during 2009 and 216 million 134 million after tax of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of terra 

market conditions in 2009 were weak as lower demand for our products resulted from high industrywide inventories entering the year poor weather conditions and our customers hesitancy to restock due to an uncertain pricing environment pricing levels and raw material costs both declined in 2009 by late 2009 conditions had improved with expectations of a strong spring 2010 planting season and a tightening of the international supplydemand balance consolidated net sales in 2009 decreased by 13 billion or 33 to 26 billion with decreases due primarily to lower average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments this decrease was partially offset by potash sales and higher uan and phosphate export sales that we made in response to reduced domestic demand gross margin decreased by 3833 million to 8394 million in 2009 as the impact of lower average selling prices was partially mitigated by lower raw material costs and 875 million 540 million after tax of unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives results in 2009 include 534 million 449 million after tax of business combination expenses 359 million no tax impact of peru project costs and an 119 million gain 74 million after tax on the sale of terra common stock acquired during 2009 

key industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our agricultural products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply  demand 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key consumingexporting countries such as china india or brazil often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs availability of raw materials government policies and global trade 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea uan and an because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of 

cf industries holdings inc 

natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses expenditures on natural gas comprised approximately 45 of the total cost of sales for our nitrogen fertilizer in 2011 and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization 

farmers economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns and the types of crops planted 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters the development of natural gas reserves in north america over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the middle east the former soviet union the republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa and china are major exporters to north america 

the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer and trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations 

political and social government policies 

the political and social policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports the subsidization of natural gas the subsidization of domestic producers and the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives 

factors affecting our results 

net sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

cf industries holdings inc 

cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis including under our forward pricing program fpp at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost using natural gas derivative instruments we report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward sales later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment volatility in quarterly reported earnings may arise from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of derivatives 

selling general and administrative expenses our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees

selling prices increased to 385 per ton in 2011 from 278 per ton in 2010 with increases across all products strong demand for the spring application season due to an increase in planted acres depleted supplies available at both the producer and customer level due to strong demand global supply constraints and expectations that 2012 planted acres will remain at historically high levels resulted in higher average selling prices nitrogen fertilizer sales volume in 2011 increased 15 million tons from 2010 due primarily to higher uan and an sales volumes partially offset by lower ammonia sales volume uan sales volume increased significantly during 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to the acquisition of terra and the increased supply available from the woodward oklahoma uan plant expansion the increased uan production capacity allowed us to meet increased demand for uan resulting from favorable spring application conditions and customers replenishing depleted downstream inventories after the strong spring application season the increase in an sales in 2011 from the prior year is due to the inclusion of a full year of an sales in 2011 as the production capacity for this product was obtained in the terra acquisition the 2011 decrease in ammonia sales is due primarily to the additional ammonia required to support the production from the uan plant expansion at woodward 

cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged approximately 188 per ton in 2011 compared to 189 per ton in 2010 lower realized natural gas costs in 2011 were offset by unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives we recognized a 773 million unrealized marktomarket loss in 2011 compared to a net 96 million unrealized marktomarket gain in 2010

net sales nitrogen segment net sales increased 13 billion or 73 to 32 billion in 2010 compared to 18 billion in 2009 due primarily to the acquisition of terra and increased ammonia sales volume which was partially offset by lower average selling prices across nitrogen products nitrogen fertilizer sales volume in 2010 increased 56 million tons from 2009 due primarily to the acquisition of terra ammonia sales volume increased significantly during 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to the terra acquisition plus strong spring and fall application seasons due to favorable weather conditions and increased fourth quarter demand due to expectations of strong planted acres in 2011 urea and uan sales volume increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 due primarily to the acquisition of terra during 2009 we benefited from substantial forward sales volume that had been contracted at earlier dates and higher prices 

cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged approximately 189 per ton in 2010 compared to 180 per ton in 2009 the 5 increase was due primarily to lower unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in 2010 compared to the prior year period higher depreciation and amortization expense due to the terra acquisition and a greater percentage of sales volume in the form of ammonia partially offset by lower realized natural gas costs we recognized a 96 million unrealized marktomarket gain in 2010 compared to a net 875 million unrealized marktomarket gain in 2009

liquidity and capital resources 

generally our primary source of cash is cash from operations which includes customer advances our primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements investments and dividends our working capital requirements are affected by several factors including demand for our products selling prices for our products raw material costs freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business 

under our shortterm investment policy we may invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us and canadian governments those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities 

cash balances 

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents of 12 billion and 7977 million respectively we also had shortterm investments of 31 million as of december 31 2010 as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had a current liability attributable to customer advances of 2572 million and 4315 million respectively associated with forward sales commitments 

share repurchase program 

on august 4 2011 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase our common stock for a total expenditure of up to 15 billion plus program expenses repurchases under this program were authorized to be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise through december 31 2013 we repurchased approximately 65 million shares under this program at an aggregate cost of 10 billion 

investments in auction rate securities 

as of december 31 2011 our investments in auction rate securities were reported at their fair value of 709 million after reflecting a 47 million unrealized holding loss against a par value of 

cf industries holdings inc 

756 million at december 31 2010 our investments in auction rate securities totaled 1028 million after reflecting a 76 million unrealized holding loss against a par value of 1104 million 

because the traditional auction process for auction rate securities generally has failed since early 2008 we do not consider our auction rate securities to be liquid investments we are not able to access these funds until such time as auctions for the securities succeed once again buyers are found outside the auction process or the securities are redeemed by the issuers during 2011 348 million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par value in accordance with our policies we review the underlying securities and assess the creditworthiness of these securities as part of our investment process 

we determined the fair value of these investments at december 31 2011 using a marktomodel approach that relies on discounted cash flows market data and inputs derived from similar instruments the unrealized holding loss has been reported in other comprehensive income as the impairment is deemed to be temporary based on the requirements set forth in asc topic 320— investments—debt and equity securities  see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our investments in auction rate securities 

the model we use to value our auction rate securities uses discounted cash flow calculations as one of the significant inputs to the ultimate determination of fair value the base interest rates assumed for the required rates of return are key components of the calculation of discounted cash flows if the required rate of return we used in the calculation model was 100 basis points higher the resulting holding loss would have been approximately 42 million greater we may need to recognize either additional holding gains or losses in other comprehensive income or holding losses in net earnings should changes occur in either the conditions in the credit markets the credit worthiness of the issuers or in the variables considered in our valuation model 

we believe ultimately we will recover the historical cost for these instruments as we presently intend to hold these securities until market liquidity returns either through resumption of auctions or otherwise we do not believe the ongoing market liquidity issues regarding these securities present any operating liquidity issues for us we believe our cash cash equivalents operating cash flow and credit available under our credit facility are adequate to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 

debt 

as of december 31 2011 we had 16 billion of outstanding senior notes and 130 million of terra 7 senior notes due 2017 2017 notes as of december 31 2010 we had 3460 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured term loan facility term loan facility 16 billion of outstanding senior notes and 130 million of 2017 notes during the first quarter of 2011 we repaid the remaining 3460 million outstanding under the term loan facility using cash generated from operations our senior notes were issued in two series of 800 million each the first series carries an interest rate of 6875 and is due in the aggregate in 2018 the second series carries an interest rate of 7125 and is due in the aggregate in 2020 

notes payable representing amounts owed by cfl to its noncontrolling interest holder with respect to advances were 48 million as of december 31 2011 compared to 49 million as of december 31 2010 during 2011 the notes payable outstanding at december 31 2010 were cancelled and reissued with a maturity date of december 31 2013 

we have a senior secured revolving credit facility which provides for 500 million of borrowings outstanding at any time for working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 4912 million and 4829 million respectively was 

cf industries holdings inc 

available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility reflecting 88 million and 171 million respectively of outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings thereunder 

the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility includes representations and warranties covenants and events of default including requirements that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio as well as other customary covenants our senior notes indentures also include certain covenants and events of default as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement and the senior notes indentures

acquisition of terra industries inc 

in april of 2010 we completed the acquisition of terra through the merger of composite merger corporation our indirect whollyowned subsidiary composite with and into terra pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of march 12 2010 among cf holdings composite and terra the merger agreement as a result of the merger terra became an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of the cf holdings the acquisition of terra has made us a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer industry diversified our asset base and increased our geographic reach and operational efficiency and significantly increased our scale and capital market presence 

pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement each outstanding share of terra common stock was converted into the right to receive 3715 in cash and 00953 of a share of cf holdings common stock pursuant to an exchange offer and secondstep merger the merger cf holdings issued an aggregate of 95 million shares of its common stock with a fair value of 8820 million and paid an aggregate of 32 billion in cash net of 05 billion cash acquired for 100 of terras common stock 

we funded the cash requirements of the acquisition with cash on hand 175 billion of borrowings under a senior secured bridge facility and approximately 19 billion of borrowings under a senior secured term loan facility that provided for up to 20 billion of borrowings on april 21 2010 cf holdings completed a public offering of approximately 129 million shares of common stock at 8900 per share the proceeds of 11 billion net of underwriting discounts and customary fees were used to repay a portion of the senior secured bridge facility on april 23 2010 cf industries completed a public offering of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of 16 billion approximately 6452 million of the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay in full the remaining outstanding borrowings under the senior secured bridge facility we used the remaining proceeds from the offering to repay approximately 8642 million of the senior secured term loan facility in may 2010 we redeemed terras 775 senior notes due 2019 for 7445 million and recognized a 170 million loss on the early extinguishment of that debt see note 25—financing agreements for further information regarding these financing arrangements 

capital spending 

capital expenditures of 2472 million in 2011 were made to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements the 109 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2011 as compared to 2010 is due primarily to the absence of spending in 2011 on the woodward oklahoma uan plant expansion offset partially by an increase in routine capital projects we expect to spend approximately 4000 million on capital expenditures in 2012 the anticipated increase is due primarily to an increase in scheduled 

cf industries holdings inc 

turnarounds in 2012 higher spending on environmental health and safety projects and the announced project to increase production and efficiency at our donaldsonville nitrogen complex 

planned capital expenditures for 2012 are subject to change due to unanticipated increases in the cost scope and completion time for example we may experience increases in labor and equipment costs necessary to comply with government regulations or to complete projects that sustain or improve the profitability of our operations 

forward sales 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis including under our forward pricing program fpp at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we generally lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these future sales mainly by using natural gas derivative instruments and fixed price purchase contracts to hedge against price changes for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers as a result of using derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives and our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment unlike nitrogen fertilizer products sold under forward sales contracts for which we effectively fix the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials principally sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate manufacturing costs as a result we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis 

customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which may be several months after the order is placed as is the case for all of our sale transactions revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 we had approximately 2572 million and 4315 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets 

while customer advances were a significant source of liquidity in both 2011 and 2010 the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals the level of forward orders as of december 31 2011 may reflect our customers views of the current fertilizer pricing environment and expectations regarding future pricing and availability of supply 

under the fpp a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of an fpp contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales we may also be subject to storage charges under these arrangements should we be unable to deliver product at the specified time if the level of sales under the fpp were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase also borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity 

cf industries holdings inc 

natural gas derivatives 

we use natural gas derivative instruments primarily to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on forward sales contracts our natural gas acquisition policy also allows us to establish derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our fpp 

natural gas derivatives involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts the counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions cash collateral is deposited with or received from counterparties when predetermined unrealized loss or gain thresholds are exceeded for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties individual credit limits monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements 

the master netting arrangements to our derivative instruments also contain creditriskrelated contingent features that require us to maintain minimum net worth levels and certain financial ratios if we fail to meet these minimum requirements the counterparties to derivative instruments for which we are in net liability positions could require daily cash settlement of unrealized losses or some other form of credit support 

as of december 31 2011 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position was 747 million we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts as of december 31 2011 

financial assurance requirements 

in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment we are subject to financial assurance requirements pursuant to the florida regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure and maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems we established an escrow account to meet such future obligations contributions to this escrow account by rule are earmarked to cover the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack systems upon closure 

in 2010 we entered into a consent decree the plant city consent decree with the us environmental protection agency epa and the florida department of environmental protection fdep with respect to our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex and its compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra in addition to requirements to modify certain operating practices and undertake certain capital improvement projects the plant city consent decree requires us to provide financial assurance with respect to our ability to fund the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the plant city phosphogypsum stack as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure in 2010 we established a trust for the benefit of the epa and the fdep and we deposited approximately 548 million into the trust we also transferred approximately 269 million from our previously established escrow account described above in 2011 we made an additional contribution of 504 million and we expect to deposit approximately the same amount in 2012 at which point the trust will be fully funded additional funding may be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed investment earnings in the trust at december 31 2011 the balance in the trust was 1322 million 

prior to the plant city consent decree our financial assurance requirements for the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the plant city phosphogypsum stack system were determined solely by florida regulations which would have required funding of the escrow account over a period of years the plant city consent decree described above effectively requires us to fund the greater of the requirements under the plant city consent decree or florida law which may differ over 

cf industries holdings inc 

time we are still required under florida law to maintain the existing florida escrow account for the closure longterm maintenance monitoring and water management costs for the phosphogypsum stack system at our closed bartow florida phosphate fertilizer complex we made annual contributions of 37 million and 75 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively to this escrow account no contribution was necessary in 2011 at december 31 2011 the balance in this escrow account was 132 million 

the amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements these expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the trust and escrow accounts which are based on the guidelines set forth in the plant city consent decree and florida regulations ultimately the funds in these accounts will be used to fund the closure and maintenance of the phosphogypsum stack systems 

florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities we will also be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted the demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a trust fund agreement or escrow account based on these current regulations we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in florida utilizing any of these methods 

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

we have operations in canada and interests in corporate joint ventures in the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us are recognized as the amounts are earned unless the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested based upon our current plans however the payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurs at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings can occur in different periods as of december 31 2011 we have recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 220 million which reflects the additional us and foreign income taxes that would be due upon the repatriation of approximately 5000 million of earnings by our nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which is considered not to be permanently reinvested at that date the funding of these tax payments will be made with the cash repatriated from the foreign operations 

other liquidity requirements 

we are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations concerning surface and underground waters such regulations evolve through various stages of proposal or development and the ultimate outcome of such rulemaking activities often cannot be predicted prior to enactment at the present time proposed regulations in the state of florida are being considered to limit nutrient content in water discharges including certain specific regulations pertaining to water bodies near our florida operations we are monitoring the evolution of these proposed regulations potential costs associated with compliance cannot be determined currently and we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we contributed approximately 238 million to our pension plans in the year ended december 31 2011 we expect to contribute approximately 198 million to our pension plans in 2012

operating activities 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

net cash generated from operating activities in 2011 was 21 billion as compared to 12 billion in 2010 the 8845 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to improved net earnings in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments partially offset by lower customer advances and an increase in cash invested in inventory and accounts receivable in 2011 compared to 2010 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

net cash generated from operating activities in 2010 was 11944 million as compared to 6818 million in 2009 the 5126 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the impact of the terra acquisition improved financial performance in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments and favorable working capital changes in the business in 2010 versus 2009 although the net earnings declined marginally between 2009 and 2010 that decline was more than explained by higher depreciation and amortization and an unfavorable change in the unrealized marktomarket adjustments on our natural gas derivatives neither of which had any cash impact during 2010 depreciation depletion and amortization increased by 2938 million due primarily to the acquisition and stepup in value of the acquired terra assets and unrealized marktomarket gains in 2009 were not repeated in 2010 which reduced pretax earnings by 781 million as compared to 2009 the yearoveryear favorable impact on cash flow from operations due to working capital changes was primarily attributable to an increase in customer deposits in 2010 versus a decline in 2009

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer and terminal leases the rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to ten years and the barge charter commitments currently have terms ranging from one to four years we also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements at several of our distribution locations some of which contain minimum throughput requirements the storage agreements contain minimum terms ranging from one to three years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party 

our operating lease agreements do not contain significant contingent rents leasehold incentives rent holidays scheduled rent increases concessions or unusual provisions see note 26 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning leases

property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation is computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction uop method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews 

scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher production costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line entitled additions to property plant and equipment 

inventory valuation 

we review our inventory balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our most recent estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation 

fixed cost writeoff 

fixed costs are considered a part of normal product manufacturing costs and included in inventory value provided that production from a specific plant is greater than 60 of that plants total capacity if production volumes fall below 60 of capacity during the month the related overhead and other fixed costs are expensed in the period as incurred

asset retirement obligations aro and environmental remediation liabilities 

aros are legal obligations associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the bartow and plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complexes land reclamation activities at our hardee florida phosphate rock mine and the cessation of operations at all of our facilities if the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated aros are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service we are required to recognize an aro for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain the obligations at active facilities related to closure reclamation and cessation of operations are capitalized at their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded the liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time the asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over the estimated useful life in the case of reclamation the asset is depreciated over the period the mining occurs which in some cases may be after initial recognition of the liability the aggregate carrying value of all of our aros was 1316 million as of december 31 2011 and 1198 million as of december 31 2010 the increase in the aggregate carrying value of these aros is due to normal accretion expense and recognizing changes in estimates offset by cash expenditures on aros 

environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts existing technology sitespecific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations in reporting environmental liabilities no offset is made for potential recoveries all liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur in accordance with gaap environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits changes in laws regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements the amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled 67 million as of december 31 2011 and 91 million as of december 31 2010 

the actual amounts to be spent on aros and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments and cost inflation as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes we are also required to select discount rates to calculate the present value of aros changes in these estimates or the selection of a different discount rate could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

we have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included is reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2011 dollars is 470 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros at december 31 2011 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion

recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in accordance with gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review 

the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired we review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries annually to determine if there is a loss in value of the investment we determine the fair value of the investment using an income approach valuation method if the sum of the expected future discounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized immediately 

goodwill is evaluated in the fourth quarter for impairment at the reporting unit level in our case the nitrogen and phosphate segments there is a two step impairment test the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we use an income based valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit no goodwill impairment was identified in our 2011 or 2010 reviews as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had 21 billion of goodwill resulting mainly from the terra acquisition 

fair value measurements 

we have classified our investments in auction rate securities as those measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 securities under the provisions of the current rules for assessing fair value see the liquidity and capital resources section of this discussion and analysis for detailed information concerning the critical accounting estimates involved in valuing and classifying these investments no other assets or liabilities are classified as level 3 items on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning fair value measurements 

income taxes 

we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in 

cf industries holdings inc 

time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period when these changes occur 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

a deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in the companys nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which is considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income taxes have been recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested 

as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods 

in connection with our initial public offering ipo in august 2005 cf industries inc cfi ceased to be nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes and we entered into a net operating loss agreement nol agreement with cfis preipo owners relating to the future utilization of the preipo net operating loss carryforwards nols under the nol agreement if it is finally determined that the nols can be utilized to offset applicable postipo taxable income we will pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the utilization of nols 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 7633 million at december 31 2011 which was 1099 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2011 pbo was computed based on a weighted average discount rate of 46 which was based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 525 million higher or 472 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussed the weighted average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2011 was 54 if the discount rate used to compute 2011 pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 26 million higher or 20 million lower 

cf industries holdings inc 

respectively than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 61 weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2011 would have been 28 million lower or higher respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our pension plans 

retiree medical benefits 

retiree medical benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions including discount rates used to compute the present value of the future obligations and expected increases in health care costs changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs affect the recorded amount of retiree medical benefits expense 

stockbased compensation 

costs associated with stockbased compensation are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations at the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards over the service period the fair value of nonqualified stock options granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes option valuation model key assumptions used in the blackscholes option valuation model include expected volatility and expected term the weightedaverage expected volatility used to value the stock options granted in 2011 was 53 if the expected volatility was 2 higher or lower the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 3 higher or lower respectively the expected term of the stock options granted in 2011 was five years if the expected term was six months longer or shorter the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 4 higher or lower respectively 

we accrue the cost of stockbased awards on the straightline method over the applicable vesting period as a result total compensation cost recognized for 2011 on a pretax basis was 99 million as of december 31 2011 on a pretax basis there was approximately 108 million and 59 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonqualified options and restricted stock which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 21 and 20 years respectively see note 30 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of stockbased compensation 

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest as well as variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary our judgment in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our level of involvement in setting up the entity determining whether the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on our behalf determining whether we provide more than half the subordinated financial support to the entity and determining whether we direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses or returns 

we use the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies plus the amortization expense of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of purchase accounting our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions we regularly review our variable interest entities for potential changes in consolidation status

discussion of seasonality impacts on operations 

our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices the valuation of our investments interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to fertilizer sales are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia urea and uan 32 by approximately 33 22 and 13 respectively 

we use natural gas in the manufacture of our nitrogen products natural gas prices are volatile we manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering periods not exceeding three years 

the derivative instruments that we use currently are natural gas swap contracts these contracts settle using nymex futures price indexes which represent fair value at any given time the contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods 

we account for derivatives under asc 815— derivatives and hedging  under this section derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and changes in their fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the normal purchase and sale exemption applies we use natural gas derivatives primarily as an economic hedge of gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting under asc 815 accordingly changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities 

as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 we had open derivative contracts for 1563 million mmbtus and 518 million mmbtus respectively of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2011 we used derivatives to cover approximately 66 of our natural gas consumption an overall 100 per mmbtu change in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change the pretax unrealized marktomarket gainloss on these derivative positions by 1563 million 

cf industries holdings inc 

we purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of dap and map there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered through increases in selling prices we enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices a 10 per ton change in the related cost of a ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change dap production cost by 210 per ton and 380 per ton respectively we also may from time to time purchase ammonia urea uan dap and map to augment or replace production at our facilities 

investments in auction rate securities 

as of december 31 2011 we had 709 million of investments in auction rate securities consisting of availableforsale tax exempt auction rate securities that were all supported by student loans that were originated primarily under the federal family education loan program due to the illiquidity in the credit markets auctions for these securities have generally failed as a result we do not consider these investments to be liquid investments and we will not be able to access these funds until such time as auctions for these securities are successful buyers are found outside of the auction process or the securities are redeemed by the issuer further details regarding these securities are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources both in this form 10k 

the valuation of these securities utilizes a marktomodel approach that relies on discounted cash flows market data and inputs that are derived from similar instruments based on this valuation the unrealized holding loss against the cost basis in the investments at december 31 2011 was 47 million the unrealized holding loss has been reported in other comprehensive income and the impact of the unrealized holding loss is recorded in the net 709 million investment balance in auction rate securities if the required rate of return we used in the calculation model was 100 basis points higher the resulting holding loss would have been approximately 42 million higher we may need to recognize either additional holding gains or losses in other comprehensive income or holding losses in net earnings should changes occur in either the conditions in the credit markets the credit quality of the issuers or in the variables considered in our valuation model 

upon a failed auction the instrument carries an interest rate based upon certain predefined formulas a 100 basis point change in the average rate of interest earned on these investments would result in a 08 million change in pretax income on an annual basis 

interest rate fluctuations 

as of december 31 2011 we had 8000 million of senior notes outstanding with an original maturity date of may 1 2018 and 8000 million of senior notes outstanding with an original maturity date of may 1 2020 the senior notes have fixed interest rates in addition we had 130 million of the terra 7 senior notes due 2017 outstanding the fair value of our longterm debt at december 31 2011 was approximately 19 billion our senior secured revolving credit facility bears a current market rate of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on borrowings under the facility however as of december 31 2011 there were no borrowings under the facility 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we are directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the swiss franc at the present time we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to foreign currencies

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

we operated as a traditional supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock and listing on the new york stock exchange we sold approximately 474 million shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds of approximately 7154 million in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries inc now our whollyowned subsidiary were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and approximately 76 million shares of our common stock 

in april 2010 we acquired terra pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger for a total purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities a 75 interest in another nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility and certain joint venture interests

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in 2010 natural gas accounted for approximately 45 of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities access abundant competitivelypriced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities we have facilities located at or near henry hub in louisiana oneok in oklahoma aeco in alberta ventura in iowa and dawn in ontario 

our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consume in the aggregate in excess of 250 million mmbtus of natural gas annually we employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced supply of natural gas we also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices for further information about our natural gas hedging activities see notes to consolidated financial statements note 28—derivative financial instruments 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the safe efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer to terminals warehouses and customers each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on production capability and location 

all seven of our north american production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the us and canada with access to our leased railcar fleet that currently approximates 5000 tank and hopper cars as well as railcars provided by rail carriers 

the north american waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our donaldsonville verdigris and yazoo city facilities we employ a fleet of ten leased tow boats and 32 river barges to ship ammonia and uan consisting of 26 leased barges and six owned ammonia barges we also utilize contract marine services to move urea and phosphate fertilizers 

three of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia the donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2000mile long nustar pipeline through which we transport ammonia to over 20 terminals and shipping points located in the midwestern us corn belt our verdigris and port neal facilities are connected to the 1100mile long magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the us midwest

phosphate segment 

we are a major manufacturer of phosphate fertilizer products our main phosphate fertilizer products are dap and map we also sold potash fertilizer in 2009 but have ceased sales of this product potash results are included in the phosphate segment 

our historical sales of phosphate fertilizer products are shown in the table below 



gross margin for the phosphate segment was 1528 million 552 million and 4524 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively total assets for the phosphate segment were 6183 million and 5413 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

our phosphate fertilizer manufacturing operations are located in central florida and consist of a phosphate fertilizer chemical complex in plant city a phosphate rock mine a beneficiation plant and phosphate rock reserves in hardee county and a deepwater terminal facility in the port of tampa we own each of these facilities and properties 

the following table summarizes our phosphate fertilizer production volumes for the last three years and current production capacities for phosphaterelated products 



1 p 2 o 5 is the basic measure of the nutrient content in phosphate fertilizer products hardee county phosphate rock mine 

in 1975 we purchased 20000 acres of land in hardee county florida that was originally estimated to contain in excess of 100 million tons of recoverable rock reserves between 1978 and mid1993 we operated a one million ton per year phosphate rock mine on a 5000acre portion of these reserves 

in 1992 we initiated a project to expand and relocate mining operations to the remaining 15000acre area of the reserve property this phosphate rock mine cost 135 million and began operations in late 1995 in 1997 we added approximately 20 million tons to our reserve base through 

cf industries holdings inc 

an exchange with a neighboring rock producer in 1999 we acquired 1400 acres of land containing an estimated 8 million tons of rock reserves in 2008 we acquired approximately 800 acres of land containing an estimated 16 million tons of rock reserves and in 2009 we acquired approximately 175 acres of land containing an estimated 14 million tons of rock reserves 

the table below shows the estimated reserves at the hardee phosphate complex as of december 31 2010 also reflected in the table is the grade of the reserves expressed as a percentage of bone phosphate of lime bpl and p 2 o 5  the table also reflects the average values of the following material contaminants contained in the reserves ferrous oxide fe 2 o 3  plus aluminum oxide al 2 o 3  and magnesium oxide mgo 

proven and probable reserves 1 hardee phosphate complex as of december 31 2010 



1 the minimum drill hole density for the proven reserves classification is 1 hole per 20 acres 2 the reserve estimates provided have been developed by the company in accordance with industry guide 7 promulgated by the sec we estimate that 99 of the reserves are proven 

our phosphate reserve estimates are based on geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff geologist as of december 31 2010 reserve estimates are updated periodically to reflect actual phosphate rock recovered new drilling information and other geological or mining data estimates for 99 of the reserves are based on 20acre density drilling 

plant city phosphate complex 

our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in north america at one million tons per year its phosphoric acid capacity represents approximately 10 of the total us capacity all of plant citys phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates dap and map representing approximately 14 of us capacity for ammonium phosphate fertilizer products in 2010 the combination of the plant city phosphate fertilizer complex and the hardee mine gives us one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in north america 

bartow phosphate complex 

we own a former phosphate manufacturing complex in bartow florida that ceased production in 1999 the former manufacturing facilities have since been dismantled and disposed of in accordance with local laws and regulations the phosphogypsum stack has been closed and the former storage and distribution facilities were sold along with excess land we continue to be obligated for the closure of the cooling pond management of water treatment on the site and providing longterm care for the site in accordance with regulatory requirements

phosphate raw materials 

phosphate rock supply phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers approximately 35 tons of phosphate rock are needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5 the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex typically consumes in excess of three million tons of rock annually as of december 31 2010 our hardee rock mine had approximately 12 years of fully permitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our hardee property where we can mine the expanded area has an estimated 34 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves we estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately ten additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area 

sulfur supply sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid approximately three quarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5  our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 800000 long tons of sulfur annually when operating at capacity we obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration in 2010 martin sulphur our largest molten sulfur supplier supplied approximately 62 of the molten sulfur used at plant city 

ammonia supply dap and map have a nitrogen content of 18 and 11 respectively and a phosphate nutrient content of 46 and 52 respectively ammonia is the primary source of nitrogen in dap and map operating at capacity our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex consumes approximately 400000 tons of ammonia annually 

the ammonia used at our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia storage facility located in tampa florida this facility consists of a 38000ton ammonia storage tank access to a deepwater dock that is capable of discharging oceangoing vessels and rail and truck loading facilities in addition to supplying our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex our tampa ammonia distribution system has the capacity to support ammonia sales to and distribution services for other customers sales of ammonia from our tampa terminal are reported in our nitrogen business segment the ammonia supply for tampa is purchased from offshore sources providing us with access to the broad international ammonia market 

phosphate distribution 

we operate a phosphate fertilizer warehouse located at a deepwater port facility in tampa florida most of the phosphate fertilizer produced at plant city is shipped by truck or rail to our tampa warehouse where it is loaded onto vessels for shipment to export customers or for transport across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river in 2010 our tampa warehouse handled approximately 12 million tons of phosphate fertilizers or about 65 of our production the remainder of our phosphate fertilizer production is transported by truck or rail directly to customers or to inmarket storage facilities 

phosphate fertilizer shipped across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river is transferred into river barges near new orleans phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is transported to our storage facilities or delivered directly to customers river transportation is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators

competition 

our markets are intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

in our nitrogen segment our primary north americanbased competitors are agrium and koch nitrogen fertilizers there is also significant competition from product sourced from other regions of 

cf industries holdings inc 

the world including some with lower natural gas costs because urea is a widelytraded fertilizer product and there are limited barriers to entry competition from foreignsourced product is particularly acute with respect to urea 

in our phosphate segment our primary north americanbased competitors are agrium mosaic potash corp and simplot historically imports have not been a significant factor as the united states is a large net exporter of phosphate fertilizers 

seasonality 

the sales patterns of all six of our major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

financial information about foreign and domestic sales and operations 

the amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying value of our foreign and domestic assets are set forth in note 33—segment disclosures

currently we are subject to regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states concerning climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions for information regarding this issue refer to item 1a risk factors 

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and mining permits authorizing operations at our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals 

as of december 31 2010 the area permitted for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 424 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which we expect to meet our requirements at current production rates for approximately 12 years we have secured the necessary permits to mine these reserves from the fdep and the us army corps of engineers we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated additional 34 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which we expect will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately ten additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area the estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective of the anticipated permittable mining areas based on recent similar permitting efforts in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

likewise our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2014 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits we have secured the local development authorization to increase the capacity of this stack 

cf industries holdings inc 

system based on this authorization estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately eight years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in certain cases as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities we currently utilize a trust established for the benefit of the epa and the fdep and an escrow account established for the benefit of the fdep as a means of complying with financial assurance requirements for the closure and longterm care of our phosphogypsum stack systems for additional information on the cash deposit arrangements see note 15—asset retirement obligations 

several of our permits including our mining permit at the hardee phosphate complex require us to reclaim any property disturbed by our operations at our hardee property we currently mine approximately 300 to 400 acres of land each year all of which must be reclaimed the costs to reclaim this land vary based on the type of land involved and range from 3700 to 18000 an acre with an average of 9800 an acre for additional information on our hardee asset retirement obligations see note 15—asset retirement obligations 

our phosphate operations in florida are subject to regulations governing the closure and longterm maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at our bartow phosphate complex we estimate that we will spend a total of approximately 2 million between 2011 and 2016 to complete closure of the cooling pond and channels water treating expenditures at bartow are estimated to require about 14 million over the next 46 years postclosure longterm care expenditures at bartow are estimated to total approximately 51 million for a 52 year period including 2011 to close the phosphogypsum stack currently in use at the plant city phosphate complex we estimate that we will spend approximately 65 million during the years 2033 through 2037 and another 45 million in 2087 to close the cooling pond water treating expenditures at plant city are estimated to approximate 6 million in 2018 64 million in 2033 through 2037 and 167 million thereafter through 2087 postclosure longterm care expenditures at plant city are estimated to total 107 million for a 50 year period commencing in 2038 these amounts are in nominal dollars using an assumed inflation rate of 3 

cost estimates for closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems are based on formal closure plans submitted to the state of florida which are subject to revision during negotiations over the next several years moreover the time frame involved in the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems extends as far as the year 2087 accordingly the actual amount to be spent also will depend upon factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation and changes in applicable laws and regulations these cost estimates may also increase if the plant city phosphogypsum stack is expanded further for additional information on asset retirement obligations related to our phosphogypsum systems see note 15—asset retirement obligations

 item 1a risk factors 

  our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and the market prices of our securities additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and the market prices of our securities 

our business is dependent on natural gas which is subject to a high level of price volatility 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea uan an and other nitrogen products natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total cost of our nitrogen fertilizers 

because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our production costs the price of natural gas in north america is highly volatile during 2010 the median daily price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america reached a high of 751 per mmbtu on january 8 2010 and a low of 318 per mmbtu on october 26 2010 the market price of natural gas in north america is not linked to other world gas prices and is also higher than the price of natural gas in certain other major fertilizerproducing regions including the middle east in addition to having access to lowerpriced natural gas some of our competitors may also benefit from fixedprice natural gas contracts or from contracts linked directly to the market price of the nitrogen fertilizer being manufactured recent declines in the price of north american natural gas have been driven in part by the development of new sources of natural gas for the north american market including unconventional sources such as shale gas exploration and development of new natural gas fields and natural gas imports in the form of liquid natural gas any limitation on these sources of natural gas as a result of the environmental concerns raised with the development of new natural gas fields or the techniques used to recover shale gas or otherwise could cause the price of natural gas in north america to rise significantly given the volatility of pricing and our dependence on north american natural gas the price we pay for natural gas in the future may be higher than prices paid by producers in certain other fertilizerproducing regions of the world which may make it more difficult for us to compete against these producers 

our production facilities outside north america particularly those in the united kingdom are like those in north america also subject to high natural gas prices relative to those in certain other major fertilizerproducing regions and to significant natural gas price volatility 

we may not be able to pass along higher operating costs to our customers in the form of higher product prices a significant increase in the price of natural gas which can be driven by among other things supply disruptions governmental or regulatory actions cold weather and oil price spikes that is not hedged or recovered through an increase in the price of related nitrogen products could result in reduced profit margins and lower production levels if market prices for our products are below our cost of production due to the high cost of natural gas we may shift our sourcing of nitrogen fertilizers from manufactured to purchased products in the past we have idled one or more of our nitrogen fertilizer plants occasionally in response to high natural gas prices and may do so again in the future during late 2005 and early 2006 for example we curtailed production of fertilizers at the cf industries donaldsonville complex for this reason

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our results of operations tend to be negatively impacted 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by population growth changes in dietary habits nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels and planted acreage and application rates among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade 

periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacity 

during periods of industry oversupply our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory andor temporary or permanent curtailments of production 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities 

some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities consolidation in the fertilizer industry has increased the resources of several of our competitors such consolidation could continue and our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships 

china the worlds largest producer and consumer of fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may face increased competition from russian and ukrainian urea and ammonium nitrate urea imports from russia and ukraine are currently subject to antidumping orders that impose significant duties ranging from approximately 22 to 68 percent on urea imported into the united states from these two countries russia and ukraine currently have considerable capacity to produce urea and are the worlds largest urea exporters in russia the price for natural gas used for industrial production continues to be set by the government and is below its market value russian nitrogen fertilizer producers benefit from these governmentcontrolled prices encouraging inefficient urea production and high volumes of exports in ukraine the government intervenes with respect to natural gas prices available to fertilizer producers so as to permit continued exports the antidumping orders have been in place since 1987 and there has been very little urea imported into the united states from russia or ukraine since that time in august of 2010 the us department of commerce completed its review of recent us sales made by the russian exporter eurochem and concluded that these sales had been priced almost 22 percent below their fair value it ordered that antidumping duties be collected on those sales in december 2010 the us department of commerce and the us 

cf industries holdings inc 

international trade commission initiated the third sunset review of the urea antidumping orders to determine whether they should be kept in place for an additional five years the sunset review process is expected to be completed in late 2011 or early 2012 if the antidumping duty orders do not continue we may face increased competition from unfairly priced urea from russia and ukraine which could have a negative impact on our selling prices and sales volumes 

fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia is subject to an antidumping suspension agreement that governs the minimum prices and maximum volumes of imports of this product into the united states volumes are limited to no more than 150000 metric tons per year and minimum prices are tied to pricing levels in the us market these restrictions have been in place since 2000 russia is by far the worlds largest ammonium nitrate producer and exporter as in the case of urea russian ammonium nitrate producers benefit from belowmarket pricing of natural gas in march 2011 the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission will initiate the second sunset review of the russian ammonium nitrate suspension agreement this process will be completed in the first half of 2012 if the suspension agreement is terminated we may face increased competition from large volumes of unfairly priced russian ammonium nitrate which could have a negative impact on selling prices and sales volumes of fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from ukraine is subject to an antidumping duty order under which imports of this product are currently subject to a duty of over 156 percent that order will be reviewed beginning in june 2012 

a decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products 

conditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products 

state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications in recent years for example ethanol production in the united states has increased significantly due in part to federal legislation mandating greater use of renewable fuels this increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuels standard or rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to reduce subsidies for ethanol allow increased ethanol imports and adopt temporary waivers of the current rfs levels any of which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition several states are currently considering limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment 

we rely on third party providers of transportation services and equipment which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations 

we rely on railroad trucking pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars from rail car owners in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are 

cf industries holdings inc 

subject to various hazards including extreme weather conditions work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of our raw materials or finished products 

if we are delayed or are unable to ship our finished products or obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our sales revenues andor cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

the railroad industry has initiated various efforts to limit the railroads potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard or tih materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities these efforts by the railroads include i requesting that the surface transportation board or stb issue a policy statement finding that it is reasonable for a railroad to require a shipper to indemnify the railroads and carry insurance for all liability above a certain amount arising from the transportation of tih materials ii requesting that the stb approve an increase in the maximum reasonable rates that a railroad can charge for the transportation of tih materials and iii lobbying for new legislation or regulations that would limit or eliminate the railroads common carrier obligation to transport tih materials if the railroads were to succeed in one or more of these initiatives it could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads 

new regulations could also be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products the us railroad industry is developing higher ammonia tank car performance standards which could require the modification or replacement of our leased tank car fleet the effective date of these new regulations is not known at this time however the federal railroad administration has approved an interim car design for a 20 year period in 2010 we contracted to switch a significant portion of our leased fleet over the next 5 years to this interim car the higher standards could adversely impact our cost of operations and our ability to obtain an adequate supply of rail cars to support our operations 

integrating the business operations and information management systems of cf industries and terra is continuing and integration difficulties could result in disruptions in business operations andor adverse operating results 

we are continuing the process of integrating terras operations with the operations of cf industries the integration of two companies as large as cf and terra is a complex process and we may encounter substantial difficulties as we complete integration of the two companies any difficulties in the integration work could result in a delay or the failure to achieve all of the anticipated benefits and synergies of the acquisition and therefore all of the expected cost savings and other synergies additionally these cost savings may be less than we currently expect or may be realized later than originally expected 

the difficulties of integrating terras operations with those of cf include among other things exposure to unanticipated costs expenses or liabilities the use of separate management information 

cf industries holdings inc 

systems and the implementation of new or replacement systems the transfer of processes and consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures 

cf industries and terra utilized separate information management systems to process transactions governing core business operations to fully integrate the terra operations into cf industries business processes and to achieve the benefits of the acquisition cf industries has initiated a project to consolidate all business processes for the combined companies under a new single enterprise resource planning erp system utilizing software provided by sap this multiyear companywide program will align business processes and procedures institute more efficient transaction processing and improve access to and consistency of information to enable standardization of business activities we expect to implement this system in 2012 the implementation of an erp system across the combined organization entails certain risks if we do not implement the system successfully and within the planned budget or if the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner it could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products and increase the cost of natural gas 

weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts can also dramatically affect the price of natural gas our principal raw material used to make nitrogen based fertilizers colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand of natural gas for residential and industrial use in addition hurricanes affecting the gulf coastal states can severely impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise sharply 

expansion of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both domestically and in foreign locations major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments require significant managerial resources which may be diverted from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other investments 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and trinidad including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act 

cf industries holdings inc 

the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes 

as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations additionally future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or more vigorous enforcement of current laws and regulations whether caused by violations of environmental and health and safety laws by us or other chemical fertilizer companies or otherwise may require us to make substantial expenditures additionally our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have liability as a potentially responsible party at certain sites under certain environmental remediation laws and have also been subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage and possible personal injury arising from contamination relating to active as well as discontinued operations we may be subject to additional liability or additional claims in the future some of these matters may require significant expenditures for investigation andor cleanup or other costs 

from time to time our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury although to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our carrier refuses coverage for these losses 

on august 18 2009 the epa entered into a consent decree with environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court judge on november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 the epa intends to propose numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters in 2011 and finalize such criteria in 2012 the final numeric water quality criteria for lakes and inland flowing waters are substantially lower than water quality criteria that have been developed and applied in florida on a casebycase basis cf industries along with the state of florida local wastewater utilities other industrial entities including other fertilizer manufacturers and environmental groups have filed suit in federal district court in florida challenging the regulation 

on september 30 2009 the epa proposed a total maximum daily load or tmdl for certain bodies of water within the charlotte harbor and peace river watersheds in florida the proposed tmdl specifies a zero nutrient load from all national pollutant discharge elimination system or 

cf industries holdings inc 

npdes dischargers within these watersheds including our npdes discharge associated with our mining operation in hardee county in response to significant public comment the epa did not finalize the proposed tmdl the epa may finalize or reissue its notice of the tmdl or a variation thereof in the future but to date the agency has shown no indication of doing so 

the outcomes of these regulatory initiatives including the outcomes of legal challenges to these initiatives could result in more stringent waste water discharge limits for our mining manufacturing and distribution operations in florida the specific limits imposed on wastewater discharges from our facilities will depend on the criteria that are adopted and the development of specific permit conditions that are consistent with these criteria more stringent limits could increase our costs andor limit our operations and therefore could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are dependent on numerous required permits approvals and meeting financial assurance requirements from governmental authorities 

we hold numerous environmental mining and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion of our operations is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in certain cases as a condition to procure such permits and approvals or as a condition to maintain existing approvals we may be required to comply with regulatory financial assurance requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure local state or federal government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities for example in 2006 we established an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection fdep as a means of complying with floridas regulations governing financial assurance related to closure and postclosure of phosphogypsum stacks also in 2010 pursuant to a consent decree with the us epa and the fdep we funded a trust as a means of complying with similar requirements for closure post closure and monitoring of the phosphogypsum stack system at our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex 

florida regulations also mandate payment of certain mining taxes based on the quantity of ore mined and are subject to change based on local regulatory approvals additional financial assurance requirements or other increases in local mining regulations and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

florida regulations also require phosphate rock mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities the demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds letters of credit insurance policies or similar instruments it is possible that we will not be able to comply with either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2010 the area permitted by local state and federal authorities for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 424 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock 

cf industries holdings inc 

reserves which will meet our requirements at current operating rates for approximately 12 years we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated 34 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

likewise our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2014 at current operating rates and is subject to regular renewals of our operating permits we have secured the local development authorization to increase the capacity of this stack system based on this authorization estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately eight years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our operating results 

currently we are subject to climate change regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of future climate change regulations more stringent greenhouse gas ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have significant impacts on the fertilizer industry due to the fact that our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our operating results in addition to the extent that climate change restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate are less stringent than in the united states or canada our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us 

the united kingdom a party to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas trading system our joint venture uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require the joint venture to purchase co 2 emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our joint venture uk sites are also subject to the european union emissions trading scheme more stringent ghg emission limits in the uk and europe are expected to go into effect beginning in 2013 although the amount of additional reductions may depend in part on whether further international ghg agreements are reached for the post2012 period 

in canada also a party to the kyoto protocol we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canadas national pollutant release inventory and ontarios mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation ontario has also joined the western climate initiative comprised of several states in the 

cf industries holdings inc 

western us and several canadian provinces which intends to establish a cap and trade regime for the trading of ghg credits within the regional area ostensibly commencing in 2012 

in the united states not a party to the kyoto protocol climate change action is evolving at state regional and federal levels although there were federal legislative developments in the 111 th congress including the passage of a comprehensive climate change bill in the house of representatives efforts to pass such legislation have ceased however the epa has begun to issue federal ghg regulations that impact our facilities including a mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in may 2010 the epa issued the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule this regulation establishes that the construction of new or modification of existing major sources of ghg emissions would become subject to the psd air permitting program and later the title v permitting program beginning in january 2011 although the regulation also significantly increases the emissions thresholds that would subject facilities to these regulations this regulation along with other ghg regulations and determinations issued by the epa is currently subject to judicial appeal regulation of ghg emissions pursuant to the psd program could subject new capital projects to additional permitting requirements that may result in delays in completing such projects 

our port neal iowa facility is subject to a state regulation that requires the reporting of ghg emissions as part of its annual air emissions inventory reports other than the states implementation of the tailoring rule none of the states where our us production facilities are located—florida louisiana mississippi iowa and oklahoma—has proposed regulations limiting ghg emissions however coalitions of states in the northeast midwest including iowa and west as noted above have been working together to develop regional ghg emission reduction programs there is substantial uncertainty in the nearterm with respect to the development of ghg emissions regulations by the states that had signed the midwest accord 

our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively impacted by any related increased storage costs andor liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are particularly acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the highly volatile cost of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers 

cf industries holdings inc 

a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our operating results liquidity and financial condition 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis including under our forward pricing program fpp at prices and delivery dates we propose this improves our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allows us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing assets 

under our fpp customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and generally pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date thereby significantly increasing our liquidity any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months or more as of december 31 2010 and 2009 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders equaled approximately 54 and 18 respectively of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

we believe the ability to purchase product on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we generally use natural gas derivatives or fixed price fertilizer purchase contracts to hedge against changes in the price of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our supply cost the use of derivatives to lock in the natural gas portion of our margins on forward sales of nitrogen products can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives prior to the purchase of the natural gas 

we also sell phosphate products on a forward basis including under the fpp in 2010 forward sales of phosphate fertilizer products represented approximately 45 of our phosphate fertilizer volume unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products where we have the opportunity to fix the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate fertilizer costs as a result we are typically exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis 

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses 

we manage commodity price risk for our business although we have risk measurement systems that use various methodologies to quantify the risk these systems might not always be followed or might not always work as planned further such risk measurement systems do not in themselves manage risk even if risks have been identified our earnings cash flows and balance sheet could be adversely affected by changes involving volatility changes involving adverse correlation of commodity prices or market liquidity issues our ability to manage exposure to commodity price risk through the 

cf industries holdings inc 

use of financial derivatives also may be affected by limitations imposed by the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness 

in order to manage financial exposure to commodity price and market fluctuations we utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen based fertilizers in these hedging activities we have used fixedprice forward physical purchase and sales contracts including forward contracts under the fpp futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter or otc markets or on exchanges nevertheless no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract or industry therefore unhedged risks will always continue to exist 

in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions the credit and economic crisis that started in 2008 impacted a number of financial institutions some of which participate as counterparties to our natural gas swaps we monitor the swap portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with any one counterparty as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties established credit limits cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on derivative settlements 

federal legislation is also under consideration that could add substantial regulation to derivatives markets with emphasis on otc derivatives which could adversely affect our business some of the most stringent legislation proposed would require most market participants to utilize a formal exchange for these transactions utilizing a formal exchange requires gains or losses on derivatives to be settled daily with the exchange transacting derivatives overthecounter rather than through an exchange enables us to take advantage of favorable credit lines provided by our counterparties through these credit lines we are not required to post collateral on our derivatives unless their value surpasses an established threshold if we were forced to utilize an exchange the cost of utilizing derivatives could increase which would adversely affect our cost of operations and could negatively impact our liquidity 

our operations are reliant on a limited number of key facilities that involve significant risks and hazards against which we may not be fully insured 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and they may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities for example 

• an explosion in 1994 at the port neal iowa facility resulted in nearly the entire facility being rebuilt • over the course of the past few years we have been involved in numerous property damage and personal injury lawsuits arising out of a hydrogen explosion in 2000 at the donaldsonville facility in which three people died and several others were injured 27 

cf industries holdings inc 

• a fire in early 2008 at the medicine hat alberta facility required us to shut down the facility for approximately one month and • a fatal release of anhydrous ammonia occurred in november 2009 during loading operations at our ammonia terminal at pine bend minnesota a truck driver died at the scene and a second truck driver subsequently died from injuries sustained at the scene the potential impact on us of these types of events is increased because of our reliance on a limited number of key facilities our nitrogen fertilizer operations are dependent on seven separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the combined donaldsonville complex which represents approximately 40 of the companys ammonia production capacity our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on our phosphate mine and associated beneficiation plant in hardee county florida our phosphate fertilizer complex in plant city florida and our ammonia terminal in tampa florida the suspension of operations at any of these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments under our fpp and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a number of our key facilities including the donaldsonville complex and all of our phosphate operations are located in regions of the united states that experience a relatively high level of hurricane activity such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas and sulfur in the gulf of mexico region 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we are subject to various selfretentions and deductibles under these insurance policies as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 

we are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventures 

we participate in joint ventures including cfl which owns our facility in medicine hat alberta point lisas which owns our facility in trinidad growhow which owns our facilities in billingham and ince united kingdom and keytrade ag or keytrade our joint venture partners may share or have majority control over the operations of our joint ventures as a result our investments in joint ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our joint ventures or our partners have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions requests policies or objectives subject the joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business 

in addition we may become involved in disputes with our joint venture partners which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities our plants and ancillary facilities may be targets of terrorist activities many of these plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other items that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct 

cf industries holdings inc 

targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives local state federal and foreign governments could implement new regulations impacting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues andor reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell an in the united states and through our growhow joint venture in the united kingdom an can be used as an explosive and was used in the oklahoma city bombing in april 1995 it is possible that the us or uk governments could impose limitations on the use sale or distribution of an thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell that product 

our operations are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and an increase in the price or any delay or interruption in the delivery of these raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas ammonia and sulfur as raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase these raw materials from thirdparty suppliers prices for these raw materials can fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand we may not be able to pass along to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business these products are transported by barge truck rail or pipeline to our facilities by thirdparty transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw materials including those caused by capacity constraints explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving pipelines deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime or labor difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations 

our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions during 2010 we derived approximately 15 of our net sales from outside of the united states our business operations include a 50 interest in an ammonia production joint venture in trinidad and a 50 interest in a uk joint venture for the production of anhydrous ammonia and other fertilizer products we are also evaluating development of a new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in peru 

our customer base is concentrated with certain large customers accounting for a substantial portion of our sales 

in 2010 our top ten customers represented approximately 50 of our total consolidated net sales three customers—chs inc or chs gavilon fertilizer llc or gavilon and growmark inc or growmark on a combined basis represented approximately 23 of our consolidated net sales we have multiyear supply contracts with growmark and gavilon that both expire on june 30 2013 we depend on these customers for a significant portion of our sales and may have less flexibility than 

cf industries holdings inc 

some of our competitors to seek profitable sales to other customers a substantial change in purchasing decisions by any or all of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our investments in securities are subject to risks that may result in losses 

we invest in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us government those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities our investments are subject to fluctuations in both market value and yield based upon changes in market conditions including interest rates liquidity general economic and credit market conditions and conditions specific to the issuers 

at december 31 2010 we held investments of 1028 million in taxexempt auction rate securities these securities were issued by various state and local government entities and are all supported by student loans that were issued primarily under the federal family loan program these auction rate securities have stated maturities that range up to 37 years and the underlying securities are guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities although redemptions have occurred sporadically currently there is no active market for these investments and we continue to hold them until liquidity resumes in the marketplace or we recover our investment by other means 

due to the risks of investments we may not achieve expected returns or may realize losses on our investments which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could impact the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories the overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted 

our substantial indebtedness and covenant restrictions under our indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

we historically operated with very limited indebtedness but incurred substantial indebtedness in 2010 to finance the terra acquisition our increased indebtedness could have important consequences on our business in adversely affecting our operations and liquidity and we may not be able to reduce our financial leverage when we choose to do so our substantial indebtedness could among other things 

• make it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments • cause us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital and capital expenditures research and development and other business activities 30 

cf industries holdings inc 

• cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions • cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions • cause us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage • result in a downgrade in our credit rating or that of our indebtedness which could increase the cost of further borrowings and • limit our ability to borrow additional money in the future to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the terms of our indebtedness include covenants restricting our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to engage in other business activities including among other things making investments and conducting asset dispositions 

if we are unable to comply with restrictions in the credit facilities or debt incurred in replacement thereof including the senior notes the indebtedness thereunder could be accelerated 

the agreements governing the credit facilities and agreements governing debt we may incur in replacement thereof including the senior notes impose or may impose restrictions on us and require certain payments of principal and interest over time a failure to comply with these restrictions or to make these payments could lead to an event of default that could result in an acceleration of the related indebtedness we cannot make any assurances that our future operating results will be sufficient to ensure compliance with the covenants in our agreements or to remedy any such default in the event of an acceleration of this indebtedness we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments 

we may be unable to refinance our debt upon a change of control 

in the event that we experience an event constituting a change of control we may need to refinance large amounts of debt in particular a change of control as defined for purposes of the credit facilities and the term loan facility would constitute an event of default under the credit facilities we may not be able to replace the credit facilities on terms equal to or more favorable than the current terms if the commitments are terminated and the loans are repaid under the credit facilities upon an event of default the indenture governing the senior notes would require that if a change of control as defined for purposes of the indenture occurs we offer to buy back the senior notes for a price equal to 101 of the debt securities principal amount plus any interest that has accrued and remains unpaid as of the repurchase date there can be no assurance that there would be sufficient funds available for any repurchases that could be required by a change of control 

the loss of key members of our management and professional staff may adversely affect our business 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our senior management and professional staff the loss of one or more key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally if we are unable to find hire and retain needed key personnel in the future our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

clean air act investigation 

on march 19 2007 the company received a letter from the epa under section 114 of the federal clean air act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with new source review new source performance standards and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants at the plant city facility the company provided the requested information to the epa in late 2007 the epa initiated this same process in relation to numerous other sulfuric acid plants and phosphoric acid plants throughout the nation including other facilities in florida 

the company received a nov from the epa by letter dated june 16 2010 the nov alleges the company violated the prevention of significant deterioration psd clean air act regulations relating to certain projects undertaken at the plant city facilitys sulfuric acid plants this nov further alleges that the actions that are the basis for the alleged psd violations also resulted in violations of title v air operating permit regulations finally the nov alleges that the company failed to comply with certain compliance dates established by hazardous air pollutant regulations for phosphoric acid manufacturing plants and phosphate fertilizer production plants the company has had an initial meeting with the epa to discuss these alleged violations the company does not know at this time if it will settle this matter prior to initiation of formal legal action 

we cannot estimate the potential penalties fines or other expenditures if any that may result from the clean air act nov and therefore we cannot determine if the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows

our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern us grainproducing states and other major agricultural areas of the united states and canada we also serve offshore markets through exports of nitrogen fertilizer products from our donaldsonville louisiana manufacturing facilities and phosphate fertilizer products from our florida phosphate operations through our tampa port facility as well as from our nitrogen fertilizer jointventure production facilities in the republic of trinidad and tobago and the united kingdom 

the principal customers for both our nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors 

in april 2010 we completed the acquisition of terra industries inc terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products prior to the acquisition of terra our principal assets included 

• the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in north america donaldsonville louisiana 39

cf industries holdings inc 

• we paid cash dividends of 462 million and 194 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in cash dividends was due primarily to cash dividends of 200 million declared by terra prior to the april 5 2010 acquisition that were paid subsequent to the acquisition date and an increase in the number of common shares outstanding during 2010 compared to 2009 company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

we operated as a traditional supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock and listing on the new york stock exchange we sold approximately 474 million shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds of approximately 7154 million in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries inc now our whollyowned subsidiary were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and approximately 76 million shares of our common stock 

in april 2010 we acquired terra pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger for a total purchase price of 46 billion which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities a 75 interest in another nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility and certain joint venture interests 

significant items 

in april 2010 we completed the 46 billion acquisition of terra and it became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of cf holdings this acquisition made us a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer industry diversified our asset base and increased our geographic reach and operational efficiency as well as significantly increased our scale and capital market presence the financial results of the terra business are included in the consolidated results subsequent to the acquisition date consolidated net sales in 2010 were 40 billion up 52 as compared to 26 billion in 2009 due to the impact of the terra acquisition optimal weather conditions during both fertilizer application seasons and a favorable fertilizer environment due to strong farm economics while average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices declined by 11 in 2010 average phosphate fertilizer prices increased by 28 gross margin increased by 3401 million or 41 in 2010 to 11795 million the 2010 results include a 96 million 59 million after tax unrealized mark to market gain on natural gas derivatives results in 2010 also include 2198 million of net interest expense 1361 million after tax 1504 million 1488 million after tax of business combination expenses and peru project costs a 283 million gain 175 million after tax on the sale of terra common stock acquired during 2009 and 216 million 134 million after tax of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of terra 

cf industries holdings inc 

market conditions in 2009 were weaker than experienced in 2008 as lower demand for our products resulted from high industrywide inventories entering the year poor weather conditions and our customers hesitancy to restock due to an uncertain pricing environment pricing levels and raw material costs had reached unprecedented levels in 2008 but both declined in 2009 by late 2009 conditions had improved with expectations of a strong spring 2010 planting season and a tightening of the international supplydemand balance consolidated net sales in 2009 decreased by 13 billion or 33 to 26 billion with decreases due primarily to lower average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments this decrease was partially offset by potash sales and higher uan and phosphate export sales that we made in response to reduced domestic demand there were no potash sales in 2008 gross margin decreased by 3833 million to 8394 million in 2009 as the impact of lower average selling prices was partially mitigated by lower raw material costs and 875 million 540 million after tax of unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives results in 2009 include 534 million 449 million after tax of business combination expenses 359 million no tax impact of peru project costs and an 119 million gain 74 million after tax on the sale of terra common stock acquired during 2009 

during 2008 the nitrogen and phosphate segments experienced record high selling prices due to favorable supply and demand balances until the fourth quarter when sharply reduced fertilizer demand significantly impacted nitrogen and phosphate selling prices factors leading to reduced demand included poor weather in north america declining crop prices and reduced credit availability consolidated net sales increased by 11 billion or 42 to 39 billion in 2008 with increases due to higher average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments gross margin increased by 5527 million in 2008 our 2008 gross margin included a 638 million pretax 411 million after tax unrealized marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives in 2008 we began purchasing and storing potash fertilizer in our distribution network for sale in the spring season of 2009 the potash results are included in the phosphate segment during the fourth quarter we recorded a 570 million pretax 367 million after tax noncash charge to write down our phosphate 303 million and potash 267 million inventories as the carrying costs exceeded the estimated net realizable values 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we repurchased and retired 85 million shares of our common stock for approximately 500 million at an average price of 5896 per share under a program authorized by our board of directors 

key industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply  demand 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions 

cf industries holdings inc 

in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key consumingexporting countries such as china india or brazil often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs availability of raw materials government policies and global trade 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea uan and an because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses expenditures on natural gas comprised approximately 45 of the total cost of sales for our nitrogen fertilizer in 2010 and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization 

farmers economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns and the types of crops planted 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters recent changes in natural gas costs in north america relative to the rest of the world have made north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the middle east the former soviet union the republic of trinidad and tobago and venezuela are major exporters to north america 

the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer andor trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations 

political and social government policies 

the political and social policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports andor exports the subsidization of natural gas the subsidization of domestic producers andor the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the 

cf industries holdings inc 

construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives 

factors affecting our results 

net sales our net sales are derived from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis including under our forward pricing program fpp at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost using natural gas derivative instruments we report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward sales later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment volatility in quarterly reported earnings may arise from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of derivatives

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

consolidated operating results 

our total gross margin increased 3401 million or 41 to 11795 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 8394 million for 2009 due to increased gross margin in the nitrogen and phosphate segments in the nitrogen segment the gross margin increased by 2425 million to 10267 million for 2010 compared to 7842 million in 2009 due to the 3583 million contributed by the terra acquisition the positive impacts of terra lower realized natural gas costs and higher nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes were partially offset by lower average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices and lower unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in 2010 compared to the prior year in the phosphate segment gross margin increased by 976 million to 1528 million for 2010 compared to 552 million for 2009 due primarily to higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices in 2010 and losses on the sale of potash in 2009 partially offset by higher raw material and purchased product costs in 2010

net sales 

our net sales increased 52 to 40 billion in the year ended december 31 2010 from 26 billion in 2009 this 14 billion increase was due primarily to the inclusion of net sales of 14 billion related to our acquisition of terra higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices and higher nitrogen fertilizer sales volume were offset by lower average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices and lower phosphate segment sales volumes total sales volume increased 52 million tons or 65 in 2010 to 133 million tons as compared to 81 million tons in 2009 due to the terra acquisition in the nitrogen segment net sales increased 13 billion or 73 to 32 billion in the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 18 billion in 2009 due primarily to the acquisition of terra and higher nitrogen fertilizer sales volume partially offset by lower average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices decreased from 314 per ton in 2009 to 278 per ton in 2010 nitrogen segment sales volume in 2010 increased 56 million tons almost doubling from 2009 due to the acquisition of terra in the phosphate segment net sales increased 84 million to 7775 million in 2010 compared to 7691 million in 2009 due primarily to higher phosphate fertilizer selling prices which increased by 

cf industries holdings inc 

28 partially offset by lower phosphate segment sales volume phosphate segment sales volume in 2010 decreased by 17 from 2009 as no potash sales were made during 2010 and export sales volume declined we sold approximately 164000 tons of potash in 2009 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales in our nitrogen segment averaged approximately 189 per ton in 2010 compared to 180 per ton in 2009 this 5 increase was due primarily to lower unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in 2010 compared to the prior year period and higher depreciation and amortization associated with revaluing acquired assets partially offset by lower realized natural gas costs phosphate segment cost of sales averaged 335 per ton in 2010 compared to 317 per ton in the prior year an increase of 6 due primarily to higher raw material and purchased product costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 432 million to 1061 million in 2010 from 629 million in 2009 due primarily to the acquisition of terra

other operating—net 

net other operating expenses increased 700 million to 1667 million in 2010 compared to 967 million in 2009 this increase was due primarily to 1504 million of costs associated with our acquisition of terra including a 1230 million termination fee paid to yara international asa the cost of responding to agriums proposed acquisition of cf holdings and project development costs related to our proposed nitrogen complex in peru 

interest—net 

net interest expense was 2198 million in 2010 compared to 30 million of net interest income in 2009 the change was due primarily to interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior secured bridge facility senior secured term facility and senior notes interest expense includes 859 million of accelerated amortization of debt fees recognized upon repayment of the senior secured bridge loan and partial repayment of the senior secured term loan 

loss on extinguishment of debt

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders declined to 534 per share in 2010 from 742 per share in 2009 due primarily to the increase in diluted weighted average shares outstanding in april 2010 we issued 95 million shares of our common stock in conjunction with the terra acquisition and 129 million shares in the subsequent public offering 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

consolidated operating results 

our total gross margin decreased by 3833 million to 8394 million for 2009 from a gross margin of 12227 million for 2008 due mainly to lower phosphate segment results phosphate segment gross margins decreased 3972 million in 2009 to 552 million from 4524 million in 2008 primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower raw material costs nitrogen segment results improved slightly in 2009 with gross margins increasing 139 million to 7842 million from 7703 million in 2008 as realized natural gas costs unrealized marktomarket gains on our natural gas derivatives versus unrealized marktomarket losses in 2008 and lower purchased product costs contributed to the increase net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 3656 million for 2009 included 534 million 449 million after tax of costs associated with our acquisition of terra and the cost of responding to agriums proposed acquisition of cf holdings 359 million no tax impact of development costs related to our proposed project in peru a net pretax unrealized marktomarket gain of 875 million 540 million after tax on natural gas derivatives and an 119 million 74 million after tax gain on the sale of terra common stock net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 6846 million for 2008 included a pretax unrealized

net sales 

our net sales decreased 33 to 26 billion in 2009 from 39 billion in 2008 reflecting declines in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments our total sales volume increased to 81 million tons in 2009 from 79 million tons in 2008 in the nitrogen segment net sales decreased 7518 million to 18 billion in 2009 compared to 26 billion in 2008 due primarily to lower average selling prices average nitrogen selling prices for 2009 decreased 26 from record high selling prices in 2008 nitrogen sales volume in 2009 decreased 290000 tons or 5 to 59 million tons for 2009 compared to 61 million tons in 2008 in the phosphate segment net sales of 7691 million in 2009 were 42 lower than the 13 billion in 2008 due to lower average phosphate fertilizer selling prices partially offset by higher phosphate and potash sales volume our total level of phosphate segment sales volume was 22 million tons for 2009 compared to 18 million tons sold in 2008 we purchased and stored 164000 tons of potash in the second half of 2008 initiated sales in the second quarter and depleted our inventory later in 2009 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales in our nitrogen segment averaged 180 per ton for 2009 compared to 296 per ton in 2008 a decrease of 39 this decrease was due largely to lower realized natural gas costs unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives compared to unrealized losses in the prior year and lower purchased product costs the phosphate segment cost of sales averaged 317 per ton for 2009 compared to 491 per ton in the prior year a decrease of 35 this decrease was due mainly to lower sulfur and ammonia costs partially offset by the cost of potash fertilizer which was purchased at a higher average cost 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 7 to 629 million in 2009 compared to 680 million in 2008 this decrease was related primarily to a decrease in performancebased incentive compensation expense and lower longterm stockbased compensation expense 

other operating—net 

other operating—net increased 922 million to 967 million in 2009 from 45 million in 2008 this increase was due primarily to 534 million of costs associated with our proposals to acquire terra the cost of responding to agriums proposed acquisition of cf holdings and 359 million of development costs related to our proposed nitrogen complex in peru 

interest—net 

interest—net decreased 215 million to 30 million of net interest income in 2009 from 245 million of net interest income in 2008 due primarily to lower average interest rates 

other nonoperating—net 

other nonoperating income increased 121 million to 128 million in 2009 from 07 million in the prior year the increase was due primarily to an 119 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2009 on the sale of 20 million of our 70 million shares of terra common stock 

cf industries holdings inc

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest 

amounts reported as net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest represent the interest of the 34 holder of cfls common and preferred shares the decrease in 2009 was due to a decline in cfls operating results due to lower average selling prices for nitrogen fertilizers in canada 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders and weightedaverage common shares outstanding 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased to 742 per share for 2009 from 1213 per share for 2008 due primarily to the decrease in net earnings attributable to common stockholders partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of the share repurchase program that was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2008 the number of diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding decreased 72 million shares to 492 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 564 million for 2008

net sales nitrogen segment net sales increased 13 billion or 73 to 32 billion in 2010 compared to 18 billion in 2009 due primarily to the acquisition of terra and increased ammonia sales volume which was partially offset by lower average selling prices across nitrogen products nitrogen fertilizer sales volume in 2010 increased 56 million tons from 2009 due primarily to the acquisition of terra ammonia sales volume increased significantly during 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to the terra acquisition plus strong spring and fall application seasons due to favorable weather conditions and increased fourth quarter demand due to expectations of strong planted acres in 2011 urea and uan sales volume increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 due primarily to the acquisition of terra during 2009 we benefited from substantial forward sales volume that had been contracted at earlier dates and higher prices 

cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged approximately 189 per ton in 2010 compared to 180 per ton in 2009 the 5 increase was due primarily to lower unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in 2010 compared to the prior year period higher depreciation and amortization expense due to the terra acquisition and a greater percentage of sales volume in the form of ammonia partially offset by lower realized natural gas costs we recognized a 96 million unrealized marktomarket gain in 2010 compared to a net 875 million unrealized marktomarket gain in 2009 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

net sales nitrogen segment net sales decreased 29 to 18 billion in 2009 compared to 26 billion in 2008 due primarily to lower average selling prices for all nitrogen fertilizers average selling prices decreased in 2009 from record high prices in 2008 nitrogen sales volume decreased 5 to 59 million tons in 2009 compared to 61 million tons in 2008 due to lower uan sales volume ammonia and urea sales volume in 2009 approximated the volume in 2008 the 293000 ton decrease in uan sales volumes resulted primarily from weak domestic demand offset partially by an increase in export sales poor weather high downstream inventories entering the year and uncertainty about the 2010 application season contributed to the decline in domestic demand for uan weak domestic demand for uan was mitigated by taking advantage of export opportunities 

cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment decreased 42 to 180 per ton for 2009 compared to 296 per ton for 2008 due primarily to lower realized natural gas costs unrealized gains from marktomarket adjustments on natural gas derivatives in 2009 versus unrealized losses in 2008 and lower purchased product costs we recognized a net 875 million unrealized marktomarket gain in 2009 compared to a 638 million unrealized marktomarket loss in 2008 the overall weightedaverage cost of natural gas supplied to our donaldsonville facility and cfls medicine hat facility including realized gains and losses on derivatives decreased by 46 in 2009 versus the cost in 2008 the costs of finished products purchased for resale were approximately 1291 million lower in 2009 than in 2008 due to both lower prices and a lower volume of product purchased for resale

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

net sales phosphate segment net sales increased 84 million to 7775 million in 2010 from 7691 million in 2009 due to higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices partially offset by lower phosphate segment sales volume average phosphate fertilizer selling prices for 2010 increased by 28 compared to the prior year resulting from increased demand and tight international supplies our total volume of phosphate fertilizer sales of 19 million tons in 2010 was 10 lower than in 2009 due primarily to lower export sales and lower phosphate inventories available for sale the phosphate segment net sales included 164000 tons of potash in 2009 there were no potash sales in 2010 

cost of sales phosphate fertilizers cost of sales averaged 335 per ton in 2010 compared to 283 per ton in the prior year the 18 increase was due primarily to higher raw material costs for sulfur ammonia and phosphate rock produced at our mine 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

net sales phosphate segment net sales decreased 42 to 7691 million for 2009 compared to 13300 million in 2008 due primarily to lower average selling prices partially offset by higher sales volume average phosphate fertilizer selling prices during 2009 decreased 56 to 326 per ton from the record high levels in 2008 driven by lower domestic demand the decrease in domestic demand resulted from high downstream inventories tightness in the financial credit markets and customer resistance to price volatility our phosphate segment sales volume increased 26 to 22 million tons in 2009 compared to 18 million tons in 2008 primarily due to an increase in phosphate fertilizer export sales in response to lower domestic demand and the sale of 164000 tons of potash we had no potash sales in the year ended december 31 2008 

cost of sales phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged 283 per ton for 2009 a 40 decrease from 475 per ton in the prior year this decrease was due mainly to lower sulfur and ammonia costs sulfur costs decreased by more than 400 per long ton from the record high prices in 2008 resulting primarily from decreases in demand due to reductions in phosphate production the 56 roughly 300 per short ton decrease in ammonia costs also reflected a weaker international ammonia market 

inventory valuation reserves during 2009 we ceased sales of potash which were reported in the phosphate segment the gross margin on potash sales was a loss of 339 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 285 million in 2008 at december 31 2008 we recorded a 570 million noncash charge to write down our phosphate and potash inventories by 303 million and 267 million respectively as the carrying cost of the inventories exceeded the estimated net realizable values net realizable values for our phosphate and potash inventories are determined considering the fertilizer pricing environment at the time as well as our expectations of future price realizations the inventory that was held at december 31 2008 included inventory that was produced or purchased earlier when input costs and fertilizer prices were higher during the first quarter of 2009 we sold all of the higher cost phosphate inventory that existed at december 31 2008 throughout 2009 we reassessed the net realizable values of the inventory held based on this analysis no additional inventory valuation reserves were necessary for the phosphate fertilizer inventory however during the first and second quarters of 2009 additional inventory valuation reserves of 243 million and 50 million respectively were recognized related to the potash inventory during the third quarter we sold all remaining potash inventory see the critical accounting policies and estimates later in this discussion and analysis for additional information on our accounting policies related to inventory valuation

liquidity and capital resources 

generally our primary source of cash is cash from operations which includes customer advances our primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements investments and dividends our working capital requirements are affected by several factors including demand for our products selling prices for our products raw material costs freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business 

during 2010 our sources and uses of cash were impacted by our acquisition of terra in the second quarter of 2010 our main sources of cash to fund the acquisition were from the issuance of longterm debt and common stock during the second half of 2010 we used a significant portion of our cash generated by operations to repay a portion of our longterm debt that we issued in the second quarter of 2010 to finance the acquisition of terra see acquisition of terra industries inc and debt within this discussion and analysis 

under our shortterm investment policy we may invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us and canadian governments those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities 

cash balances 

as of december 31 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents of 7977 million shortterm investments of 31 million and a 4315 million current liability attributable to customer advances shortterm investments held at december 31 2010 consisted of a canadian treasury bill with an original maturity of twelve months as of december 31 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents of 6971 million shortterm investments of 1850 million and a 1595 million current liability attributable to customer advances shortterm investments held at december 31 2009 consisted of us treasury bills with original maturities between three and six months that are reported at fair value 

investments in auction rate securities 

as of december 31 2010 our investments in auction rate securities were reported at their fair value of 1028 million after reflecting a 76 million unrealized holding loss against a par value of 1104 million at december 31 2009 our investments in auction rate securities totaled 1339 million after reflecting a 45 million unrealized holding loss against a par value of 1384 million 

because the traditional auction process for auction rate securities generally has failed since early 2008 we do not consider our auction rate securities to be liquid investments we are not able to access these funds until such time as auctions for the securities succeed once again buyers are found outside the auction process andor the securities are redeemed by the issuers during 2010 280 million of auction rate securities were either sold or redeemed at par value outside of the auction process in accordance with our policies we review the underlying securities and assess the creditworthiness of these securities as part of our investment process in each case our reviews have continued to find these investments to be investment grade 

we determined the fair value of these investments at december 31 2010 using a marktomodel approach that relies on discounted cash flows market data and inputs derived from similar instruments the unrealized holding loss has been reported in other comprehensive income as the impairment is deemed to be temporary based on the requirements set forth in asc topic 320— investments—debt 

cf industries holdings inc 

and equity securities  see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our investments in auction rate securities 

the model we use to value our auction rate securities uses discounted cash flow calculations as one of the significant inputs to the ultimate determination of fair value the base interest rates assumed for the required rates of return are key components of the calculation of discounted cash flows if the required rate of return we used in the calculation model was 100 basis points higher the resulting holding loss would have been approximately 60 million greater we may need to recognize either additional holding gains or losses in other comprehensive income or holding losses in net earnings should changes occur in either the conditions in the credit markets the credit worthiness of the issuers or in the variables considered in our valuation model 

we believe ultimately we will recover the historical cost for these instruments as we presently intend to hold these securities until market liquidity returns either through resumption of auctions or otherwise we do not believe the ongoing market liquidity issues regarding these securities present any operating liquidity issues for us we believe our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments operating cash flow and credit available under our credit facility are adequate to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 

debt 

we entered into new financing arrangements to finance the acquisition of terra and pay related fees and expenses see acquisition of terra industries inc later in this section as of december 31 2010 we had 3460 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured term loan facility term loan facility and 16 billion of outstanding senior notes the term loan facility has a 5year maturity interest is charged based on one of two alternatives available to us both of which involve a base rate with a minimum level that may vary plus an applicable margin scheduled principal amortization on the term loan facility of 1 annually was satisfied through prepayments on the term loan during 2010 we repaid 15 billion on the term loan facility using proceeds from the senior notes issued as discussed below and cash generated from operations we are also required to repay the term loan annually to the extent of 50 of our excess cash flow as defined in the agreement our senior notes were issued in two series of 800 million each the first series carries an interest rate of 6875 and is due in the aggregate in 2018 the second series carries an interest rate of 7125 and is due in the aggregate in 2020 

in september 2009 terra commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for the 7 senior notes due 2017 2017 notes in october 2009 terra announced completion of the tender offer and received tenders from holders of approximately 3175 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 notes representing approximately 962 of the outstanding notes as of december 31 2010 130 million of the 2017 notes remain outstanding 

notes payable representing amounts owed by cfl to its noncontrolling interest holder with respect to advances were 49 million as of december 31 2010 compared to 47 million as of december 31 2009 

we have a senior secured revolving credit facility which provides for 500 million of borrowings outstanding at any time for working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes as of december 31 2010 4829 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility reflecting 171 million of outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings thereunder 

the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and term loan facility includes representations and warranties covenants and events of default including requirements that we 

cf industries holdings inc 

maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio as well as other customary covenants our senior notes indentures also include certain covenants and events of default as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement and the senior notes indentures 

see note 25 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our outstanding indebtedness 

acquisition of terra industries inc 

in april 2010 we completed the acquisition of terra through the merger of composite merger corporation composite with and into terra pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of march 12 2010 among cf holdings composite and terra the merger agreement as a result of the merger terra became an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of cf holdings the acquisition of terra made us a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer industry diversified our asset base and increased our geographic reach and operational efficiency as well as significantly increased our scale and capital market presence 

pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement each outstanding share of terra common stock was converted into the right to receive 3715 in cash and 00953 of a share of cf holdings common stock pursuant to an exchange offer the exchange offer and secondstep merger the merger all restricted stock under terras stock option plans and all other terra equitybased compensation awards whether vested or unvested as of april 5 2010 became fully vested and converted into the right to receive cash of 4593 per share on april 5 2010 following the initial expiration of the exchange offer we acquired approximately 79 of terras outstanding common stock and commenced a subsequent offering period to acquire the remaining shares of terra common stock the subsequent offering period expired april 14 2010 and on april 15 2010 we completed the merger in which composite merged with and into terra and terra became an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of cf holdings in the exchange offer and merger cf holdings issued an aggregate of 95 million shares of its common stock with a fair value of 882 million and paid an aggregate of 32 billion in cash net of cash acquired for 100 of terras common stock 

acquisition financing and subsequent equity and debt offerings 

we funded the cash requirements of the acquisition with cash on hand 175 billion of borrowings under a senior secured bridge facility and approximately 19 billion of borrowings under a senior secured term loan facility that provided for up to 20 billion of borrowings in connection with the terra acquisition 

on april 21 2010 cf holdings completed a public offering of approximately 129 million shares of common stock at 8900 per share the proceeds of 11 billion net of underwriting discounts and customary fees were used to repay a portion of the senior secured bridge facility 

on april 23 2010 cf industries inc completed a public offering of senior notes in an aggregate principle amount of 16 billion approximately 6452 million of the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay in full the remaining outstanding borrowings under the 175 billion senior secured bridge facility we used the remaining proceeds from the offering to repay approximately 8642 million of the senior secured term loan facility 

in may 2010 we redeemed terras 775 senior notes due 2019 for 7445 million and recognized a 17 million loss on the early extinguishment of this debt

terra results of operations 

following is the amount of net sales and earnings from the acquired terra businesses included in our results since april 5 2010 the results of the acquired terra businesses are included in the nitrogen segment 



included in the results from the acquired terra business was a onetime increase in cost of sales of 194 million related to the revaluation of terras inventories as of april 5 2010 that were sold in the second quarter of 2010 also included in terras results is additional depreciation and amortization resulting from the increased basis of the depreciable assets and the recognition of indentified finite lived intangible assets resulting from the purchase price allocation 

capital spending 

capital expenditures totaled 2581 million in 2010 and were made to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements the 224 million increase in capital expenditures in 2010 as compared to 2009 is due primarily to dam building expenditures at our hardee county florida phosphate rock mine we expect to spend approximately 300 million on routine capital expenditures in 2011 

forward sales 

we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis including under our forward pricing program fpp at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we generally lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by using natural gas derivative instruments and fixed price purchase contracts to hedge against price changes for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers as a result of using derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives and our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment unlike nitrogen fertilizer products sold under forward sales contracts for which we effectively fix the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials principally sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate costs as a result we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis 

cf industries holdings inc 

customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which may be several months after the order is placed as is the case for all of our sale transactions revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 we had approximately 4315 million and 1595 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets 

while customer advances were a significant source of liquidity in both 2010 and 2009 the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals the level of forward orders as of december 31 2010 may reflect our customers views of the current fertilizer pricing environment and expectations regarding future pricing and availability of supply 

under the fpp a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of an fpp contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales we may also be subject to storage charges under these arrangements should we be unable to deliver product at the specified time if the level of sales under the fpp were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase also borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity 

natural gas derivatives 

we use natural gas derivative instruments primarily to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on forward sales contracts our natural gas acquisition policy also allows us to establish derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our fpp 

natural gas derivatives involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts the counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions cash collateral is deposited with or received from counterparties when predetermined unrealized loss or gain thresholds are exceeded for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties individual credit limits monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements 

the master netting arrangements to our derivative instruments also contain creditriskrelated contingent features that require us to maintain minimum net worth levels and certain financial ratios if we fail to meet these minimum requirements the counterparties to derivative instruments for which we are in net liability positions could require daily cash settlement of unrealized losses or some other form of credit support 

as of december 31 2010 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position was 07 million we had 26 million of cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts as of december 31 2010

financial assurance requirements 

in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment we are subject to financial assurance requirements pursuant to the florida regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure and maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems we established an escrow account to meet such future obligations we made annual contributions of 37 million 75 million and 62 million in february of 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively to this escrow account which by rule is earmarked to cover the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack systems upon closure with the settlement of the plant city consent decree cd which is described below this escrow account only holds funds related to our closed bartow florida facility 

in the third quarter of 2010 we entered into a cd with the united states environmental protection agency and the florida department of environmental protection fdep with respect to our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex and its compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra we paid a penalty of approximately 700000 and agreed to modify certain operating practices and to undertake certain capital improvement projects including a modification to replace process water as a scrubbing medium at the ammonium phosphate fertilizer plants the cd also requires us to provide financial assurance beyond our obligations under florida law with respect to our ability to fund closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the plant city phosphogypsum stack system as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure 

initially in accordance with the cd we provided financial assurance by funding a separate trust although the required funding may be reduced if we meet certain financial metrics in the future in the fourth quarter of 2010 we deposited approximately 548 million into the trust and transferred approximately 269 million from our existing asset retirement obligation escrow account to the trust resulting in a total deposit of approximately 817 million this sum is fifty percent 50 of the currently estimated closure and long term care cost for the phosphogypsum stack system as estimated under the cd we must fund the remaining 50 of the estimated closure and long term care costs in 2011 and 2012 unless the funding obligation is reduced as noted above additional funding may be required in the future should the estimate of total closure and maintenance costs increase should the funding requirements for plant city as negotiated under the cd be lower than those as determined under current florida law we will be obligated to maintain the greater of the two amounts 

the amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements these expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the escrow and trust accounts which are based on the guidelines set forth in the cd and florida regulations ultimately the funds in these accounts will be used to fund the closure and maintenance of the phosphogypsum stack systems 

florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities we will also be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted the demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a cash deposit arrangement based on these current regulations we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in florida utilizing either of these methods

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

as a result of the terra acquisition we acquired operations in canada and interests in corporate joint ventures in the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us are recognized as the amounts are earned unless the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested based upon our current plans however the payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurs at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings can occur in different periods as of december 31 2010 we have recorded a deferred tax liability of 557 million which reflects the additional us and foreign income taxes which would be due upon the repatriation of approximately 5506 million of investment in its nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which is considered to not be permanently reinvested at that date the funding of these tax payments will be made with the cash repatriated from the foreign operations 

other liquidity requirements 

we are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations concerning surface and underground waters such regulations evolve through various stages of proposal or development and the ultimate outcome of such rulemaking activities often cannot be predicted prior to enactment at the present time proposed regulations in the state of florida are being considered to limit nutrient content in water discharges including certain specific regulations pertaining to water bodies near our florida operations we are monitoring the evolution of these proposed regulations potential costs associated with compliance cannot be determined currently and we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we contributed approximately 129 million to our pension plans in the year ended december 31 2010 we expect to contribute approximately 216 million to our pension plans in 2011 

cash flows 

operating activities 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

net cash generated from operating activities in 2010 was 11944 million as compared to 6818 million in 2009 the 5126 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the impact of the terra acquisition improved financial performance in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments and favorable working capital changes in the business in 2010 versus 2009 although the net earnings declined marginally between 2009 and 2010 that decline was more than explained by higher depreciation and amortization and an unfavorable change in the unrealized marktomarket adjustments on our natural gas derivatives both of which had no cash impact during 2010 depreciation depletion and amortization increased by 2938 million due primarily to the acquisition and stepup in value of the acquired terra assets and unrealized marktomarket gains in 2009 were not repeated in 2010 which reduced pretax earnings by 781 million as compared to 2009 the yearoveryear favorable impact on cash flow from operations due to working capital changes was primarily attributable to an increase in customer deposits in 2010 versus a decline in 2009 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

net cash generated from operating activities in 2009 was 6818 million compared to 6386 million in 2008 the 432 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was due primarily to 

cf industries holdings inc 

a 6643 million decline in cash invested in working capital primarily inventory partially offset by a decrease in net earnings the 6643 million decrease in cash invested in working capital of the business is the difference between the 2477 million decrease in 2009 and the 4166 million increase in 2008 the amount invested in working capital in 2009 declined due to a 4403 million decrease in inventories partially offset by a 1883 million decrease in customer advances total product inventories in the nitrogen and phosphate segments decreased by 1366 million and 2896 million respectively at december 31 2009 compared to december 31 2008 of the total decrease approximately 78 was due to lower quantities held and approximately 22 was due to lower perunit manufacturing costs the decreases related primarily to ammonia dap and potash fertilizer inventories the decrease in customer advances at december 31 2009 compared to december 31 2008 was due primarily to lower selling prices associated with orders under our fpp 

investing activities 

years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

net cash used in investing activities was 31 billion in 2010 compared to 4877 million used in 2009 the 26 billion increase in cash used in investing activities in 2010 was due primarily to the net cash consideration of 32 billion for the acquisition of terra partially offset by 2096 million of cash provided by net sales of shortterm investments and redemptions of auction rate securities and proceeds of 1671 million from the sale of terra industries inc common stock prior to the acquisition of terra compared to 1792 million of net purchases of terra industries inc common stock in 2009 the 6472 million increase in cash used in investing activities in 2009 was due primarily to net purchases of shortterm investments net purchases of terra common stock and higher capital expenditures net purchases in 2009 of shortterm investments was 1245 million and net purchases of terra common stock was 1792 million partially offset by a dividend of 524 million we received on the terra common stock the dividend was recognized as a return of capital additions to property plant and equipment accounted for 2581 million 2357 million and 1418 million of cash used in investing activities in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in additions to property plant and equipment in 2010 as compared to 2009 included a 169 million increase in capital projects and a 130 million increase in expenditures associated with dam building offset by a 75 million decrease in plant turnaroundrelated expenditures the increase in additions to property plant and equipment in 2009 was due primarily to a 709 million increase in capital projects and a 230 million increase in plant turnaroundrelated expenditures as previously discussed we made contributions of 585 million 75 million and 62 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively to our asset retirement obligation trust and escrow accounts the balance in these accounts is reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 

financing activities 

years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

net cash generated from financing activities was 20 billion in 2010 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 1239 million and 5405 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the 21 billion increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2010 was due primarily to 52 billion of proceeds from the issuance of debt and 12 billion from the issuance of common stock in a public offering associated with our acquisition of terra partially offset by 40 billion of prepayments on our debt and 02 billion of financing fees see the acquisition of terra industries inc section of this discussion and analysis for additional information the 4166 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to the expenditure of 5002 million to repurchase our common stock in the fourth quarter of 2008 distributions to the noncontrolling interest increased 596 million to 1123 million in 2009 from 527 million in 2008 due to cfls improved 2008 net

6 represents the minimum contractual commitment to keytrade for handling uan import and phosphate export transactions per the terms of a commercial agreement we have with keytrade 7 represents the contributions we expect to make to our pension plans during 2011 our pension funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum legal funding requirements plus discretionary amounts that we may deem to be appropriate 8 excludes 544 million of unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty in the timing of payments if any on these items see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these unrecognized tax benefits other longterm obligations 

as of december 31 2010 our other liabilities included balances related to asset retirement obligations aros and environmental remediation liabilities the estimated timing and amount of cash outflows associated with these liabilities are as follows 



1 represents the undiscounted inflationadjusted estimated cash outflows required to settle the recorded aros the corresponding present value of these future expenditures is 1198 million as of december 31 2010 excludes any amounts we may be required to deposit into our escrow or trust accounts to meet our financial assurance funding requirements see the discussion of our financial assurance requirements earlier in this section we also have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included is reclamation of land and effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2010 dollars is approximately 400 million we do not believe that there is a reasonable basis for currently estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities therefore the table above does not contain any payments for these aros see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our aros as described in financial assurance requirements we intend to set aside cash on an annual basis in escrow and trust accounts established to cover costs associated with closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems if necessary these accounts will be the source of a significant portion of the cash required to settle the aros pertaining to the phosphogypsum stack systems

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer and terminal and office leases the rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to ten years and the barge charter commitments currently have terms ranging from one to four years we also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements at several of our distribution locations some of which contain minimum throughput requirements the storage agreements contain minimum terms ranging from one to three years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party 

in 2006 we entered into a tenyear operating lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters located in deerfield illinois the deerfield corporate office lease agreement includes leasehold incentives rent holidays and scheduled rent increases that are expensed on a straightline basis our other operating lease agreements do not contain significant contingent rents leasehold incentives rent holidays scheduled rent increases concessions or unusual provisions see note 26 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning leases 

we do not have any other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are 

cf industries holdings inc 

billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation is computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction uop method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews 

scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher production costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line entitled additions to property plant and equipment 

inventory valuation 

we review our inventory balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our most recent estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation 

fixed costs writeoff 

fixed costs are considered as a part of normal product costs and included in inventory value provided that production is greater than 60 of total capacity if production volumes fall below 60 of capacity during the month the related overhead and other fixed costs are expensed in the period as incurred

asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation liabilities 

aros are legal obligations associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the bartow and plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complexes land reclamation activities at our hardee florida phosphate rock mine and the cessation of operations at all of our facilities if the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated aros are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service we are required to recognize an aro for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain the obligations related to closure reclamation and cessation of operations are capitalized at their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded the liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time the asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over the estimated useful life in the case of reclamation the asset is depreciated over the period the mining occurs which in some cases may be after initial recognition of the liability the aggregate carrying value of all of our aros was 1198 million as of december 31 2010 and 1037 million as of december 31 2009 the increase in the aggregate carrying value of these aros is due to normal accretion expense and recognizing changes in estimates offset by cash expenditures on aros 

environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts existing technology sitespecific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations in reporting environmental liabilities no offset is made for potential recoveries all liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur in accordance with gaap environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits changes in laws regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements the amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled 91 million as of december 31 2010 and 62 million as of december 31 2009 the increase in environmental remediation liabilities in 2010 compared to 2009 is due to the acquisition of terra 

the actual amounts to be spent on aros and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments and cost inflation as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes we are also required to select discount rates to calculate the present value of aros changes in these estimates or the selection of a different discount rate could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business 

the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable during 2010 no impairment occurred for

goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired we review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries annually to determine if there is a loss in value of the investment we determine the fair value of the investment using an income approach valuation method if the sum of the expected future discounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized immediately 

goodwill is evaluated in the fourth quarter for impairment at the reporting unit level in our case the nitrogen and phosphate segments there is a two step impairment test the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we use an income based valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit no goodwill impairment was identified in our 2010 review as of december 31 2010 we had 21 billion of goodwill resulting mainly from the terra acquisition 

fair value measurements 

we have classified our investments in auction rate securities as those measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 securities under the provisions of the current rules for assessing fair value see the liquidity and capital resources section of this discussion and analysis for detailed information concerning the critical accounting estimates involved in valuing and classifying these investments no other assets or liabilities are classified as level 3 items in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2010 see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning fair value measurements 

income taxes 

we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period when these changes occur 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively 

as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics 

cf industries holdings inc 

of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods 

in connection with our initial public offering ipo in august 2005 cf industries inc cfi ceased to be nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes and we entered into a net operating loss agreement nol agreement with cfis preipo owners relating to the future utilization of the preipo net operating loss carryforwards nols under the nol agreement if it is finally determined that the nols can be utilized to offset applicable postipo taxable income we will pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the utilization of nols 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 6812 million at december 31 2010 which was 848 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2010 pbo was computed based on a weighted average discount rate of 54 which was based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 446 million higher or 403 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussed the weighted average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2010 was 60 if the discount rate used to compute 2010 pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 19 million higher or 17 million lower respectively than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 66 weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2010 would have been 23 million lower or higher respectively see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our pension plans 

retiree medical benefits 

retiree medical benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions including discount rates used to compute the present value of the future obligations and expected increases in health care costs changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs affect the recorded amount of retiree medical benefits expense 

stockbased compensation 

costs associated with stockbased compensation are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations at the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards over the service period the fair value of nonqualified stock options granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes option valuation model key assumptions used in the blackscholes option valuation model include expected volatility and expected term the weightedaverage expected volatility used to value the stock 

cf industries holdings inc 

options granted in 2010 was 52 if the expected volatility was 2 higher or lower the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 3 higher or lower respectively the expected term of the stock options granted in 2010 was five years if the expected term was six months longer or shorter the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 4 higher or lower respectively 

we accrue the cost of stockbased awards on the straightline method over the applicable vesting period as a result total compensation cost recognized for 2010 on a pretax basis was 79 million as of december 31 2010 on a pretax basis there was approximately 95 million and 52 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonqualified options and restricted stock which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 21 and 20 years respectively see note 30 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of stockbased compensation 

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest as well as variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary our judgment in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our level of involvement in setting up the entity determining whether the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on our behalf determining whether we provide more than half the subordinated financial support to the entity and determining whether we absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses or returns 

we use the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies plus the amortization expense of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of purchase accounting our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions we regularly review our variable interest entities for potential changes in consolidation status 

we eliminate from our consolidated financial results all significant intercompany transactions 

recent accounting pronouncements

discussion of seasonality impacts on operations 

our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns

we are exposed to the impact of changes in the valuation of our investments interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

investments in auction rate securities 

as of december 31 2010 we had 1028 million of investments in auction rate securities consisting of availableforsale tax exempt auction rate securities that were all supported by student loans that were originated primarily under the federal family education loan program due to the illiquidity in the credit markets auctions for these securities have generally failed as a result we do not consider these investments to be liquid investments and we will not be able to access these funds until such time as auctions for these securities are successful buyers are found outside of the auction process andor the securities are redeemed by the issuer further details regarding these securities are included in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources both in this form 10k 

the valuation of these securities utilizes a marktomodel approach that relies on discounted cash flows market data and inputs that are derived from similar instruments based on this valuation the unrealized holding loss against the cost basis in the investments at december 31 2010 was 76 million the unrealized holding loss has been reported in other comprehensive income and the impact of the unrealized holding loss is recorded in the net 1028 million investment balance in auction rate securities if the required rate of return we used in the calculation model was 100 basis points higher the resulting holding loss would have been approximately 60 million higher we may need to recognize either additional holding gains or losses in other comprehensive income or holding losses in net earnings should changes occur in either the conditions in the credit markets the credit quality of the issuers or in the variables considered in our valuation model 

upon a failed auction the instrument carries an interest rate based upon certain predefined formulas a 100 basis point change in the average rate of interest earned on these investments would result in a 11 million change in pretax income on an annual basis 

interest rate fluctuations 

as of december 31 2010 we had 3460 million outstanding under our senior secured term loan facility that had an original maturity date of 5 years and a floating interest rate with a floor a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on our senior secured term loan would result in a 35 million decrease in pretax income on an annual basis the interest rate on our senior secured term loan facility is currently at its minimum rate we also had 8000 million of senior notes outstanding with an original maturity date of may 1 2018 and 8000 million of senior notes outstanding with an original maturity date of may 1 2020 the senior notes have fixed interest rates our senior secured revolving credit facility bears a current market rate of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on borrowings under the facility however as of december 31 2010 there were no borrowings under the facility the fair value of our longterm debt at december 31 2010 was approximately 21 billion 

we had notes payable of approximately 49 million as of december 31 2010 that had a floating interest rate a 100 basis point change in interest rates on our notes payable would result in a 49000 change in pretax income on an annual basis 

as of december 31 2010 we had shortterm investments of 31 million consisting primarily of an availableforsale canadian treasury bill with an original maturity date of twelve months a 100 basis 

cf industries holdings inc 

point change in the average rate of interest earned on these shortterm investments would result in a 31000 change in pretax income on an annual basis our advances to unconsolidated affiliates consisted of floating rate subordinated debt owed to us by keytrade totaling 124 million as of december 31 2010 a 100 basis point change in interest rates on this subordinated debt would result in 124000 change in pretax earnings on an annual basis 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we are exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the swiss franc at the present time we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to foreign currencies 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to fertilizer sales are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia urea and uan 32 by approximately 33 22 and 13 respectively 

we use natural gas in the manufacture of our nitrogen products natural gas prices are volatile we manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering periods not exceeding three years 

the derivative instruments that we use currently are natural gas swap contracts these contracts settle using nymex futures price indexes which represent fair value at any given time the contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods 

we account for derivatives under asc 815— derivatives and hedging  under this section derivatives are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and changes in their fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the normal purchase and sale exemption applies we use natural gas derivatives primarily as an economic hedge of gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting under asc 815 accordingly changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities 

as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 we had open derivative contracts for 518 million mmbtus and 110 million mmbtus respectively of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2010 we used derivatives to cover approximately 58 of our natural gas consumption an overall 100 per mmbtu change in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change the pretax unrealized marktomarket gainloss on these derivative positions by 518 million 

we purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of dap and map we attempt to include any price fluctuations related to these raw materials in our selling prices of finished products but there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered we enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices a 10 per ton change in the related cost of a ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change dap production cost by 210 per ton and 380 per ton respectively we also purchase ammonia urea uan dap and map to augment or replace production at our facilities

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

through the end of 2002 we operated as a traditional supply cooperative our focus was on providing our preipo owners with an assured supply of fertilizer typically over 80 of our annual sales volume was to our preipo owners though important financial performance was subordinate to our mandated supply objective 

in 2002 we adopted a new business model that established financial performance rather than assured supply to our preipo owners as our principal objective a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace we began to pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on financial performance one result of this approach was a substantial shift in our customer mix by 2009 our sales to customers other than our preipo owners and viterra our joint venture partner in cfl reached approximately 62 of our total sales volume for the year which was more than triple the comparable percentage for 2002 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering of common stock and listing on the new york stock exchange we sold approximately 474 million shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 7154 million we did not retain any of the proceeds from the ipo in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative in the reorganization transaction our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries inc now our whollyowned subsidiary were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and approximately 76 million shares of our common stock 

operating segments 

our business is divided into two operating segments the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment the nitrogen segment includes the manufacture and sale of ammonia urea and uan the phosphate segment includes the manufacture and sale of dap map and the sale of potash 

nitrogen segment 

we are one of the leading nitrogen fertilizer producers in north america our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia urea and uan our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the following table the sales shown do not reflect amounts used internally in the 

cf industries holdings inc 

manufacture of other products for example in 2009 we used about 22 million tons of ammonia in the production of urea and uan 



1 other nitrogen segment products include aqua ammonia 

gross margin for the nitrogen segment was 7842 million 7703 million and 4468 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

total assets for the nitrogen segment were 7127 million and 7582 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

we operate worldscale nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in donaldsonville louisiana and medicine hat alberta canada we own the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex and have a 66 economic interest in cfl a canadian variable interest entity that owns the medicine hat nitrogen fertilizer complex in 2009 the combined production capacity of these two facilities represented approximately 20 of north american ammonia capacity 33 of north american dry urea capacity and 18 of north american uan capacity 

the following table summarizes our nitrogen fertilizer production volume for the last three years at our facilities in donaldsonville louisiana and medicine hat alberta 



1 gross ammonia production including amounts subsequently upgraded onsite into granular urea andor uan 2 includes total production of the donaldsonville and medicine hat facilities including the 34 interest of viterra inc the noncontrolling interest holder in canadian fertilizers limited 

donaldsonville nitrogen complex 

the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex is the largest nitrogen fertilizer production facility in north america it has four worldscale ammonia plants four urea plants and two uan plants it has the annual capacity to produce approximately 23 million tons of ammonia most of which is typically upgraded into urea and uan 26 million tons of liquid urea including amounts upgraded into uan and 28 million tons of uan measured on a 28 nitrogen content basis with the uan plants 

cf industries holdings inc 

operating at capacity approximately 17 million tons of granular urea can be produced granular urea production can be increased to 2 million tons per year if uan production is reduced 

we believe that this facility is the most versatile nitrogen fertilizer production complex in north america with multiple production units for each product the complex has considerable flexibility to adjust its product mix donaldsonville is located near the mouth of the mississippi river and has three docks that can be used simultaneously under most river conditions in addition donaldsonville is located on the union pacific railroad and a 2000mile ammonia pipeline providing us with flexible and competitively priced transportation to our inmarket nitrogen fertilizer terminals and warehouses by rail and pipeline as well as by barge the facility is capable of docking loading and unloading oceangoing ships providing us with direct access to global customers and suppliers the complex has onsite storage for 70000 tons of ammonia 135000 tons of uan measured on a 28 nitrogen content basis and 83000 tons of granular urea providing us with flexibility to handle temporary disruptions to shipping activities without impacting production and also flexibility to purchase and store liquid product for resale 

medicine hat nitrogen complex 

medicine hat is the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in canada it has two worldscale ammonia plants that have a combined gross annual production capacity of approximately 13 million tons and a worldscale urea plant that has a gross annual production capacity of 810000 tons the complex has onsite storage for 60000 tons of ammonia and 70000 tons of urea providing flexibility to handle temporary disruptions of outbound shipments 

the medicine hat facility is owned by cfl we own 49 of the voting common stock of cfl and 66 of cfls nonvoting preferred stock viterra inc viterra owns 34 of the voting common stock and nonvoting preferred stock of cfl the remaining 17 of the voting common stock of cfl is owned by growmark inc growmark and la coop fédérée we designate four members of cfls ninemember board of directors viterra designates three members and growmark and la coop fédérée each designate one member cfl is a consolidated variable interest entity in our financial statements 

we operate the medicine hat facility and purchase approximately 66 of the facilitys ammonia and urea production pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either cf industries inc or cfl upon a twelvemonth notice viterra has the right but not the obligation to purchase the remaining 34 of the facilitys ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement to the extent that viterra does not purchase its 34 of the facilitys production we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts since 1995 however viterra or its predecessor has purchased at least 34 of the facilitys production each year 

under the product purchase agreements both we and viterra pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases however the product purchase agreements also provide that cfl will distribute its net earnings to viterra and us annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from cfl our product purchase agreement also requires us to advance funds to cfl in the event that cfl is unable to meet its debts as they become due the amount of each advance would be at least 66 of the deficiency and would be more in any year in which we purchased more than 66 of medicine hats production a similar obligation also exists for viterra we and viterra currently manage cfl such that each party is responsible for its share of cfls fixed costs and cfls production volume is managed to meet the parties combined requirements the management 

cf industries holdings inc 

agreement the product purchase agreements and any other agreements related to cfl are subject to change with the consent of both parties 

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material as well as the primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at both the donaldsonville and the medicine hat facilities in 2009 our natural gas purchases accounted for approximately 52 of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization donaldsonville is located in close proximity to one of the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america known as the henry hub medicine hat is located in close proximity to one of the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in canada known as aeco 

we use a combination of spot and term purchases of varied duration from a variety of suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced natural gas supply in addition we use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices 

in 2009 the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex consumed approximately 76 million mmbtus of natural gas the facility has access to five natural gas pipelines and obtains gas from several suppliers in 2009 the largest individual supplier provided approximately 56 of the donaldsonville facilitys total gas requirement the medicine hat complex consumed approximately 36 million mmbtus of natural gas in 2009 the facility has access to two natural gas pipelines and obtains gas from numerous suppliers the largest of which supplied approximately 37 of the gas consumed in 2009 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex which is located on the mississippi river includes a deepwater docking facility access to an ammonia pipeline and truck and railroad loading capabilities we ship our share of ammonia and urea produced at the medicine hat nitrogen fertilizer complex by truck and rail to customers in the united states and canada and to our storage facilities in the northern united states 

ammonia urea and uan from donaldsonville can be loaded into river barges and oceangoing vessels for direct shipment to domestic customers for transport to storage facilities or for export we own six ammonia river barges with a total capacity of approximately 16400 tons we contract on a dedicated basis for tug services and the operation of these barges we have 16 uan river barges contracted on a dedicated basis with a total capacity of approximately 48000 tons we contract for additional ammonia and uan barge capacity as needed river transportation for urea is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators 

the donaldsonville facility is connected to a 2000mile long ammonia pipeline used by several nitrogen producers to transport ammonia to over 20 terminals and shipping points located in the midwestern us corn belt we are a major customer of this ammonia pipeline in 2009 approximately 46 of our ammonia shipments from our donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex were transported via the ammonia pipeline 

we also transport substantial volumes of urea and uan from the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex and ammonia and urea from the medicine hat nitrogen fertilizer complex by rail in addition to using rail cars provided by the rail carriers as of december 31 2009 we had leases for approximately 600 ammonia tank cars 900 uan tank cars and 600 dry product hopper cars

phosphate segment 

we are a major manufacturer of phosphate fertilizer products our main phosphate fertilizer products are dap and map we also sold potash fertilizer in 2009 but have ceased sales of this product potash results are included in the phosphate segment 

our historical sales of phosphate fertilizer products are shown in the table below 



gross margin for the phosphate segment was 552 million 4524 million and 2232 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

total assets for the phosphate segment were 5641 million and 7641 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

our phosphate fertilizer manufacturing operations are located in central florida and consist of a phosphate fertilizer chemical complex in plant city a phosphate rock mine a beneficiation plant and phosphate rock reserves in hardee county and a deepwater terminal facility in the port of tampa we own each of these facilities and properties 

the following table summarizes our phosphate fertilizer production volumes for the last three years and current production capacities for phosphaterelated products

hardee county phosphate rock mine 

in 1975 we purchased 20000 acres of land in hardee county florida that was originally estimated to contain in excess of 100 million tons of recoverable rock reserves between 1978 and mid1993 we operated a one million ton per year phosphate rock mine on a 5000acre portion of these reserves 

cf industries holdings inc 

in 1992 we initiated a project to expand and relocate mining operations to the remaining 15000acre area of the reserve property this phosphate rock mine cost 135 million and began operations in late 1995 in 1997 we added approximately 20 million tons to our reserve base through an exchange with a neighboring rock producer in 1999 we acquired 1400 acres of land containing an estimated 8 million tons of rock reserves in 2008 we acquired approximately 800 acres of land containing an estimated 16 million tons of rock reserves and in 2009 we acquired approximately 175 acres of land containing an estimated 14 million tons of rock reserves 

the table below shows the estimated reserves at the hardee phosphate complex as of december 31 2009 also reflected in the table is the grade of the reserves expressed as a percentage of bone phosphate of lime bpl and p 2 o 5  finally the table also reflects the average values of the following material contaminants contained in the reserves ferrous oxide fe 2 o 3  plus aluminum oxide al 2 o 3  and magnesium oxide mgo

phosphate raw materials 

phosphate rock supply phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers approximately 35 tons of phosphate rock are needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5 the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex typically consumes in excess of three million tons of rock annually as of december 31 2009 our hardee rock mine had approximately 13 years of fully permitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our hardee property where we can mine the expanded area has an estimated 34 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves we estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately ten additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area 

sulfur supply sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid approximately threequarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5  our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 800000 long tons of sulfur annually when operating at capacity we obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration in 2009 martin sulphur our largest molten sulfur supplier supplied approximately 60 of the molten sulfur used at plant city 

ammonia supply dap and map have a nitrogen content of 18 and 11 respectively and a phosphate nutrient content of 46 and 52 respectively ammonia is the primary source of nitrogen in dap and map operating at capacity our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex consumes approximately 400000 tons of ammonia annually 

the ammonia used at our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia storage facility located in tampa florida this facility consists of a 38000ton ammonia storage tank access to a deepwater dock that is capable of discharging oceangoing vessels and rail and truck loading facilities in addition to supplying our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex our tampa ammonia distribution system has the capacity to support ammonia sales to and distribution services for other customers sales of ammonia from our tampa terminal are reported in our nitrogen business segment the ammonia supply for tampa is purchased from offshore sources providing us with access to the broad international ammonia market 

phosphate distribution 

we operate a phosphate fertilizer warehouse located at a deepwater port facility in tampa florida most of the phosphate fertilizer produced at plant city is shipped by truck or rail to our tampa warehouse where it is loaded onto vessels for shipment to export customers or for transport across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river in 2009 our tampa warehouse handled approximately 13 million tons of phosphate fertilizers or about 72 of our production the remainder of our phosphate fertilizer production is transported by truck or rail directly to customers or to inmarket storage facilities 

phosphate fertilizer shipped across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river is transferred into river barges near new orleans phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is transported to our storage facilities or delivered directly to customers river transportation is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators

competition 

our markets are intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

in our nitrogen segment our primary north americanbased competitors are agrium koch nitrogen and terra industries there is also significant competition from product sourced from regions of the world with lower natural gas costs because urea is a widelytraded fertilizer product and there are limited barriers to entry competition from foreignsourced product is particularly acute with respect to urea 

in our phosphate segment our primary north americanbased competitors are agrium mosaic potash corp and simplot historically imports have not been a significant factor as the united states is a large net exporter of phosphate fertilizers 

seasonality 

the sales patterns of all five of our major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

financial information about foreign and domestic sales and operations 

the amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying value of our foreign and domestic assets are set forth in note 32—segment disclosures 

environment health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes violations can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment 

we have received notices from time to time from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws we are currently involved in remediation activities at certain of our current and former facilities we are also participating in the cleanup of thirdparty sites at which we 

cf industries holdings inc 

have disposed of wastes in 2002 we were asked by the current owner of a former phosphate mine and processing facility that we may have operated in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho to contribute to a remediation of this property we declined to participate in the cleanup in 2009 we were again asked by the current owner to participate in the remediation of the property it is our understanding that the current owner signed a consent judgment with the idaho department of environmental quality ideq for cleanup of the processing facility portion of the site and has submitted a draft remedial action plan that is under review by the ideq and related agencies we anticipate that the current owner might bring a lawsuit against us seeking contribution for the cleanup costs although we do not have sufficient information to determine when such a suit may be brought we are not able to estimate at this time our potential liability if any with respect to the remediation of this property based on currently available information we do not expect that any remedial or financial obligations we may be subject to involving this or other sites will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

environmental health and safety expenditures 

our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2009 were approximately 68 million in 2010 we estimate that we will spend approximately 10 million for environmental health and safety capital expenditures environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

rcra enforcement initiative 

in december 2004 and january 2005 the united states environmental protection agency epa inspected our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex to evaluate the facilitys compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the federal statute that governs the generation transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous wastes this inspection was undertaken as a part of a broad enforcement initiative commenced by the epa to evaluate whether mineral processing and mining facilities including in particular all wet process phosphoric acid production facilities are in compliance with rcra and the extent to which such facilities waste management practices have impacted the environment 

by letter dated september 27 2005 epa region 4 issued to the company a notice of violation nov and compliance evaluation inspection report the nov and compliance evaluation inspection report alleged a number of violations of rcra including violations relating to recordkeeping the failure to properly make hazardous waste determinations as required by rcra and alleged treatment of sulfuric acid waste without a permit the most significant allegation in the nov is that the plant city facilitys reuse of phosphoric acid process water which is otherwise exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste in the production of ammoniated phosphate fertilizer and the return of this process water to the facilitys process water recirculating system have resulted in the disposal of hazardous waste into the system without a permit the compliance evaluation inspection report indicates that as a result the entire process water system including all pipes ditches cooling ponds and gypsum stacks could be regulated as hazardous waste management units under rcra 

several of the companys competitors have received novs making this same allegation this particular recycling of process water is common in the industry and the company believes was authorized by the epa in 1990 the company also believes that this allegation is inconsistent with recent case law governing the scope of the epas regulatory authority under rcra nonetheless the 

cf industries holdings inc 

company has conducted a successful pilot test to replace process water as a scrubbing medium at the ammonium phosphate fertilizer plants and maintain compliance with plant citys air permit the company has received a permit from the florida department of environmental protection that authorizes the company to make this change for the three ammonium phosphate plants that utilize process water although this does not fully resolve the nov or address all of the issues identified by the epa and the united states department of justice doj this does address a significant issue identified in the nov 

the nov indicated that the company is liable for penalties up to the statutory maximum for example the statutory maximum per day of noncompliance for each violation that occurred after march 15 2004 is 32500 per day although penalties of this magnitude are rarely if ever imposed the company is at risk of incurring substantial civil penalties with respect to these allegations the epa has referred this matter to the doj for enforcement the company is currently in negotiations with the doj that have included not only the issues identified in the nov but other operational practices of the company and its competitors a final settlement may include the requirement for the company to meet specified financial tests andor contribute cash or other qualifying assets into a trust designated to be used for the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack systems upon closure the company does not know if this matter will be resolved prior to the commencement of litigation by the united states 

legislation and regulation of greenhouse gasses 

there have been increased initiatives by various parties to legislate andor regulate carbon emissions including carbon dioxide the companys nitrogen operations produce substantial quantities of carbon dioxide in the chemical reactions that are necessary to produce anhydrous ammonia 

pursuant to the kyoto protocol canada has committed to reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the us it is possible that ghg emissions will be limited through federal legislation andor regulatory action in june 2009 the american clean energy and security act was passed by the us house of representatives this legislation would establish an economywide cap and trade system for carbon emissions commencing in 2012 emitters of ghgs would be required to have allowances to offset their ghg emissions and over time the cap on aggregate ghg emissions would decline similar legislation was introduced in the us senate in september 2009 at this time we cannot predict whether legislation imposing limits on ghg emissions in the us will be enacted 

the environmental protection agencys epa new greenhouse gas mandatory reporting rule requires our facilities in donaldsonville louisiana and plant city florida to monitor emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition to the ghg reporting rule which directly affects our facilities the epa has issued or proposed other regulations which could eventually impact us including potentially applying the clean air act to regulate ghgs 

neither of the state governments in florida nor louisiana where our us production facilities are located has proposed regulations on ghg emissions however coalitions of states in the northeast midwest and west are working together to develop regional ghg emission reduction programs and several states the most noteworthy being california are developing regulatory programs on their own 

federal andor state regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our operating results in 

cf industries holdings inc 

addition to the extent climate change restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate are less stringent than in the us or canada our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us 

regulatory permits and approvals 

we hold numerous environmental and mining permits authorizing operations at our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals 

as of december 31 2009 the area permitted for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 46 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current production rates for approximately 13 years we have secured the necessary permits to mine these reserves from the florida department of environmental protection and the us army corps of engineers we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated additional 34 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately ten additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area the estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective of the anticipated permittable mining areas based on recent similar permitting efforts in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

likewise our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2014 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits we have secured the local development authorization to increase the capacity of this stack system based on this authorization estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately eight years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in certain cases as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities we currently utilize an escrow account established for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection as a means of complying with floridas regulations governing financial assurance requirements for the closure of phosphogypsum stacks for additional information on the cash deposit arrangement see note 13—asset retirement obligations 

several of our permits including our mining permit at the hardee phosphate complex require us to reclaim any property disturbed by our operations at our hardee property we currently mine approximately 300 to 400 acres of land each year all of which must be reclaimed the costs to reclaim this land vary based on the type of land involved and range from 3600 to 18000 an acre with an

average of 8300 an acre for additional information on our hardee asset retirement obligations see note 13—asset retirement obligations 

our phosphate operations in florida are subject to regulations governing the closure and longterm maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at our bartow phosphate complex we estimate that we will spend a total of approximately 7 million between 2010 and 2017 to complete closure of the cooling pond and channels water treating expenditures at bartow are estimated to require about 13 million over the next 47 years postclosure longterm care expenditures at bartow are estimated to total approximately 61 million for a 58 year period including 2010 to close the phosphogypsum stack currently in use at the plant city phosphate complex we estimate that we will spend approximately 67 million during the years 2033 through 2037 and another 46 million in 2087 to close the cooling pond water treating expenditures at plant city are estimated to approximate 6 million in 2018 65 million in 2033 through 2037 and 169 million thereafter through 2087 postclosure longterm care expenditures at plant city are estimated to total 108 million for a 50 year period commencing in 2038 these amounts are in nominal dollars using an assumed inflation rate of 3 for additional information on our asset retirement obligations related to our phosphogypsum stack systems see note 13—asset retirement obligations 

cost estimates for closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems are based on formal closure plans submitted to the state of florida which are subject to revision during negotiations over the next several years moreover the time frame involved in the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems extends as far as the year 2087 accordingly the actual amount to be spent also will depend upon factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation and changes in applicable laws and regulations these cost estimates may also increase if the plant city phosphogypsum stack is expanded further for additional information on our plant city asset retirement obligations see note 13—asset retirement obligations

 item 1a risk factors 

  our business is subject to a number of risks if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is dependent on natural gas which can be relatively expensive in north america and is subject to a high level of price volatility 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea and uan because all of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses expenditures on natural gas comprised approximately 52 of the total cost of our nitrogen fertilizer sales in 2009 and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization 

the market price for natural gas in north america is higher than the price of natural gas in certain other major fertilizerproducing regions a number of our competitors benefit from access to lowerpriced natural gas through manufacturing facilities or interests in manufacturing facilities located in these regions or other regions with abundant supplies of natural gas many of these facilities are exportoriented and their owners actively ship product to north america which is our primary market for nitrogen based fertilizers 

the price of natural gas in north america is highly volatile during 2009 the median daily price at henry hub exceeded 560 per mmbtu at the beginning of the year then reached a low of 185 per mmbtu on september 5 2009 and returned to a high of 600 per mmbtu on december 30 2009 the volatility of the price of natural gas in north america compounds our disadvantage to some of our competitors in addition to having access to lowerpriced natural gas these competitors may also benefit from fixedprice natural gas contracts some of which may be linked directly to the market price of the nitrogen fertilizer being manufactured given the volatility of pricing and our dependence on north american natural gas the price we pay for natural gas in the future may be higher than certain other fertilizerproducing regions of the world which may make it more difficult for us to compete against these producers we may not be able to pass along the resulting higher operating costs to our customers in the form of higher product prices if market prices are below our cost of production due to the high cost of natural gas we may shift our sourcing of nitrogen fertilizers from manufactured to purchased products during late 2005 and early 2006 we curtailed production of fertilizers at our donaldsonville complex for this reason 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our results of operations tend to be negatively impacted 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by population growth changes in dietary habits nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels and planted acreage and application rates among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade 

periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in new plant investment and increased production causing supply to exceed demand and prices and 

cf industries holdings inc 

capacity utilization to decline in particular new capacity is expected to be added abroad in lowcost regions future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to alleviate any existing or future conditions of excess industry capacity 

during periods of industry oversupply our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory lower production of our products andor plant closures 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities 

consolidation in the fertilizer industry has increased the resources of several of our competitors and we expect consolidation among fertilizer producers to continue in light of this industry consolidation our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships in the future we may not be able to find suitable assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities we may not be able to acquire desired assets or enter into desired joint ventures or partnerships on economically acceptable terms any potential inability to compete successfully could result in the loss of customers which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

china is the worlds largest producer and consumer of fertilizers and is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

a decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products 

conditions in the us agricultural industry can significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices the domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products 

state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications for example in recent years ethanol production in the us has increased significantly due in part to federal legislation mandating greater use of renewable fuels this increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the us and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuels standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a growing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to reduce subsidies for ethanol allow increased ethanol imports and adopt temporary waivers to the 

cf industries holdings inc 

current rfs levels any of which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition several states are currently considering limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products and increase the cost of natural gas 

weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers 

weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts can also dramatically affect the price of natural gas colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the natural gas demand for residential use also hurricanes affecting the gulf coastal states can severely impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise sharply 

our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including credit risk and increasing government regulation 

in order to manage financial exposure to commodity price and market fluctuations we utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen based fertilizers as a result we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions the credit and economic crisis that started in 2008 impacted a number of financial institutions some of which participate as counterparties to our natural gas swaps we monitor the swap portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with any one counterparty as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties established credit limits cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on derivative settlements 

the natural gas derivatives that we currently use are overthecounter otc swap contracts federal legislation is under consideration that could add substantial regulation to derivatives markets with emphasis on otc derivatives some of the most stringent legislation proposed would require most market participants to utilize a formal exchange for these transactions utilizing a formal exchange requires gains or losses on derivatives to be settled daily with the exchange transacting derivatives overthecounter rather than through an exchange enables us to take advantage of favorable credit lines provided by our counterparties through these credit lines we are not required to post collateral on our derivatives unless their value surpasses an established threshold the combined credit lines extended to us by our counterparties with which we have open derivative contracts currently exceed 100 million if we were forced to utilize an exchange the cost of utilizing derivatives could increase which would adversely affect our cost of operations and could negatively impact our liquidity

our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

if seasonal demand exceeds our projections our customers may acquire products from our competitors and our profitability will be negatively impacted if seasonal demand is less than we expect we will be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively impacted by any related storage costs andor liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are particularly acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the highly volatile cost of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers 

our customer base is concentrated with certain large customers accounting for a substantial portion of our sales 

during 2009 three customers chs inc growmark inc and gavilon fertilizer llc made combined fertilizer purchases of approximately 1121 million from us representing approximately 43 of our total net sales we have entered into a multiyear supply contract with chs inc that expires on june 30 2010 and contracts with growmark inc and gavilon fertilizer llc that both expire on june 30 2013 chs inc has informed us they do not intend to renew the multiyear supply contract upon its expiration since becoming a public company in 2005 we have diversified our customer base however we continue to depend on these three customers for a significant portion of our sales and may have less flexibility than some of our competitors to seek profitable sales to other customers a substantial change in purchasing decisions by any or all of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a change in the use of the forward pricing program by our customers could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our operating results liquidity and financial condition 

in mid2003 we implemented a forward pricing program fpp through our fpp we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose this improves our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product allows us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing assets 

as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we generally use natural gas derivatives or fixed price fertilizer purchase contracts to hedge against changes in the price of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our supply cost fixing the selling prices of our products under our fpp often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins 

cf industries holdings inc 

available at the time of shipment additionally the use of derivatives to lock in the majority of our margins on fpp sales of nitrogen products can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives prior to the purchase of the natural gas 

under our fpp customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and generally pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date thereby significantly increasing our liquidity any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with the fpp are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months or more as of december 31 2009 and 2008 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders under the fpp equaled approximately 18 and 56 respectively of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

we believe the fpp is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers under the fpp may result in lower profit margins than if we had not used the fpp conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers under the fpp may result in higher profit margins than if we had not used the fpp 

the fpp is less effective at reducing our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins in circumstances where we purchase the fertilizer product from third parties for resale rather than manufacture the product at one of our facilities for example during periods of high natural gas costs we may decide to curtail production at our facilities and increase our purchases of fertilizer products originating from offshore lower cost producers for resale to our customers because it is generally not feasible to purchase fertilizer products from these third parties on a forward basis or match purchased quantities with specific order quantities we may not be able to fix our profit margins effectively on fertilizer products that we buy for resale under our fpp one method we use to reduce our margin exposure on sales of purchased products under the program is to purchase the required fertilizer products in advance of the specified delivery date however in such circumstances we may be required to buy and store the product sooner and in greater quantities than if produced thereby reducing the liquidity benefits otherwise associated with the fpp it also may not be feasible to purchase sufficient quantities of fertilizer in advance of the specified delivery dates at known acceptable prices an increase in our purchases of fertilizer products for resale to our customers may increase our exposure to fluctuating profit margins on the purchased products and could have a material adverse affect on our operating results liquidity and financial condition 

we also sell phosphate products through our fpp in 2009 forward sales of phosphate fertilizer products represented approximately 14 of our phosphate fertilizer volume compared to 61 of our phosphate fertilizer volume in 2008 similar to nitrogen sales phosphate sales under the fpp increased significantly in both 2007 and the first half of 2008 during a period of rapidly rising fertilizer prices however fpp sales decreased in 2009 when prices declined from their high in late 2008 unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products where we have the opportunity to fix the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate fertilizer costs as a result we are typically exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis

our operations are reliant on a limited number of key facilities that involve significant risks and hazards against which we may not be fully insured 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and they may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities for example over the course of the past few years we have been involved in numerous property damage and personal injury lawsuits arising out of a hydrogen explosion at our donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex in 2000 in which three people died and several others were injured in 2009 two independent truck drivers died as a result of the release of anhydrous ammonia during loading operations at our ammonia terminal in rosemount minnesota 

our exposure to these types of risks is increased because of our reliance on a limited number of key facilities our nitrogen fertilizer operations are dependent on our nitrogen fertilizer complex in donaldsonville louisiana and our joint ventures nitrogen fertilizer complex in medicine hat alberta our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on our phosphate mine and associated beneficiation plant in hardee county florida our phosphate fertilizer complex in plant city florida and our ammonia terminal in tampa florida any suspension of operations at any of these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments under our forward pricing program and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition all of these facilities other than the complex in medicine hat are located in regions of the united states that experience a relatively high level of hurricane activity such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas and sulfur in the gulf region 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we are subject to various selfretentions and deductibles under these insurance policies as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 

we rely on third party providers of transportation services and equipment which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations 

we rely on railroad trucking pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars from rail car owners in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including extreme weather conditions work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards 

cf industries holdings inc 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of our raw materials or finished products 

if we are delayed or are unable to ship our finished products or obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our sales revenues andor cost of operations could be adversely affected 

the railroad industry has initiated various efforts to limit the railroads potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities these efforts by the railroads include i requesting that the surface transportation board stb issue a policy statement finding that it is reasonable for a railroad to require a shipper to indemnify the railroads and carry insurance for all liability above a certain amount arising from the transportation of tih materials ii requesting that the stb approve an increase in the maximum reasonable rates that a railroad can charge for the transportation of tih materials and iii lobbying for new legislation or regulations that would limit or eliminate the railroads common carrier obligation to transport tih materials if the railroads were to succeed in one or more of these initiatives it could substantially and adversely affect our cost and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads 

new regulations could also be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products the us railroad industry is also proposing higher ammonia tank car performance standards which could require the modification or replacement of our leased tank car fleet these higher standards could adversely impact our cost of operations and our ability to obtain an adequate supply of rail cars to support our operations 

we are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventures 

we participate in joint ventures with third parties including cfl and keytrade our joint venture partners may have shared or majority control over the operations of our joint ventures as a result our investments in joint ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our joint ventures or our partners have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions requests policies or objectives subject the joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business 

in addition we may become involved in disputes with our joint venture partners which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

expansion of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both domestically and in certain foreign locations acquisitions partnerships joint ventures and other major investments require significant managerial resources which may be diverted from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses 

cf industries holdings inc 

international acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures or the international expansion of our business involve additional risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs of complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments political and economic instability including the possibility for civil unrest nationalization of properties by foreign governments tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and foreign currencies 

furthermore acquisitions of businesses or facilities entail a number of additional risks including potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management problems with effective integration of operations the inability to maintain key preacquisition business relationships loss of key personnel of businesses we acquire or invest in exposure to unanticipated liabilities difficulties in realizing efficiencies synergies and cost savings and challenges arising from the increased scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 

these risks of unanticipated adverse consequences from any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented we also face increased exposure to risks related to acquisitions and international operations because our experience with acquisitions and international operations is limited as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other investments 

consolidation in the fertilizer industry has increased the resources of several of our competitors and we expect consolidation among fertilizer producers to continue in light of this industry consolidation our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships in the future we may not be able to find suitable assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities we may not be able to acquire desired assets or enter into desired joint ventures or partnerships on economically acceptable terms our inability to compete successfully could result in the loss of customers which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions or other environmental discharges in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our operating results 

there have been increased initiatives by various parties to legislate andor regulate carbon emissions including carbon dioxide the companys nitrogen operations produce substantial quantities of carbon dioxide in the chemical reactions that are necessary to produce anhydrous ammonia 

pursuant to the kyoto protocol canada has committed to reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the us it is possible that ghg emissions will be limited through federal legislation andor regulatory action in june 2009 the american clean energy and security act was passed by the us house of representatives this legislation would establish an economywide cap and trade system for carbon emissions commencing in 2012 emitters of ghgs would be required to have allowances to offset their ghg emissions and over time the cap on aggregate ghg emissions would decline similar legislation was introduced in the us senate in september 2009 at this time we cannot predict whether legislation imposing limits on ghg emissions in the us will be enacted 

the environmental protection agencys epa new greenhouse gas mandatory reporting rule requires our facilities in donaldsonville louisiana and plant city florida to monitor emissions 

cf industries holdings inc 

beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition to the ghg reporting rule which directly affects our facilities the epa has issued or proposed other regulations which could eventually impact us including potentially applying the clean air act to regulate ghgs 

neither of the state governments in florida nor louisiana where our us production facilities are located has proposed regulations on ghg emissions however coalitions of states in the northeast midwest and west are working together to develop regional ghg emission reduction programs and several states the most noteworthy being california are developing regulatory programs on their own 

federal andor state regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our operating results in addition to the extent climate change restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate are less stringent than in the us or canada our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us 

on august 18 2009 the epa entered into a consent decree with environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court judge on november 16 2009 pursuant to the consent decree on january 26 2010 the epa proposed numeric criteria to replace narrative standards for nitrogen and phosphorous in lakes and inland flowing waters the epa intends to adopt numeric water quality standards for these waters by october 2010 pursuant to the consent decree the epa is also required to propose and adopt numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in coastal and estuarine water bodies in 2011 the proposed numeric water quality criteria are substantially lower than water quality criteria developed on a casebycase basis in addition on september 30 2009 the epa proposed a total maximum daily load tmdl for certain bodies of water within the charlotte harbor and peace river watersheds the proposed tmdl specifies a zero nutrient load from all national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes dischargers within these watersheds including our npdes discharge associated with our mining operation in hardee county 

the outcome of these regulatory initiatives could result in more stringent waste water discharge limits for our mining manufacturing and distribution operations in florida the specific limits imposed on wastewater discharges from our facilities will depend on the criteria that are adopted and the development of specific permit conditions that are consistent with these criteria more stringent limits could increase our costs andor limit our operations and therefore could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the united states and canada including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases these laws include the clean air act the clean water act rcra cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes 

cf industries holdings inc 

as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations additionally future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or more vigorous enforcement of current laws and regulations whether caused by violations of environmental and health and safety laws by us or other chemical fertilizer companies or otherwise may require us to make substantial expenditures additionally our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

see item 1 business—environmental health and safety and item 3 legal proceedings for additional information on our environmental and legal matters 

our operations are dependent on numerous required permits approvals and financial assurance requirements from governmental authorities 

we hold numerous environmental mining and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion of our operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in certain cases as a condition to procure such permits and approvals or as a condition to maintain existing approvals we may be required to comply with regulatory financial assurance requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure local state or federal government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities for example in 2006 we established an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection as a means of complying with floridas regulations governing financial assurance related to closure and postclosure of phosphogypsum stacks 

we may be subject to additional financial assurance requirements in connection with an enforcement initiative concerning compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra at our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex a final settlement may require us to meet specified financial tests andor contribute cash or other qualifying assets into a trust designated to be used for closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack systems upon closure we are currently in negotiations with the united states department of justice and the united states environmental protection agency on this aspect as well as other aspects of the enforcement initiative 

cf industries holdings inc 

florida regulations also mandate payment of certain mining taxes based on the quantity of ore mined and are subject to change based on local regulatory approvals additional financial assurance requirements or other increases in local mining regulations and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

florida regulations also require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities the demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds letters of credit insurance policies or similar instruments it is possible that we will not be able to comply with either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2009 the area permitted by local state and federal authorities for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 46 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current operating rates for approximately 13 years we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated 34 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately ten additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

likewise our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2014 at current operating rates and is subject to regular renewals of our operating permits we have secured the local development authorization to increase the capacity of this stack system based on this authorization estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately eight years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

acts of terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities our plants and ancillary facilities may be targets of terrorist activities many of these plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other items that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition due to concerns related to 

cf industries holdings inc 

terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations impacting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues andor reduced profit margins 

our operations are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and an increase in the price or any delay or interruption in the delivery of these raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas ammonia and sulfur as raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase these raw materials from thirdparty suppliers prices for these raw materials can fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand we may not be able to pass along to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business these products are transported by barge truck rail or pipeline to our facilities by thirdparty transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw materials including those caused by capacity constraints explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving pipelines deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime or labor difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our investments in securities are subject to risks that may result in losses 

we invest in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us government those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities our investments are subject to fluctuations in both market value and yield based upon changes in market conditions including interest rates liquidity general economic and credit market conditions and conditions specific to the issuers 

at december 31 2009 we held investments of 1339 million in taxexempt auction rate securities these securities were issued by various state and local government entities and are all supported by student loans that were primarily issued under the federal family loan program these auction rate securities have stated maturities that range up to 38 years and the underlying securities are guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities in february 2008 the market for these securities began to show signs of illiquidity and auctions for several securities failed on their scheduled auction dates as a result we continue to hold investments in certain of these securities these investments for which auctions have failed are no longer liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until such time as an auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 

due to the risks of investments we may not achieve expected returns or may realize losses on our investments which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

the loss of key members of our management and professional staff may adversely affect our business 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our senior management and professional staff the loss of one or more key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally if we are unable to find hire and retain 

cf industries holdings inc 

needed key personnel in the future our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

deterioration of global market and economic conditions including those related to the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a continued slowdown of economic activity caused by the current recession could adversely affect our business in the following ways a worsening of the current credit markets could impact the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital the failure of certain key suppliers or derivative counterparties could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses and the continuation of both the volatility of interest rates and negative market returns could result in increased expense and greater contributions to our defined benefit plans

in december 2004 and january 2005 the united states environmental protection agency epa inspected our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex to evaluate the facilitys compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the federal statute that governs the generation transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous wastes this inspection was undertaken as a part of a broad enforcement initiative commenced by the epa to evaluate whether mineral processing and mining facilities including in particular all wet process phosphoric acid production facilities are in compliance with rcra and the extent to which such facilities waste management practices have impacted the environment 

by letter dated september 27 2005 epa region 4 issued to the company a notice of violation nov and compliance evaluation inspection report the nov and compliance evaluation inspection report alleged a number of violations of rcra including violations relating to recordkeeping the failure to properly make hazardous waste determinations as required by rcra and alleged treatment of sulfuric acid waste without a permit the most significant allegation in the nov is that the plant city facilitys reuse of phosphoric acid process water which is otherwise exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste in the production of ammoniated phosphate fertilizer and the return of this process water to the facilitys process water recirculating system have resulted in the disposal of hazardous waste into the system without a permit the compliance evaluation inspection report indicates that as a result the entire process water system including all pipes ditches cooling ponds and gypsum stacks could be regulated as hazardous waste management units under rcra 

several of the companys competitors have received novs making this same allegation this particular recycling of process water is common in the industry and the company believes was authorized by the epa in 1990 the company also believes that this allegation is inconsistent with recent case law governing the scope of the epas regulatory authority under rcra nonetheless the company has conducted a successful pilot test to replace process water as a scrubbing medium at the ammonium phosphate fertilizer plants and maintain compliance with plant citys air permit the company has received a permit from the florida department of environmental protection that

authorizes the company to make this change for the three ammonium phosphate plants that utilize process water although this does not fully resolve the nov or address all of the issues identified by the epa and the united states department of justice doj this does address a significant issue identified in the nov 

the nov indicated that the company is liable for penalties up to the statutory maximum for example the statutory maximum per day of noncompliance for each violation that occurred after march 15 2004 is 32500 per day although penalties of this magnitude are rarely if ever imposed the company is at risk of incurring substantial civil penalties with respect to these allegations the epa has referred this matter to the doj for enforcement the company is currently in negotiations with the doj that have included not only the issues identified in the nov but other operational practices of the company and its competitors a final settlement may include the requirement for the company to meet specified financial tests andor contribute cash or other qualifying assets into a trust designated to be used for the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack systems upon closure the company does not know if this matter will be resolved prior to the commencement of litigation by the united states 

on march 19 2007 the company received a letter from the epa under section 114 of the federal clean air act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with new source review new source performance standards and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants at the plant city facility the company responded to this letter with the information requested completing the document production process in late 2007 the epa initiated this same process in relation to numerous other sulfuric acid plants and phosphoric acid plants throughout the nation including other facilities in florida in some cases the epa filed enforcement proceedings asserting that the facilities had not complied with the clean air act to date these enforcement proceedings have been resolved through settlements it is not known at this time whether the epa will initiate enforcement with respect to the plant city facility 

pursuant to a letter from the doj dated july 28 2008 that was sent to representatives of the major us phosphoric acid manufacturers including cf industries inc the doj stated that it and the epa believe that apparent violations of section 313 of the emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcra which requires annual reports to be submitted with respect to the use of certain toxic chemicals have occurred at all of the phosphoric acid facilities operated by these manufacturers the letter also states that the doj and the epa believe that most of these facilities have violated section 304 of epcra and section 103 of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla by failing to provide required notifications relating to the release of hydrogen fluoride from these facilities the letter did not specifically identify alleged violations at our plant city florida complex or assert a claim for a specific amount of penalties the epa submitted an information request to the company on february 11 2009 as a followup to the july 2008 letter the company provided initial informational responses to the agencys inquiry on may 14 and may 29 2009 the epa has not yet responded to the companys responses 

as a result of the factors discussed above we cannot estimate the potential penalties fines or other expenditures if any that may result from the plant city environmental matters and therefore we cannot determine if the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows

we are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products in north america our operations are organized into two business segments the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment principal products in the nitrogen segment are ammonia urea and urea ammonium nitrate solution or uan principal products in the phosphate segment are diammonium phosphate or dap monoammonium phosphate or map and granular muriate of potash or potash our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern us grainproducing states our principal customers are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors we also export nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products from our florida and louisiana manufacturing facilities which can ship internationally due to their locations 

our principal assets include 

• the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in north america donaldsonville louisiana • a 66 economic interest in the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in canada which we operate in medicine hat alberta through canadian fertilizers limited cfl a consolidated variable interest entity • one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer complexes in the united states plant city florida • the mostrecently constructed phosphate rock mine and associated beneficiation plant in the united states hardee county florida 37 

cf industries holdings inc 

• an extensive system of terminals warehouses and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern united states and • a 50 interest in keytrade ag keytrade a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near zurich switzerland which we account for as an equity method investment financial executive summary 

• we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 3656 million in 2009 compared to 6846 million in 2008 our results for 2009 included • a net pretax unrealized marktomarket gain of 875 million 540 million after tax on natural gas derivatives in our nitrogen segment • 534 million 449 million after tax of business combination related expenses and 359 million no tax impact of development costs for our proposed nitrogen complex in peru the business combination related expenses are associated with cf holdings proposed business combination with terra industries inc terra and costs associated with responding to agrium incs agrium proposed acquisition of cf holdings and • an 119 million 74 million after tax gain on the sale of terra common stock net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 6846 million in 2008 included a net 638 million pretax 411 million after tax unrealized marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives in our nitrogen segment and a 570 million 367 million after tax noncash inventory valuation charge in our phosphate segment 

• our gross margin decreased by 3833 million to 8394 million in 2009 compared to 12227 million in 2008 the decrease in gross margin resulted mainly from lower average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices partially offset by lower raw material costs unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives versus unrealized losses in 2008 and lower purchased product costs • our net sales decreased 33 to 26 billion in 2009 compared to 39 billion in 2008 the decrease reflected lower average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices partially offset by higher phosphate segment sales volume due mainly to increased export sales total sales volume was 81 million tons in 2009 as compared to 79 million tons in 2008 • cash flow from operations increased 432 million to 6818 million in 2009 due primarily to strong shipping activity in 2009 that reduced inventories partially offset by lower operating results than we experienced in 2008 when selling prices had reached unprecedented levels particularly for phosphate products • as of december 31 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents of 6971 million shortterm investments of 1850 million 1339 million of illiquid investments in auction rate securities 1602 million of marketable equity securities and a 1595 million current liability attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under our forward pricing program fpp as of december 31 2008 we had cash and cash equivalents of 6250 million illiquid investments in auction rate securities of 1778 million and customer advances of 3478 million • we paid cash dividends of 194 million in 2009 a decrease of 26 million from 2008 due to fewer common shares outstanding as a result of our fourth quarter 2008 share repurchase program 38

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

through the end of 2002 we operated as a traditional supply cooperative our focus was on providing an assured supply of fertilizer to the eight cooperatives who were the stockholders of cf industries inc prior to the completion of our initial public offering and reorganization transaction preipo owners typically over 80 of our annual sales volume was to our preipo owners though important financial performance was subordinate to our mandated supply objective 

in 2002 we adopted a new business model that established financial performance rather than assured supply to our preipo owners as our principal objective a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace under the new business model we began to pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on financial performance one result of this approach was a substantial shift in our customer mix by 2009 our sales to customers other than our preipo owners and viterra inc our partner in cfl reached approximately 62 of our total sales volume for the year which was more than triple the comparable percentage for 2002 

cf holdings was formed as a delaware corporation in april 2005 to hold the existing businesses of cf industries inc on august 16 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock we sold approximately 474 million shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 7154 million we did not retain any of the proceeds from our ipo in connection with our ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction in which cf industries inc ceased to be a cooperative and became our whollyowned subsidiary in the reorganization transaction all of the equity interests in cf industries inc were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the ipo and approximately 76 million shares of our common stock 

significant items 

market conditions in 2009 were weaker than experienced in 2008 as lower demand for our products resulted from high industrywide inventories entering the year poor weather conditions and our customers hesitancy to restock due to an uncertain pricing environment pricing levels and raw material costs had reached unprecedented levels in 2008 but both declined in 2009 by late 2009 conditions had improved with expectations of a strong spring 2010 planting season and a tightening of the international supplydemand balance consolidated net sales in 2009 decreased by 13 billion or 33 to 26 billion with decreases due primarily to lower average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments this decrease was partially offset by potash sales and higher uan and phosphate export sales that we made in response to reduced domestic demand there were no potash sales in 2008 gross margin decreased by 3833 million to 8394 million in 2009 as the impact of lower average selling prices was partially mitigated by lower raw material costs and 875 million 540 million after tax of unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives results in 2009 include 534 million 449 million after tax of business combination expenses 359 million no tax impact of peru project costs and an 119 million gain 74 million after tax on the sale of terra

common stock acquired during 2009 see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on activity related to proposed business combinations 

during 2008 the nitrogen and phosphate segments experienced record high selling prices due to favorable supply and demand balances until the fourth quarter when sharply reduced fertilizer demand significantly impacted nitrogen and phosphate selling prices factors leading to reduced demand included poor weather in north america declining crop prices and reduced credit availability consolidated net sales increased by 11 billion or 42 to 39 billion in 2008 with increases due to higher average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments gross margin increased by 5527 million in 2008 our 2008 gross margin included a 638 million pretax 411 million after tax unrealized marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives in 2008 we began purchasing and storing potash fertilizer in our distribution network for sale in the spring season of 2009 the potash results are included in the phosphate segment during the fourth quarter we recorded a 570 million pretax 367 million after tax noncash charge to write down our phosphate 303 million and potash 267 million inventories as the carrying cost exceeded the estimated net realizable values 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we repurchased and retired 85 million shares of our common stock for approximately 500 million at an average price of 5896 per share under a program authorized by our board of directors 

both the nitrogen and phosphate segments in 2007 were favorably impacted by improved demand and pricing as a robust agricultural economy characterized by strong domestic and international grain markets produced high global demand for fertilizer increasing demand pushed average selling prices higher as the year progressed consolidated net sales increased by 7238 million or 36 to 28 billion in 2007 with increases in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments gross margin increased by 5228 million in 2007 to 6700 million our 2007 gross margin included a 170 million pretax 110 million after tax unrealized marktomarket gain on natural gas derivatives 

during 2007 we purchased a 50 voting interest in keytrade for 259 million we also provided 137 million in subordinated financing for keytrade under notes that will mature in september 2017 and preferred stock we report keytrade as an equity method investment 

we periodically review the depreciable lives assigned to our production facilities and related assets as well as estimated production capacities used to develop our unitsofproduction uop depreciation expense and we change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews in the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed such a review and as a result we increased the depreciable lives of certain assets at our nitrogen production facilities from ten years to fifteen years separately we revised the estimates of production capacities for certain uop assets at our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex and all uop assets at our plant city florida phosphate complex the effect of this change in estimate for the twelve months ended december 31 2007 was an increase in earnings before income taxes of 103 million an increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 67 million and an increase in diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders of 012 

key industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

cf industries holdings inc 

global supply  demand 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key consumingexporting countries such as china india or brazil often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs availability of raw materials government policies and global trade 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea and uan because all of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses expenditures on natural gas comprised approximately 52 of the total cost of our nitrogen fertilizer sales in 2009 and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization 

farmers economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns and the types of crops planted 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters changes in currency values alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east the former soviet union the republic of trinidad and tobago and venezuela are major exporters to north america 

the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer andor trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations 

cf industries holdings inc 

political and social government policies 

the political and social policies of governments around the world can result in the restriction of imports the subsidization of domestic producers andor the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives 

factors affecting our results 

net sales our net sales are derived from the sale of nitrogen phosphate and potash fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of nitrogen phosphate and potash fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales 

cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs product purchases and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

we utilize our forward pricing program fpp to manage some of the risks created by the volatility of fertilizer prices and natural gas costs through our fpp we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost using natural gas derivative instruments we report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward pricing program later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products under our fpp often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

selling general and administrative expenses our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees 

other operating—net other operating—net includes the costs associated with our business combination related expenses and development costs for our proposed nitrogen complex in peru as well as our closed bartow phosphate facility and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations the business combination related expenses are associated with our proposed business combination with terra and costs associated with responding to agriums proposed acquisition of cf holdings see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on activity related to proposed business combinations bartow facility costs include provisions for phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond closure costs water treatment costs and costs associated with the cessation of operations costs included in other costs include amounts recorded for environmental remediation 

cf industries holdings inc 

for other areas of our business litigation expenses gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets and impairment charges for goodwill 

interest expense our interest expense includes the interest on our notes payable annual fees on our senior secured revolving credit facility and amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements 

interest income our interest income represents amounts earned on our cash cash equivalents investments and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 

other nonoperating—net other nonoperating net includes gains and losses recognized on the sale of securities as well as dividends earned the amounts recorded include activity related to our investment in terra common stock see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes our income tax provision includes all currently payable and deferred united states and canadian income tax expense applicable to our ongoing operations 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and nonoperating—net respectively 

in connection with our initial public offering ipo in august 2005 cf industries inc cfi ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes and we entered into a net operating loss agreement nol agreement with cfis preipo owners relating to the future utilization of the preipo net operating loss carryforwards nols under the nol agreement if it is finally determined that the nols can be utilized to offset applicable postipo taxable income we will pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved 

cfl operates as a cooperative for canadian income tax purposes and distributes all of its earnings as patronage dividends to its customers including cfi for canadian income tax purposes cfl is permitted to deduct an amount equal to the patronage dividends it distributes to its customers provided that certain requirements are met as a result cfl records no income tax provision 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates—net of taxes equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates—net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the entities in which we have an ownership interest and exert significant operational and financial influence income taxes related to these investments if any are reflected in this line the amounts recorded as equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated affiliates—net of taxes relate to our investment in keytrade 

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest amounts reported as net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest represent the 34 interest in the net operating results of cfl a canadian consolidated variable interest entity we own 49 of the voting common stock of cfl and 66 of cfls nonvoting preferred stock viterra inc viterra owns 34 of the voting common stock and nonvoting preferred stock of cfl the remaining 17 of the voting common stock of cfl is owned by growmark inc growmark and la coop fédérée we designate four members of cfls ninemember board of directors viterra designates three members and growmark and la coop fédérée each designate one member 

cf industries holdings inc 

we operate the medicine hat facility and purchase approximately 66 of the facilitys ammonia and urea production pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either us or cfl upon a twelvemonth notice viterra has the right but not the obligation to purchase the remaining 34 of the facilitys ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement to the extent that viterra does not purchase its 34 of the facilitys production we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts since 1995 however viterra or its predecessor has purchased at least 34 of the facilitys production each year 

under the product purchase agreements both we and viterra pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases however the product purchase agreements also provide that cfl will distribute its net earnings to us and viterra annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from cfl the distributions to viterra are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows as we consider these payments to be similar to dividends our product purchase agreement also requires us to advance funds to cfl in the event that cfl is unable to meet its debts as they become due the amount of each advance would be related to the amount of product we purchase or at least 66 of the deficiency and would be more in any year in which we purchased more than 66 of medicine hats production a similar obligation also exists for viterra we and viterra currently manage cfl such that each party is responsible for its share of cfls fixed costs and that cfls production volume meets the parties combined requirements the management agreement the product purchase agreements and any other agreements related to cfl are subject to change with the consent of both parties

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

consolidated operating results 

our total gross margin decreased by 3833 million to 8394 million for 2009 from a gross margin of 12227 million for 2008 due mainly to lower phosphate segment results phosphate segment gross margins decreased 3972 million in 2009 to 552 million from 4524 million in 2008 primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower raw material costs nitrogen segment results improved slightly in 2009 with gross margins increasing 139 million to 7842 million from 7703 million in 2008 as realized natural gas costs unrealized marktomarket 

cf industries holdings inc 

gains on our natural gas derivatives versus unrealized marktomarket losses in 2008 and lower purchased product costs contributed to the increase net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 3656 million for 2009 included 534 million 449 million after tax of costs associated with our proposed business combination with terra and the cost of responding to agriums proposed acquisition of cf holdings 359 million no tax impact of development costs related to our proposed project in peru a net pretax unrealized marktomarket gain of 875 million 540 million after tax on natural gas derivatives and an 119 million 74 million after tax gain on the sale of terra common stock net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 6846 million for 2008 included a pretax unrealized marktomarket loss of 638 million 411 million after tax on natural gas derivatives as well as a 570 million 367 million after tax noncash inventory valuation charge 

net sales 

our net sales decreased 33 to 26 billion in 2009 from 39 billion in 2008 reflecting declines in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments our total sales volume increased to 81 million tons in 2009 from 79 million tons in 2008 in the nitrogen segment net sales decreased 7518 million to 18 billion in 2009 compared to 26 billion in 2008 due primarily to lower average selling prices average nitrogen selling prices for 2009 decreased 26 from record high selling prices in 2008 nitrogen sales volume in 2009 decreased 290000 tons or 5 to 59 million tons for 2009 compared to 61 million tons in 2008 the decrease primarily in uan was due to weather related delays high downstream inventories in the first half of the year and customer hesitancy to replenish their inventory for next year in the phosphate segment net sales of 7691 million in 2009 were 42 lower than the 13 billion in 2008 due to lower average phosphate fertilizer selling prices partially offset by higher phosphate and potash sales volume our total level of phosphate segment sales volume was 22 million tons for 2009 compared to 18 million tons sold in 2008 the increase in 2009 was due primarily to increased phosphate export sales we purchased and stored 164000 tons of potash in the second half of 2008 initiated sales in the second quarter and depleted our inventory later in 2009 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales in our nitrogen segment averaged 180 per ton for 2009 compared to 296 per ton in 2008 a decrease of 39 this decrease was due largely to lower realized natural gas costs unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives compared to unrealized losses in the prior year and lower purchased product costs the phosphate segment cost of sales averaged 317 per ton for 2009 compared to 491 per ton in the prior year a decrease of 35 this decrease was due mainly to lower sulfur and ammonia costs partially offset by the cost of potash fertilizer which was purchased at a higher average cost 

during 2009 we sold approximately 26 million tons of fertilizer under our fpp representing approximately 33 of our total sales volume for the period in 2008 we sold approximately 56 million tons of fertilizer under this program representing approximately 71 of our total sales volume for the period 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 7 to 629 million in 2009 compared to 680 million in 2008 this decrease was related primarily to a decrease in performancebased incentive compensation expense and lower longterm stockbased compensation expense 

cf industries holdings inc 

other operating—net 

other operating—net increased 922 million to 967 million in 2009 from 45 million in 2008 this increase was due primarily to 534 million of costs associated with our proposed business combination with terra the cost of responding to agriums proposed acquisition of cf holdings and 359 million of development costs related to our proposed nitrogen complex in peru 

interest—net 

interest—net decreased 215 million to 30 million of net interest income in 2009 from 245 million of net interest income in 2008 due primarily to lower average interest rates 

other nonoperating—net 

other nonoperating income increased 121 million to 128 million in 2009 from 07 million in the prior year the increase was due primarily to an 119 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2009 on the sale of 20 million of our 70 million shares of terra common stock refer to note 9 and note 35 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on activity related to proposed business combinations and subsequent events 

income taxes 

our income tax provision for 2009 was 2460 million compared to a tax provision of 3781 million on pretax earnings for 2008 the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2009 based on the reported tax provision of 2460 million and reported pretax income of 6956 million is 354 this compares to 322 in the prior year the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2009 based on pretax income exclusive of the noncontrolling interest is 402 this compares to 357 in the prior year the 2009 increase in the effective tax rate based on pretax income exclusive of noncontrolling interest results principally from an increase in nondeductible costs associated with terra agrium and peru activities see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates—net of taxes 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates—net of taxes for 2009 and 2008 consists of our share of the operating results of keytrade 

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest 

amounts reported as net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest represent the interest of the 34 holder of cfls common and preferred shares the decrease in 2009 was due to a decline in cfls operating results due to lower average selling prices for nitrogen fertilizers in canada 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders and weightedaverage common shares outstanding 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased to 742 per share for 2009 from 1213 per share for 2008 due primarily to the decrease in net earnings attributable to common stockholders partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of the share repurchase program that was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2008 the number of diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding decreased 72 million shares to 492 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 564 million for 2008

our total gross margin increased by 5527 million to 12227 million for 2008 from a gross margin of 6700 million for 2007 due to improved results in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments nitrogen gross margins increased 3235 million to 7703 million in 2008 from 4468 million in 2007 due to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher realized natural gas costs higher purchased product costs and an unrealized marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives phosphate segment gross margins increased 2292 million in 2008 to 4524 million from 2232 million in 2007 due to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher raw material costs and an unfavorable inventory valuation charge net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 6846 million for 2008 included a net pretax unrealized marktomarket loss of 638 million 411 million after tax on natural gas derivatives as well as a 570 million 367 million after tax noncash inventory valuation charge in our phosphate segment net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 3727 million for 2007 included a pretax unrealized marktomarket gain of 170 million 110 million after tax on natural gas derivatives 

net sales 

our net sales were 39 billion for 2008 or 11 billion higher than net sales for 2007 our total sales volume decreased 11 to 79 million tons for 2008 versus 89 million tons for 2007 in the nitrogen segment net sales increased 5492 million to 26 billion in 2008 compared to 20 billion in 2007 due primarily to higher average selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume average nitrogen selling prices for 2008 increased 44 nitrogen sales volume in 2008 decreased 797000 tons or 11 to 61 million tons for 2008 compared to 69 million tons in 2007 due mainly to poor weather conditions during the spring and fall application periods and the decision to reduce sales of lowmargin purchased uan in the phosphate segment net sales of 13 billion in 2008 were 86 higher than the 7148 million in 2007 due to higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume average phosphate selling prices for 2008 increased 108 from 2007 our total level of phosphate sales volume was 18 million tons for 2008 compared to 20 million tons sold in 2007 the decrease in 2008 was caused by reduced domestic demand due to customers deferring phosphate purchases because of ample downstream inventories and uncertain farm economics 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales in our nitrogen segment averaged 296 per ton for 2008 compared to 230 per ton in 2007 an increase of 29 this increase was due largely to higher purchased product costs higher realized natural gas costs and the effect of unrealized marktomarket adjustments on natural gas derivatives the phosphate segment cost of sales averaged 491 per ton for 2008 compared to 247 per ton in the prior year an increase of 99 this increase was due mainly to higher sulfur and ammonia costs and an inventory valuation charge 

during 2008 we sold approximately 56 million tons of fertilizer under our fpp representing approximately 71 of our total sales volume for the period in 2007 we sold approximately 54 million tons of fertilizer under this program representing approximately 60 of our total sales volume for the period 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 4 to 680 million in 2008 compared to 652 million in 2007 this increase was related primarily to corporate office expenses including 

cf industries holdings inc 

consulting fees legal fees and expenses related to performancebased incentive compensation these increases were partially offset by lower longterm stockbased compensation other compensationrelated costs and higher acquisition expenses in the prior period related to our 2007 investment in keytrade 

other operating—net 

other operating—net increased 13 million to 45 million in 2008 from 32 million in 2007 this increase includes a 46 million charge in 2008 primarily for asset retirement obligations aros to recognize revised cost estimates to close the cooling pond and phosphogypsum stack system at our closed bartow florida facility both 2008 and 2007 include gains that were recognized upon the sale of certain closed facilities or property and equipment during 2008 we recorded a gain on the sale of both the excess land at our previous headquarters in long grove illinois and certain property and equipment at our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex in 2007 we recognized a gain when we sold a warehouse and a parcel of land at bartow for a detailed explanation of the accounting for aros at bartow please refer to note 13 of our consolidated financial statements 

interest—net 

net interest income increased 18 million to 245 million in 2008 from 227 million in 2007 due to higher average balances of invested cash and higher average rates of return on securities held 

income taxes 

our income tax provision for 2008 was 3781 million compared to a tax provision of 1995 million on pretax earnings for 2007 the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2008 based on the reported tax provision of 3781 million and reported pretax income of 11754 million is 322 this compares to 319 in the prior year the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2008 based on pretax income exclusive of the noncontrolling interest was 357 this compares to 349 in the prior year the increase in the effective tax rate in 2008 based on pretax income exclusive of noncontrolling interest results principally from lower taxexempt interest income earned on our investments in 2008 see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates—net of taxes 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates—net of taxes for 2008 and 2007 consisted of our share of the operating results of keytrade 

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest 

amounts reported as net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest represent the interest of the 34 holder of cfls common and preferred shares the increase in 2008 was due to strong cfl operating results the improvement in cfl operating results reflected higher sales prices for nitrogen fertilizers produced in canada 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders and weightedaverage common shares outstanding 

diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders increased to 1213 per share for 2008 from 656 per share for 2007 due primarily to the increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding of 564 million for 2008 approximated the prior year level

operating results by business segment 

our business is organized and managed internally based on two segments the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment which are differentiated primarily by their products the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate 

nitrogen segment 

the following table presents summary operating data for our nitrogen segment 



1 includes export sales of 36000 tons for 2009 and 12000 tons for 2008 there were no export sales in 2007 2 includes export sales of 339000 tons for 2009 there were no export sales of uan in 2008 or 2007 3 includes the cost of natural gas purchases and realized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives 4 total production at donaldsonville and medicine hat including the 34 interest of viterra the noncontrolling interest holder of cfl 5 gross ammonia production including amounts subsequently upgraded onsite into urea andor uan

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

net sales nitrogen segment net sales decreased 29 to 18 billion in 2009 compared to 26 billion in 2008 due primarily to lower average selling prices for all nitrogen fertilizers average selling prices decreased in 2009 from record high prices in 2008 nitrogen sales volume decreased 5 to 59 million tons in 2009 compared to 61 million tons in 2008 due to lower uan sales volume ammonia and urea sales volume in 2009 approximated the volume in 2008 the 293000 ton decrease in uan sales volumes resulted primarily from weak domestic demand offset partially by an increase in export sales poor weather high downstream inventories entering the year and uncertainty about the 2010 application season contributed to the decline in domestic demand for uan weak domestic demand for uan was mitigated by taking advantage of export opportunities 

cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment decreased 42 to 180 per ton for 2009 compared to 296 per ton for 2008 due primarily to lower realized natural gas costs unrealized gains from marktomarket adjustments on natural gas derivatives in 2009 versus unrealized losses in 2008 and lower purchased product costs we report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur we recognized a net 875 million unrealized marktomarket gain in 2009 compared to a 638 million unrealized marktomarket loss in 2008 the overall weightedaverage cost of natural gas supplied to our donaldsonville facility and cfls medicine hat facility including realized gains and losses on derivatives decreased by 46 in 2009 versus the cost in 2008 natural gas prices declined in 2009 due to decreased demand resulting primarily from the global economic slowdown and record high storage levels the costs of finished products purchased for resale were approximately 1291 million lower in 2009 than in 2008 due to both lower prices and a lower volume of product purchased for resale 

during 2009 we sold approximately 23 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under our fpp representing approximately 40 of our nitrogen sales volume for the period in 2008 we sold approximately 45 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program representing approximately 74 of our nitrogen sales volume for the period 

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

net sales nitrogen segment net sales increased 27 to 26 billion in 2008 compared to 20 billion in 2007 due to higher average selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume the 44 increase in average ammonia selling prices for 2008 was driven primarily by both a tight domestic and international supplydemand balance and the expectation of strong midwest fall application seasons strength in international markets reflecting a reduction in chinese exports and increased demand in latin america contributed to the 40 increase in average urea selling prices the 49 increase in average uan selling prices for 2008 compared to 2007 reflected the impact of reduced import volume below average producer inventory and stronger conditions in the international market through the third quarter of 2008 while spot selling prices across all nitrogen products decreased significantly later in the year we benefited from the substantial volume we had booked under our fpp with prices that were established earlier in the year nitrogen sales volume decreased 11 to 61 million tons in 2008 compared to 69 million tons in 2007 ammonia volume which decreased approximately 355000 tons in 2008 was impacted by poor weather conditions during both the spring and the fall application periods also overall nitrogen consumption including ammonia was affected during the spring by a reduction in planted corn acres relative to the previous year the 3 decrease in urea sales volumes resulted from relatively full downstream inventories late in the year the 349000 ton decrease in uan sales volumes resulted primarily from our decision to reduce sales of lowmargin purchased uan and a 

cf industries holdings inc 

slowdown in demand stemming from high downstream inventories in the second half of the year caused by product carryover from weak spring product movement 

cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment increased 29 to 296 per ton for 2008 compared to 230 per ton for 2007 due largely to higher realized natural gas costs and higher purchased product costs in addition to unrealized marktomarket adjustments on natural gas derivatives we report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur we recognized a net 638 million unrealized marktomarket loss in 2008 compared to a net 170 million unrealized marktomarket gain in 2007 the costs of finished products purchased for resale were approximately 1040 million higher in 2008 than in 2007 due primarily to the overall increase in nitrogen prices the overall weightedaverage cost of natural gas supplied to our donaldsonville facility and cfls medicine hat facility including realized gains and losses on derivatives increased by 22 in 2008 versus the cost in 2007 cold temperatures in the first quarter of 2008 along with strong crude oil prices throughout most of the first nine months of 2008 helped drive natural gas prices higher relative to the prior year however in the fourth quarter natural gas prices declined to levels consistent with the fourth quarter of 2007 due to reduced demand driven by the overall global economic slowdown 

during 2008 we sold approximately 45 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under our fpp representing approximately 74 of our nitrogen sales volume for the period in 2007 we sold approximately 46 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program representing approximately 66 of our nitrogen sales volume for the period

net sales phosphate segment net sales decreased 42 to 7691 million for 2009 compared to 13300 million in 2008 due primarily to lower average selling prices partially offset by higher sales volume average phosphate fertilizer selling prices during 2009 decreased 56 to 326 per ton from the record high levels in 2008 driven by lower domestic demand the decrease in domestic demand resulted from high downstream inventories tightness in the financial credit markets and customer resistance to price volatility our phosphate segment sales volume increased 26 to 22 million tons in 2009 compared to 18 million tons in 2008 primarily due to an increase in phosphate fertilizer export sales in response to lower domestic demand and the sale of 164000 tons of potash we had no potash sales in the year ended december 31 2008 

cost of sales phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged 283 per ton for 2009 a 40 decrease from 475 per ton in the prior year this decrease was due mainly to lower sulfur and ammonia costs sulfur costs decreased by more than 400 per long ton from the record high prices in 2008 resulting primarily from decreases in demand due to reductions in phosphate production the 56 roughly 300 per short ton decrease in ammonia costs also reflects a weaker international ammonia market 

inventory valuation reserves during 2009 we ceased sales of potash which have been reported in the phosphate segment the gross margin on potash sales was a loss of 339 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 285 million in 2008 at december 31 2008 we recorded a 570 million noncash charge to write down our phosphate and potash inventories by 303 million and 267 million respectively as the carrying cost of the inventories exceeded the estimated net realizable values net realizable values for our phosphate and potash inventories are determined considering the fertilizer pricing environment at the time as well as our expectations of future price realizations the inventory that was held at december 31 2008 included inventory that was produced or purchased earlier when input costs and fertilizer prices were higher during the first quarter of 2009 we sold all of the higher cost phosphate inventory that existed at december 31 2008 throughout 2009 we reassessed the net realizable values of the inventory held based on this analysis no additional inventory valuation reserves were necessary for the phosphate fertilizer inventory however during the first and second quarters of 2009 additional inventory valuation reserves of 243 million and 50 million respectively were recognized related to the potash inventory during the third quarter we sold all remaining potash inventory see the critical accounting policies and estimates later in this discussion and analysis for additional information on our accounting policies related to inventory valuation 

during 2009 we sold approximately 319000 tons of phosphate fertilizer under our fpp representing approximately 14 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period in 2008 we sold approximately 11 million tons of phosphate fertilizer under this program representing approximately 61 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period 

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

net sales phosphate segment net sales increased 86 to 13300 million for 2008 compared to 7148 million in 2007 due primarily to higher average selling prices average phosphate selling prices during 2008 more than doubled compared to prices in 2007 the increase was driven by strong worldwide demand caused by tightening world crop balances record grain and oilseed prices and increases in raw material prices while spot phosphate selling prices weakened during the last quarter of 2008 we benefited from certain sales made through our fpp at prices agreed upon earlier in the year our phosphate sales volume decreased 10 to 18 million tons in 2008 compared to 20 million tons in 2007 although export sales increased by 87000 tons domestic sales volumes dropped 294000 

cf industries holdings inc 

tons most of this decline occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 as downstream retailer and distributor inventories were full and customers deferred phosphate purchases due to uncertain farm economics 

cost of sales phosphate segment cost of sales averaged 491 per ton for 2008 almost double the 247 per ton in the prior year this increase was due mainly to higher sulfur and ammonia costs and a 570 million noncash inventory valuation adjustment both sulfur and ammonia costs demonstrated significant volatility during the year average annual sulfur costs for 2008 were more than five times the costs for 2007 due to continued tightening in the international markets during the first half of the year which carried over from the end of 2007 as the international markets began to loosen in the second half of the year domestic supply was interrupted due to hurricanes in the gulf coast in the third quarter but the sulfur market collapsed in the fourth quarter due to phosphate production curtailments worldwide an 81 increase in ammonia costs reflected a strong international market until late in the year when demand for phosphate production decreased 

inventory valuation reserves in the second half of 2008 we purchased and stored potash fertilizer in our distribution network for sale in 2009 the potash results are included in the phosphate segment throughout the first nine months of 2008 the pricing environment for both phosphate and potash fertilizers was very strong due to favorable industry conditions during the fourth quarter of 2008 phosphate and potash fertilizer selling prices declined due to lower fertilizer demand resulting from declining crop prices poor weather for fall application and uncertainty surrounding the global financial crisis we also experienced a drop in raw material input costs including a significant drop in the costs of both ammonia and sulfur as compared to the first three quarters of 2008 ammonia and sulfur are primary raw materials used in the production of phosphate based fertilizers the decline in raw material prices had a favorable impact on operating margins as inventory production costs and resulting inventory values declined however the phosphate inventories held at december 31 2008 were a combination of inventories built earlier in the year when raw material costs and selling prices were higher and inventories built near the end of the year when both raw material costs and selling prices were lower the potash inventory held at the end of 2008 was purchased at prices agreed upon earlier in the year net realizable values for our phosphate and potash inventory balances were determined considering the fertilizer pricing environment at the end of the year as well as our expectations of future price realizations based on these pricing expectations and the fact that higher priced inventory that was produced or purchased earlier in the year was held at year end we recorded a 570 million noncash charge to write down our phosphate and potash inventories by 303 million and 267 million respectively as the carrying cost of the inventories exceeded the estimated net realizable values see the critical accounting policies and estimates later in this discussion and analysis for additional information on our accounting policies related to inventory valuation 

during 2008 we sold approximately 11 million tons of phosphate fertilizer under our fpp representing approximately 61 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period in 2007 we sold approximately 835000 tons of phosphate fertilizer under this program representing approximately 42 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is cash from operations which includes customer advances our primary uses of cash are for operating costs working capital capital expenditures investments and dividends our working capital requirements are affected by several factors including demand for our products selling prices for our products raw material costs freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business under our shortterm investment policy we invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the 

cf industries holdings inc 

us government those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities 

cash balances 

as of december 31 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents of 6971 million shortterm investments of 1850 million and a 1595 million current liability attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under our forward pricing program shortterm investments held at december 31 2009 consisted of us treasury bills with original maturities between three and six months that are reported at fair value as of december 31 2008 we had cash and cash equivalents of 6250 million and a 3478 million current liability attributable to customer advances 

investments in auction rate securities 

we hold investments in availableforsale investmentgrade taxexempt auction rate securities auction rate securities are primarily debt instruments with longterm maturities for which interest rates are expected to be reset periodically through an auction process which typically occurs every 7 to 35 days 

as of december 31 2009 our investments in auction rate securities were reported at their fair value of 1339 million after reflecting a 45 million unrealized holding loss against a par value of 1384 million these securities were all supported by student loans that were originated primarily under the federal family education loan program the underlying securities have stated maturities that range up to 38 years at december 31 2008 our investments in auction rate securities comprised of securities supported by student loans totaled 1778 million after reflecting a 208 million unrealized holding loss against a cost basis of 1986 million 

in the first quarter of 2008 the traditional auction process for auction rate securities began to fail liquidity left the market and the securities became illiquid auctions have continued to fail since that time redemptions of certain auction rate securities and sales outside the auction process have occurred during 2009 and 2008 602 million and 699 million respectively of auction rate securities have been either sold or redeemed at par value 

because auctions have continued to fail we do not consider our auction rate securities to be liquid investments we are not able to access these funds until such time as auctions for the securities succeed once again buyers are found outside the auction process andor the securities are redeemed by the issuers in accordance with our policies we review the underlying securities and assess the creditworthiness of these securities as part of our investment process in each case our reviews have continued to find these investments to be investment grade 

due to the illiquidity in the credit markets and the failed auctions that started in the first quarter of 2008 market valuations are no longer observable and we have classified these investments as level 3 securities those measured using significant unobservable inputs as disclosed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements supplemental disclosures are required regarding assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis these investments in auction rate securities represent approximately 11 of the group of assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

we completed a valuation of these investments at december 31 2009 the valuation of these securities utilizes a marktomodel approach that relies on discounted cash flows market data and inputs derived from similar instruments these models take into account among other variables base interest rates credit spreads downgrade risks defaultrecovery risk the estimated time required to work out the disruption in the traditional auction process and its effect on liquidity and the effects of 

cf industries holdings inc 

insurance and other credit enhancements based on this valuation the remaining unrealized holding loss against the cost basis in the investments at december 31 2009 was 45 million the decrease in the unrealized holding loss at december 31 2009 versus december 31 2008 is due primarily to a lower balance of auction rate securities due to redemptions and sales and a lower discount rate that was used to value the securities that is reflective of lower credit spreads the unrealized holding loss has been reported in other comprehensive income as the impairment is deemed to be temporary the unrealized holding loss that has been reported in other comprehensive income is included in the net 1339 million investment balance in auction rate securities at december 31 2009 these investments have been classified as noncurrent on our consolidated balance sheet based on market conditions and our judgment regarding the period of time that may elapse until the traditional auction process resumes or other effective market trading mechanisms develop 

the model we used to value our auction rate securities uses discounted cash flow calculations as one of the significant inputs to the ultimate determination of value the base interest rates assumed for the required rates of return are key components of the calculation of discounted cash flows if the required rate of return we used in the calculation model was 100 basis points higher the resulting holding loss would have been approximately 8 million greater we may need to recognize either additional holding gains or losses in other comprehensive income or holding losses in net earnings should changes occur in either the conditions in the credit markets or in the variables considered in our valuation model 

we believe that ultimately we will recover the historical cost for these instruments as we presently intend to hold these securities until market liquidity returns either through resumption of the auction process or otherwise we do not believe the ongoing market liquidity issues regarding these securities present any operating liquidity issues for us our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments operating cash flow and credit available under our credit facility are adequate to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future

investment in keytrade 

keytrade is a reseller of fertilizer products that it purchases from various manufacturers around the world and resells in approximately 50 countries through a network of seven offices in october 

cf industries holdings inc 

2007 we purchased 50 of the common shares of keytrade certain preferred stock and advanced funds in the form of subordinated financing in 2009 we acquired certain exclusive us marketing and terminal usage rights from keytrade for 25 million the total investment and subordinated financing in keytrade at december 31 2009 is 456 million the subordinated financing totals 124 million at december 31 2009 and is in the form of notes that mature september 30 2017 and bear interest at libor plus 100 under the terms of a commercial agreement we executed with keytrade concurrent with our investment we utilize keytrade as our exclusive exporter of phosphate fertilizer products from north america and as our exclusive importer of uan products into north america we account for keytrade as an equity method investment see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the keytrade investment 

capital spending 

capital expenditures totaled 2357 million in 2009 and were made to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements of the 939 million increase in capital expenditures in 2009 as compared to 2008 approximately 709 million related primarily to plant and equipment expenditures and approximately 230 million related to plant turnaround activity during 2009 we expect to spend approximately 150 million to 200 million on routine capital expenditures in 2010 this amount includes approximately 18 million for capital expenditures at cfl of which we are obligated to fund 66 

forward pricing program fpp 

we use our fpp to reduce margin risk created by the volatility of fertilizer prices and natural gas costs through the program we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we generally lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by using natural gas derivative instruments and fixed price purchase contracts to hedge against price changes for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers as a result of using derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives and our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment unlike nitrogen fertilizer products sold under the fpp for which we effectively fix the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials principally sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate costs as a result we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis 

customer advances which typically represent a significant portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with the fpp are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which may be several months after the order is placed as is the case for all of our sale transactions revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 we had approximately 1595 million and 3478 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheet during 2009 2008 and 2007 we sold approximately 26 million 56 million and 54 million tons of fertilizer respectively representing approximately 33 71 and 60 of our sales volume respectively under the fpp 

cf industries holdings inc 

while customer advances were a significant source of liquidity in both 2009 and 2008 the level of sales under the fpp is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers perceptions of future market fundamentals as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 we had approximately 14 million tons of nitrogen and phosphate product committed to be sold under the fpp most of this product was scheduled to ship within the next five months 

under the fpp a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors such a delay in scheduled shipment may negatively impact our reported sales and operating costs as a result these delayed shipments are generally subject to charges to the customer for storage in addition we maintain the right to cancel a forward order if delivery is not taken within a specified period of time if the level of sales under the fpp were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase also borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future fpp sales activity 

natural gas derivatives 

we use natural gas derivative instruments primarily to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on sales under the fpp our natural gas acquisition policy also allows us to establish derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our fpp 

natural gas derivatives involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts the counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions cash collateral is deposited with or received from counterparties when predetermined unrealized loss or gain thresholds are exceeded for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties individual credit limits monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements as of december 31 2009 we were not in a net liability position with any derivative counterparty and as a result no cash collateral was on deposit with counterparties 

the master netting arrangements to our derivative instruments also contain creditriskrelated contingent features that require us to maintain minimum net worth levels and certain financial ratios if we fail to meet these minimum requirements the counterparties to derivative instruments for which we are in net liability positions could require daily cash settlement of unrealized losses or some other form of credit support

in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment we are subject to financial assurance requirements pursuant to the florida regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure and maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems we established an escrow account to meet such future obligations we made annual contributions of 75 million 62 million and 94 million in february of 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively to this escrow account which by rule is earmarked to cover the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure in the first quarter of 2010 we expect to contribute another 37 million based on the predetermined funding formula as prescribed by the state of florida and an assumed rate of return of 2 on invested funds we estimate that over the subsequent 23 years our contributions will average approximately 5 million per year and may range up to 10 million in 

cf industries holdings inc 

the later years the balance in the fund is estimated to peak at 210 million in 2033 and then decline over the next five decades as closure and postclosure work is completed and the funds are used to complete settlement of the aros the amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements these expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the account which are based on the guidelines set forth in the florida regulations ultimately the cash in this account will be used to fund the closure and maintenance of the phosphogypsum stack systems 

florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities we will also be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted the demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a cash deposit arrangement based on these current regulations we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in florida utilizing either of these methods 

we may be subject to additional financial assurance requirements in connection with the enforcement initiative concerning compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra at our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex see note 31 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the rcra enforcement initiative a final settlement of this matter may require us to meet a specified financial test andor contribute cash or other qualifying assets into a trust designated to be used for closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack systems upon closure we are currently in negotiations with the united states department of justice and the united states environmental protection agency on this enforcement initiative consequently we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or its impact on future cash flows 

other liquidity requirements 

we are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations concerning surface and underground waters such regulations evolve through various stages of proposal or development and the ultimate outcome of such rulemaking activities often cannot be predicted prior to enactment at the present time proposed regulations in the state of florida are being considered to limit nutrient content in water discharges including certain specific regulations pertaining to water bodies near our florida operations we are monitoring the evolution of these proposed regulations potential costs associated with compliance cannot be determined currently and we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we contributed approximately 223 million to our us and canadian pension plans in the year ended december 31 2009 we expect to contribute approximately 96 million to our pension plans in 2010

as of december 31 2009 our other liabilities included balances related to asset retirement obligations aros and environmental remediation liabilities the estimated timing and amount of cash outflows associated with these liabilities are as follows 



1 represents the undiscounted inflationadjusted estimated cash outflows required to settle the recorded aros the corresponding present value of these future expenditures is 1037 million as of december 31 2009 we also have unrecorded aros at our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex at cfls medicine hat facility and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the 

cf industries holdings inc 

removal and disposition of certain chemical waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included is reclamation of land and in the case of donaldsonville reclamation of two effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2009 dollars is approximately 21 million currently we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities therefore the table above does not contain any cash flows for these aros see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our aros as described in financial assurance requirements we intend to set aside cash on an annual basis in an escrow account established to cover costs associated with closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems this account will be the source of a significant portion of the cash required to settle the aros pertaining to the phosphogypsum stack systems 

2 cash flows occurring after 2014 are detailed in the following table the following table details the undiscounted inflationadjusted estimated cash flows after 2014 required to settle the recorded aros as discussed above 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer and a corporate office lease the rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to seven years and the barge charter commitments currently have terms ranging from one to three years we also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements at several of our distribution locations some of which contain minimum throughput requirements the storage agreements contain minimum terms ranging from one to three years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party 

in 2006 we entered into a tenyear operating lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters located in deerfield illinois the corporate office lease agreement includes leasehold incentives rent holidays and scheduled rent increases that are expensed on a straightline basis our other operating lease agreements do not contain significant contingent rents leasehold incentives rent holidays scheduled rent increases concessions or unusual provisions see note 25 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning leases 

we do not have any other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss is transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statement of operations 

property plant and equipment 

useful lives of depreciable assets—property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation is computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction uop method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers estimates engineering or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews 

plant turnarounds—scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or buildin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is generally until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher production costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing

inventory valuation 

we review our inventory balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our initial estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation 

asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation liabilities 

asset retirement obligations aros are legal obligations associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the bartow and plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complexes land reclamation activities at our hardee florida phosphate rock mine and the cessation of operations at all of our facilities if the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated aros are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service we are required to recognize an aro for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain the obligations related to closure reclamation and cessation of operations are capitalized at their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded the liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time the asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over their estimated useful life the aggregate carrying value of all of our aros was 1037 million as of december 31 2009 and 1007 million as of december 31 2008 the increase in the aggregate carrying value of these aros is due to normal accretion expense and recognizing changes in estimates offset by cash expenditures on existing aros as previously discussed 

environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts existing technology sitespecific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations in reporting environmental liabilities no offset is made for potential recoveries all liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur in accordance with gaap environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits changes in laws regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements the amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled 62 million as of december 31 2009 and 67 million as of december 31 2008 

the actual amounts to be spent on aros and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments and cost inflation as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes we are also required to select discount rates to calculate the present value of aros changes in these estimates or the selection of a different discount rate could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

recoverability of longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries as well as other longlived assets on a regular basis in order to assess recoverability based on expected future undiscounted cash flows if the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized immediately factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume prices operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the recoverability of the values associated with our longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business 

fair value measurements 

we have classified our investments in auction rate securities as those measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 securities under the provisions of the current rules for assessing fair value see the liquidity and capital resources section of this discussion and analysis for detailed information concerning the critical accounting estimates involved in valuing and classifying these investments no other assets or liabilities are classified as level 3 items in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2009 see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning fair value measurements 

income taxes 

we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and nonoperating—net respectively 

in connection with our initial public offering ipo in august 2005 cf industries inc cfi ceased to be nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes and we entered into a net operating loss agreement nol agreement with cfis preipo owners relating to the future utilization of the preipo net operating loss carryforwards nols under the nol agreement if it is finally determined that the nols can be utilized to offset applicable postipo taxable income we will pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the utilization of nols

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 2760 million at december 31 2009 which was 425 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2009 pbo was computed based on a weighted average discount rate of 62 which was based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 192 million higher or 173 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussed the weighted average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2009 was 66 if the discount rate used to compute 2009 pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 18 million higher or 15 million lower respectively than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 70 weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2009 would have been 11 million lower or higher respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our pension plans 

retiree medical benefits 

retiree medical benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions including discount rates used to compute the present value of the future obligations and expected increases in health care costs changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs affect the recorded amount of retiree medical benefits expense 

stockbased compensation 

costs associated with stockbased compensation are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations at the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards over the service period the fair value of nonqualified stock options granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes option valuation model key assumptions used in the blackscholes option valuation model include expected volatility and expected term the weightedaverage expected volatility used to value the stock options granted in 2009 was 54 if the expected volatility was 2 higher or lower the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 29 higher or lower respectively the expected term of the stock options granted in 2009 was four to five years if the expected term was six months higher or lower the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 47 higher or lower respectively 

we accrue the cost of stockbased awards on the straightline method over the applicable vesting period as a result total compensation cost recognized for 2009 on a pretax basis was 66 million as of december 31 2009 on a pretax basis there was approximately 83 million and 37 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonqualified options and restricted stock which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 20 years respectively see note 29 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of stockbased compensation

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest as well as variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary our judgment in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our level of involvement in setting up the entity determining whether the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on our behalf determining whether we provide more than half the subordinated financial support to the entity and determining whether we absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses or returns 

we use the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions 

we eliminate from our consolidated financial results all significant intercompany transactions

discussion of seasonality impacts on operations 

our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in the valuation of our investments interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

investments in auction rate securities 

as of december 31 2009 we had 1339 million of investments in auction rate securities consisting of availableforsale tax exempt auction rate securities that were all supported by student loans that were originated primarily under the federal family education loan program due to the illiquidity in the credit markets auctions for these securities have failed as a result these investments are no longer liquid investments and we will not be able to access these funds until such time as auctions for these securities are successful buyers are found outside of the auction process andor the securities are redeemed by the issuer further details regarding these securities are included in notes 5 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources both in this form 10k 

the valuation of these securities utilizes a marktomodel approach that relies on discounted cash flows market data and inputs that are derived from similar instruments based on this valuation the unrealized holding loss against the cost basis in the investments at december 31 2009 was 45 million the unrealized holding loss has been reported in other comprehensive income and the impact of the unrealized holding loss is recorded in the net 1339 million investment balance in auction rate securities if the required rate of return we used in the calculation model was 100 basis points higher the resulting holding loss would have been approximately 8 million higher we may need to recognize either additional holding gains or losses in other comprehensive income or holding losses in net earnings should changes occur in either the conditions in the credit markets the credit quality of the issuers or in the variables considered in our valuation model 

upon a failed auction the instrument carries an interest rate based upon certain predefined formulas a 100 basis point change in the average rate of interest earned on these investments would result in a 14 million change in pretax income on an annual basis 

interest rate fluctuations 

as of december 31 2009 we had notes payable of approximately 47 million that had a floating interest rate a 100 basis point change in interest rates on our notes payable would result in a 47000 change in pretax income on an annual basis the senior secured revolving credit facility bears a current market rate of interest such that we are subject to interest rate risk on borrowings under this facility as of december 31 2009 there were no borrowings under this facility 

as of december 31 2009 we had shortterm investments of 1850 million consisting primarily of availableforsale us treasury bills with original maturity dates between three and six months a 100 basis point change in the average rate of interest earned on these shortterm investments would result in a 19 million change in pretax income on an annual basis our advances to unconsolidated affiliates consisted of floating rate subordinated debt owed to us by keytrade totaling 124 million as of december 31 2009 a 100 basis point change in interest rates on this subordinated debt would result in 124000 change in pretax earnings on an annual basis 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we are exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar as a result of our 66 economic interest and our 49 common equity interest in cfl we have made advances to cfl of 96 million 

cf industries holdings inc 

canadian dollars at the present time we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to cfl 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to fertilizer sales are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia urea and uan 28 by approximately 33 22 and 12 respectively 

we use natural gas in the manufacture of our nitrogen products because natural gas prices are volatile our natural gas acquisition policy includes the objective of providing protection against significant adverse natural gas price movements we manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering periods not exceeding three years 

the derivative instruments that we currently use are natural gas swap contracts these contracts settle using either nymex futures or aeco price indexes which represent fair value at any given time the contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods 

we recognize derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and changes in their fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the normal purchase and sale exemption applies we use natural gas derivatives primarily as an economic hedge of gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting accordingly changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities 

as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 we had open derivative contracts for 110 million mmbtus and 167 million mmbtus respectively of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2009 we used derivatives to cover approximately 38 of our natural gas consumption at donaldsonville and approximately 35 of our twothirds share of gas consumption at medicine hat an overall 100 per mmbtu change in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change the pretax unrealized marktomarket gainloss on these derivative positions by 110 million 

we purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of dap and map we attempt to include any price fluctuations related to these raw materials in our selling prices of finished products but there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered we enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices a 10 per ton change in the related cost of a ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change dap production cost by 210 per ton and 380 per ton respectively we also purchase ammonia urea and uan to augment or replace production at our facilities

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

through the end of 2002 we operated as a traditional supply cooperative our focus was on providing our preipo owners with an assured supply of fertilizer typically over 80 of our annual sales volume was to our preipo owners though important financial performance was subordinate to our mandated supply objective 

in 2002 we reassessed our corporate mission and adopted a new business model that established financial performance rather than assured supply to our preipo owners as our principal objective a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace we began to pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on financial performance one result of this approach was a substantial shift in our customer mix by 2008 our sales to customers other than our preipo owners and viterra our joint venture partner in cfl reached approximately 53 of our total sales volume for the year which was more than double the comparable percentage for 2002 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering of common stock and listing on the new york stock exchange we sold approximately 474 million shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 7154 million we did not retain any of the proceeds from the ipo in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative in the reorganization transaction our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries inc now our whollyowned subsidiary were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and approximately 76 million shares of our common stock 

operating segments 

our business is divided into two operating segments the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment the nitrogen segment includes the manufacture and sale of ammonia urea and uan the phosphate segment includes the manufacture and sale of dap map and the sale of potash 

nitrogen segment 

we are one of the leading nitrogen fertilizer producers in north america our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia urea and uan our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the following table the sales shown do not reflect amounts used internally in the 

cf industries holdings inc 

manufacture of other products for example in 2008 we used about 22 million tons of ammonia in the production of urea and uan 



1 other nitrogen segment products include aqua ammonia gross margin for the nitrogen segment was 7703 million 4468 million and 985 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

total assets for the nitrogen segment were 7582 million and 5939 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

we operate worldscale nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in donaldsonville louisiana and medicine hat alberta canada we own the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex and have a 66 economic interest in cfl a canadian joint venture that owns the medicine hat nitrogen fertilizer complex the combined production capacity of these two facilities represented approximately 20 of north american ammonia capacity 34 of north american dry urea capacity and 18 of north american uan capacity in 2008 

the following table summarizes our nitrogen fertilizer production volume for the last three years at our facilities in donaldsonville louisiana and medicine hat alberta 



1 gross ammonia production including amounts subsequently upgraded onsite into urea andor uan 2 includes total production of the donaldsonville and medicine hat facilities including the 34 interest of viterra our joint venture partner in canadian fertilizers limited donaldsonville nitrogen complex 

the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex is the largest nitrogen fertilizer production facility in north america it has four worldscale ammonia plants four urea plants and two uan plants it has the annual capacity to produce approximately 23 million tons of ammonia most of which is typically upgraded into urea and uan 26 million tons of liquid urea including amounts upgraded into uan and 27 million tons of uan measured on a 28 nitrogen content basis with the uan plants 

cf industries holdings inc 

operating at capacity approximately 17 million tons of granular urea can be produced granular urea production can be increased to 2 million tons per year if uan production is reduced 

we believe that this facility is the most versatile nitrogen fertilizer production complex in north america with multiple production units for each product the complex has considerable flexibility to adjust its product mix donaldsonville is located near the mouth of the mississippi river and has three docks that can be used simultaneously under most river conditions in addition donaldsonville is located on the union pacific railroad and a 2000mile ammonia pipeline providing us with flexible and competitively priced transportation to our inmarket nitrogen fertilizer terminals and warehouses by rail and pipeline as well as by barge the facility is capable of docking and unloading into its storage system oceangoing ship loads of ammonia and uan providing us with direct access to global suppliers the complex has onsite storage for 70000 tons of ammonia 135000 tons of uan measured on a 28 nitrogen content basis and 83000 tons of granular urea providing us with flexibility to handle temporary disruptions to shipping activities without impacting production and also flexibility to purchase and store liquid product for resale 

medicine hat nitrogen complex 

medicine hat is the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in canada it has two worldscale ammonia plants that have a combined gross annual production capacity of approximately 13 million tons and a worldscale urea plant that has a gross annual production capacity of 810000 tons the complex has onsite storage for 60000 tons of ammonia and 70000 tons of urea providing flexibility to handle temporary disruptions of outbound shipments 

the medicine hat facility is owned by cfl we own 49 of the voting common stock of cfl and 66 of cfls nonvoting preferred stock viterra owns 34 of the voting common stock and nonvoting preferred stock of cfl the remaining 17 of the voting common stock of cfl is owned by growmark inc growmark and la coop fédérée we designate four members of cfls ninemember board of directors viterra designates 3 members and growmark and la coop fédérée each designate one member cfl is a consolidated variable interest entity in our financial statements 

we operate the medicine hat facility and purchase approximately 66 of the facilitys ammonia and urea production pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either cf industries inc or cfl upon a twelvemonth notice viterra has the right but not the obligation to purchase the remaining 34 of the facilitys ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement to the extent that viterra does not purchase its 34 of the facilitys production we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts since 1995 however viterra or its predecessor has purchased at least 34 of the facilitys production each year 

under the product purchase agreements both we and viterra pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases however the product purchase agreements also provide that cfl will distribute its net earnings to viterra and us annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from cfl our product purchase agreement also requires us to advance funds to cfl in the event that cfl is unable to meet its debts as they become due the amount of each advance would be at least 66 of the deficiency and would be more in any year in which we purchased more than 66 of medicine hats production a similar obligation also exists for viterra we and viterra currently manage cfl such that each party is responsible for its share of cfls fixed costs and cfls production volume is managed to meet the parties combined requirements the management 

cf industries holdings inc 

agreement the product purchase agreements and any other agreements related to cfl are subject to change with the consent of both parties 

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material as well as the primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at both the donaldsonville and the medicine hat facilities in 2008 our natural gas purchases accounted for approximately 56 of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization donaldsonville is located in close proximity to one of the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america known as the henry hub medicine hat is located in close proximity to one of the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in canada known as aeco 

we use a combination of spot and term purchases of varied duration from a variety of suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced natural gas supply in addition we use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices 

in 2008 the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex consumed approximately 78 million mmbtus of natural gas the facility has access to five natural gas pipelines and obtains gas from several suppliers in 2008 the largest individual supplier provided approximately 54 of the donaldsonville facilitys total gas requirement the medicine hat complex consumed approximately 41 million mmbtus of natural gas in 2008 the facility has access to two natural gas pipelines and obtains gas from numerous suppliers the largest of which supplied approximately 27 of the gas consumed in 2008 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex which is located on the mississippi river includes a deepwater docking facility access to an ammonia shipping pipeline and truck and railroad loading capabilities we ship our share of ammonia and urea produced at the medicine hat nitrogen fertilizer complex by truck and rail to customers in the united states and canada and to our storage facilities in the northern united states 

ammonia urea and uan from donaldsonville can be loaded into river barges and oceangoing vessels for direct shipment to domestic customers for transport to storage facilities or for export we own six ammonia river barges with a total capacity of approximately 16400 tons we contract on a dedicated basis for tug services and the operation of these barges we have 20 uan river barges contracted on a dedicated basis with a total capacity of approximately 60000 tons additional ammonia and uan barge capacity is contracted for as needed river transportation for urea is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators 

the donaldsonville facility is connected to a 2000mile long ammonia pipeline used by several nitrogen producers to transport ammonia to over 20 terminals and shipping points located in the midwestern us cornbelt we are a major customer of this ammonia pipeline in 2008 approximately 63 of our ammonia shipments from our donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex were transported via the ammonia pipeline 

we also transport substantial volumes of urea and uan from the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex and ammonia and urea from the medicine hat nitrogen fertilizer complex by rail in addition to using rail cars provided by the rail carriers as of december 31 2008 we had leases in place for approximately 600 ammonia tank cars 1100 uan tank cars and 600 dry product hopper cars

phosphate segment 

we are a major manufacturer of phosphate fertilizer products our main phosphate fertilizer products are dap and map we have also started to purchase potash fertilizer to be resold from our midwest market distribution facilities sales of potash are expected to commence in the spring 2009 season potash results are included in the phosphate segment 

our historical sales of phosphate fertilizer products are shown in the table below 



gross margin for the phosphate segment was 4524 million 2232 million and 487 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

total assets for the phosphate segment were 7641 million and 4935 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

our phosphate fertilizer manufacturing operations are located in central florida and consist of a phosphate fertilizer chemical complex in plant city and a phosphate rock mine a beneficiation plant and phosphate rock reserves in hardee county we own each of these facilities and properties 

the following table summarizes our phosphate fertilizer production volumes for the last three years and current production capacities for phosphaterelated products

hardee county phosphate rock mine 

in 1975 we purchased 20000 acres of land in hardee county florida that was originally estimated to contain in excess of 100 million tons of recoverable rock reserves between 1978 and mid1993 we operated a one million ton per year phosphate rock mine on a 5000acre portion of these reserves 

in 1992 we initiated a project to expand and relocate mining operations to the remaining 15000acre area of the reserve property the new phosphate rock mine cost 135 million and began operations in late 1995 in 1997 we added approximately 20 million tons to our reserve base through an exchange with a neighboring rock producer in 1999 we acquired 1400 acres containing an estimated 8 million tons of rock reserves in 2008 we acquired approximately 800 acres of land containing an estimated 16 million tons of rock reserves 

the table below shows the estimated reserves at the hardee phosphate complex as of december 31 2008 also reflected in the table is the grade of the reserves expressed as a percentage of bone phosphate of lime bpl and p 2 o 5  finally the table also reflects the average values of the following material contaminants contained in the reserves ferrous oxide fe 2 o 3  plus aluminum oxide al 2 o 3  and magnesium oxide mgo

bartow phosphate complex 

we own a former phosphate manufacturing complex in bartow florida that ceased production in 1999 the site contains the former manufacturing facilities storage and distribution facilities and the phosphogypsum stack system in 2007 we sold the storage and distribution facilities along with approximately 35 acres of land and are currently dismantling the manufacturing facilities in accordance with local laws and regulations we continue to be obligated for the closure of the phosphogypsum stack system management of water treatment on the site and providing longterm care for the site 

phosphate raw materials 

phosphate rock supply phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers approximately 35 tons of phosphate rock are needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5 the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex consumes in excess of three million tons of rock annually as of december 31 2008 our hardee rock mine had approximately 14 years of fullypermitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our hardee property where we can mine the expanded area has an estimated 33 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves we estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately nine additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area 

sulfur supply sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid approximately threequarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5 our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 800000 long tons of sulfur annually when operating at capacity we obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration in 2008 martin sulphur our largest molten sulfur supplier supplied approximately 56 of the molten sulfur used at plant city 

ammonia supply dap and map have a nitrogen content of 18 and 11 respectively and a phosphate nutrient content of 46 and 52 respectively ammonia is the primary source of nitrogen in dap and map operating at capacity our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex consumes approximately 400000 tons of ammonia annually 

the ammonia used at our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia storage facility located in tampa florida this facility acquired in 1992 consists of a 38000ton ammonia storage tank access to a deepwater dock that is capable of discharging oceangoing vessels and rail and truckloading facilities in addition to supplying our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex our tampa ammonia distribution system has the capacity to support ammonia sales to and distribution services for other customers sales of ammonia from our tampa terminal are reported in our nitrogen business segment the ammonia supply for tampa is purchased from offshore sources providing us with access to the broad international ammonia market 

phosphate distribution 

we operate a phosphate warehouse located at a deepwater port facility in tampa florida most of the phosphate fertilizer produced at plant city is shipped by truck or rail to our tampa warehouse where it is loaded onto vessels for shipment to export customers or for transport across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river in 2008 our tampa warehouse handled approximately 12 million tons of phosphate fertilizers or about 61 of our production the remainder of our phosphate fertilizer production is transported by truck or rail directly to customers or to inmarket storage facilities 

cf industries holdings inc 

phosphate fertilizer shipped across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river is transferred into river barges near new orleans phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is transported to our storage facilities or delivered directly to customers river transportation is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators 

storage facilities and other properties 

we currently own or rent space at 39 inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 14state region including storage at our production facilities and at the tampa warehouse and ammonia terminal we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately two million tons of fertilizer our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table

competition 

our markets are intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

in our nitrogen segment our primary north americanbased competitors are agrium koch nitrogen and terra industries there is also significant competition from product sourced from regions of the world with low natural gas costs because urea is a widelytraded fertilizer product and there are limited barriers to entry competition from foreignsourced product is particularly acute with respect to urea 

in our phosphate segment our primary north americanbased competitors are agrium mosaic potash corp and simplot historically imports have not been a factor as the united states is a large net exporter of phosphate fertilizers 

seasonality 

the sales patterns of all five of our major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns

environment health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes violations can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment 

cf industries holdings inc 

we have received notices from time to time from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws we are currently involved in remediation activities at certain of our current and former facilities we are also participating in the cleanup of thirdparty sites at which we have disposed of wastes in april 2002 we were asked by the current owner of a former phosphate mine and processing facility that we operated in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho to contribute to a remediation of this property we declined to participate in the cleanup in january 2009 we were again asked to participate in the remediation of the property it is our understanding that the current owner signed a consent judgment with the idaho department of environmental quality ideq for cleanup of the processing portion of the site and has submitted a draft remedial action plan that is under review by the ideq and related agencies we anticipate that the current owner may bring a lawsuit against us seeking contribution for the cleanup costs although we do not have sufficient information to determine when such a suit may be brought we are not able to estimate at this time our potential liability if any with respect to the remediation of this property based on currently available information we do not expect that any remedial or financial obligations we may be subject to involving this or other sites will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2004 and january 2005 the united states environmental protection agency epa inspected our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex to evaluate the facilitys compliance with rcra the federal statute that governs the generation transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous wastes by letter dated september 27 2005 epa region iv issued to the company a notice of violation nov and compliance evaluation inspection report the nov and compliance evaluation inspection report alleged a number of violations of rcra including violations relating to recordkeeping the failure to properly make hazardous waste determinations as required by rcra and alleged treatment of sulfuric acid waste without a permit the most significant allegation in the nov is that the plant city facilitys reuse of phosphoric acid process water which is otherwise exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste in the production of ammoniated phosphate fertilizer and the return of this process water to the facilitys process water recirculating system has resulted in the disposal of hazardous waste into the system without a permit the compliance evaluation inspection report indicates that as a result the entire process water system including all pipes cooling ponds and gypsum stacks could be regulated as hazardous waste management units under rcra if the epas position is eventually upheld the company could incur material expenditures in order to modify its practices or it may be required to comply with regulations applicable to hazardous waste treatment storage or disposal facilities this would cause a significant disruption of the operations of the plant city facility the company has conducted a successful pilot test to eliminate the use of process water in the ammoniated phosphate fertilizer scrubbers although this does not fully resolve the nov or address all of the issues identified by the epa and department of justice this does address a significant issue identified in the nov the epa has referred the matter to the department of justice for enforcement for additional information see item 3 legal proceedings 

we expect continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future investments for environmental controls at our ongoing operations our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2008 were approximately 56 million we estimate that we will spend approximately 14 million in 2009 for environmental health and safety capital expenditures environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example there is increasing government and public emphasis on the impact of carbon emissions on the environment and various taxes limits or caps have been proposed on carbon emissions like other fertilizer and chemical producers our plants emit carbon dioxide as part of the manufacturing process we may be required to incur additional expenditures to

comply with new environmental health and safety laws and regulations and any such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we hold numerous environmental and mining permits authorizing operations at our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals 

as of december 31 2008 the area permitted for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 50 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current production rates for approximately 14 years we have secured the necessary permits to mine these reserves from the florida department of environmental protection and the us army corps of engineers we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated additional 33 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately nine additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area the estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective of the anticipated permittable mining areas based on recent similar permitting efforts in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

likewise our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2014 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits we have secured the local development authorization to increase the capacity of this stack system based on this authorization estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately eight years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in certain cases as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure the government that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities in march 2006 we established an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection as a means of taking advantage of a safe harbor provision in a 2005 amendment to floridas regulations pertaining to financial assurance requirements for the closure of phosphogypsum stacks for additional information on the cash deposit arrangement see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements note 11—asset retirement obligations 

several of our permits including our mining permit at the hardee phosphate complex require us to reclaim any property disturbed by our operations at our hardee property we currently mine approximately 300 to 400 acres of land each year all of which must be reclaimed the costs to reclaim this land vary based on the type of land involved and range from 3200 to 17200 an acre with an

 item 1a risk factors 

  our business is subject to a number of risks if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is dependent on the price of natural gas in north america which is both relatively expensive and highly volatile 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea and uan because all of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses expenditures on natural gas comprised approximately 56 of the total cost of our nitrogen fertilizer sales in 2008 and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization 

the market price for natural gas in north america is significantly higher than the price of natural gas in certain other major fertilizerproducing regions many of our competitors benefit from access to lowerpriced natural gas through manufacturing facilities or interests in manufacturing facilities located in these regions or other regions with abundant supplies of natural gas many of these facilities are exportoriented and their owners actively ship product to north america which is our primary market for nitrogen based fertilizers 

the price of natural gas in north america is also highly volatile during 2008 the median daily price at henry hub ranged from a low of 5375 per mmbtu on december 24 2008 to a high of 1332 per mmbtu on july 3 2008 the volatility of the price of natural gas in north america compounds our disadvantage to some of our competitors in addition to having access to lowerpriced natural gas these competitors may also benefit from fixedprice natural gas contracts some of which may be linked directly to the market price of the nitrogen fertilizer being manufactured given the volatility of pricing and our dependence on north american natural gas the price we pay for natural gas may be higher than certain other fertilizerproducing regions of the world which may make it more difficult for us to compete against these producers we may not be able to pass along the resulting higher operating costs to our customers in the form of higher product prices if market prices are below our cost of production due to the high cost of natural gas we may shift our sourcing of nitrogen fertilizers from manufactured to purchased products during late 2005 and early 2006 we curtailed production of fertilizers at our donaldsonville complex for this reason 

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our results of operations tend to be negatively impacted 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by population growth changes in dietary habits nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels and planted acreage and application rates among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs government policies and global trade 

periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in new plant investment and increased production causing supply to exceed demand and prices and capacity utilization to decline in particular new ammonia and urea capacity is expected to be added abroad in lowcost regions future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to alleviate any existing or future conditions of excess industry capacity 

cf industries holdings inc 

during periods of industry oversupply our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory lower production of our products andor possible plant closures 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities 

recent consolidation in the fertilizer industry has increased the resources of several of our competitors and we expect consolidation among fertilizer producers to continue in light of this industry consolidation our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships in the future we may not be able to find suitable assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities we may not be able to acquire desired assets or enter into desired joint ventures or partnerships on economically acceptable terms our inability to compete successfully could result in the loss of customers which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

china is the worlds largest producer and consumer of fertilizers and is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may face increased competition from russian and ukrainian urea which is currently subject to antidumping duty orders that impose significant duties on urea imported into the united states from these two countries the antidumping orders have been in place since 1987 and there has been almost no urea imported into the united states from russia or ukraine since that time russia and ukraine currently have considerable capacity to produce urea and are the worlds largest urea exporters producers in russia where the price for gas is well below its market value benefit from natural gas prices that are government controlled encouraging inefficient urea production and exports following a sunset review by the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission itc the antidumping orders were extended for an additional fiveyear period in november 2005 in june 2008 the itcs determination was upheld by the us court of international trade this order is not scheduled to undergo the next sunset review until december 2010 in addition one large russian producer the eurochem group eurochem requested the department of commerce to review its sales and costs in order to establish a new antidumping duty rate specifically for them in may 2008 the department of commerce issued a final decision in that review and found that eurochems reviewed russian urea exports were priced fairly as a result unless a future review finds the eurochems unfair pricing has resumed no antidumping duties will apply to its russian urea exports to the united states while all other russian urea producers continue to be subject to antidumping duties the elimination of antidumping duties on eurochems russian urea may result in a significant increase in eurochems urea exports to the united states

any decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products 

conditions in the us agricultural industry can significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices the domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products 

state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications for example in recent years ethanol production in the us has increased significantly due in part to federal legislation mandating greater use of renewable fuels this increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the us and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuels standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a growing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to reduce subsidies for ethanol allow increased ethanol imports and adopt temporary waivers to the current rfs levels any of which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition several states are currently considering limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products 

weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our products 

adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers 

our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

if seasonal demand exceeds our projections our customers may acquire products from our competitors and our profitability will be negatively impacted if seasonal demand is less than we expect we will be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively impacted by any related storage costs andor liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with 

cf industries holdings inc 

excess inventory and product shortages are particularly acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the highly volatile cost of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers 

our customer base is concentrated with certain large customers accounting for a substantial portion of our sales 

during 2008 three customers chs inc growmark inc and gavilon fertilizer llc previously conagra international fertilizer company made combined fertilizer purchases of approximately 15267 million from us representing approximately 39 of our total net sales because we depend on these customers for a significant portion of our sales we may have less flexibility than some of our competitors to diversify our customer base and seek more profitable direct sales to customers of our significant customers any substantial change in purchasing decisions by any or all of these customers whether due to actions by our competitors our actions in expanding the direct sale of fertilizers to the customers of our significant customers or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a change in the use of the forward pricing program by our customers could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our operating results liquidity and financial condition 

in mid2003 we implemented a forward pricing program fpp through our fpp we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose this improves our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product allows us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing assets 

as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we generally use natural gas derivatives or fixed price fertilizer purchase contracts to hedge against changes in the price of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our supply cost fixing the selling prices of our products under our fpp often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment additionally the use of derivatives to lock in the majority of our margins on fpp sales of nitrogen products can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives prior to the purchase of the natural gas 

we are also exposed to losses in the event of default by derivative counterparties or to changes in our working capital and liquidity in the event of significant margin calls or losses on the derivative portfolio 

under our fpp customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date thereby significantly increasing our liquidity any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with the fpp are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months or more as of december 31 2008 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders under the fpp equaled approximately 56 of our cash and cash equivalents 

we believe the fpp is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices for example in late 2005 a period during which prices for nitrogen fertilizer products reached then record high levels our orders under the fpp declined significantly as our 

cf industries holdings inc 

customers and their customers preferred to defer purchases of fertilizer products rather than commit to purchasing products at such high prices sales under the fpp were lower during 2006 a period of relatively high fertilizer prices compared to 2005 with forward sales of nitrogen fertilizer products declining from approximately 70 of our nitrogen fertilizer volume during 2005 to approximately 44 in 2006 conversely our customers may also be more willing to increase their use of fpp during periods of rapidly rising fertilizer prices as was the case in late 2007 and much of 2008 during this period of rapidly increasing nitrogen fertilizer prices forward sales of nitrogen fertilizer products increased under the program to approximately 66 of our nitrogen fertilizer volume in 2007 and 74 in 2008 in environments such as this our profit margins may be lower than if we had not sold our nitrogen fertilizers under the fpp 

the fpp is also less effective at reducing our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins in circumstances where we purchase the fertilizer product from third parties for resale rather than manufacture the product at one of our facilities for example due to the high cost of natural gas in north america in late 2005 we decided to curtail production at our facilities and increase our purchases of fertilizer products originating from offshore lower cost producers for resale to our customers because it is generally not feasible to purchase fertilizer products from these third parties on a forward basis or match purchased quantities with specific order quantities we may not be able to fix our profit margins effectively on fertilizer products that we buy for resale under our fpp one method we use to reduce our margin exposure on sales of purchased products under the program is to purchase the required fertilizer products in advance of the specified delivery date however in such circumstances we may be required to buy and store the product sooner and in greater quantities than if produced thereby reducing the liquidity benefits otherwise associated with the fpp it also may not be feasible to purchase sufficient quantities of fertilizer in advance of the specified delivery dates at known acceptable prices thereby reducing or eliminating the expected margins associated with the forward sales an increase in our purchases of fertilizer products for resale to our customers may increase our exposure to fluctuating profit margins on the purchased products and could have a material adverse affect on our operating results liquidity and financial condition 

we also sell phosphate products through our fpp in 2008 forward sales of phosphate fertilizer products represented approximately 61 of our phosphate fertilizer volume compared with 42 of our phosphate fertilizer volume in 2007 and 14 in 2006 similar to nitrogen sales phosphate sales under the fpp increased significantly in both 2007 and the first half of 2008 during a period of rapidly rising fertilizer prices unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products where we effectively fix the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate fertilizer costs as a result we are typically exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis 

our operations are reliant on a limited number of key facilities that involve significant risks and hazards against which we may not be fully insured 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and they may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities for example over the course of the past few years we have been involved in numerous property damage and personal injury lawsuits arising out of a hydrogen explosion at our donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer 

cf industries holdings inc 

complex in 2000 in which three people died and several others were injured we were also involved in personal injury lawsuits arising out of a train derailment near minot north dakota in 2002 that ruptured five tank cars causing the formation of an ammonia cloud over the area in which one person died and numerous others were injured 

our exposure to these types of risks is increased because of our reliance on a limited number of key facilities our nitrogen fertilizer operations are dependent on our nitrogen fertilizer complex in donaldsonville louisiana and our joint ventures nitrogen fertilizer complex in medicine hat alberta our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on our phosphate mine and associated beneficiation plant in hardee county florida our phosphate fertilizer complex in plant city florida and our ammonia terminal in tampa florida any suspension of operations at any of these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products fulfill our commitments under our forward pricing program and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition all of these facilities other than the complex in medicine hat are located in regions of the united states that experience a relatively high level of hurricane activity such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas and sulfur in the gulf region 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we are subject to various selfretentions and deductibles under these insurance policies as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 

we rely on third party providers of transportation services and equipment which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations 

we rely on railroad trucking pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars from rail car owners in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including extreme weather conditions work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of our raw materials or finished products 

the us railroad industry is requesting regulations to shift certain liabilities to shippers for the movement of certain hazardous materials this request applies to a number of materials including anhydrous ammonia which we ship to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities these proposed regulations would require us to indemnify or provide supplemental insurance to the railroads for damages above a stated threshold stemming from any release of the toxic materials regardless of fault any transfer of the railroads liability to us or requirement to provide supplemental insurance could be a significant potential liability for us or could impact our ability to transport this product 

if we are delayed or unable to ship our finished products or obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are 

cf industries holdings inc 

significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our sales revenues andor cost of operations could be adversely affected 

new regulations could also be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products the us railroad industry is proposing higher ammonia tank car performance standards which could require the modification or replacement of our leased tank car fleet these higher standards could impact our ability to obtain an adequate supply of rail cars to support our operations 

expansion of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences 

we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both domestically and in certain foreign locations acquisitions partnerships joint ventures and other major investments require significant managerial resources which may be diverted from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses 

international acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures or the international expansion of our business involve additional risks and uncertainties including 

• difficulties and costs of complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations • unexpected changes in regulatory environments • political and economic instability including the possibility for civil unrest • nationalization of properties by foreign governments • tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements • the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions and • the impact of exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and foreign currencies in the countries where we operate furthermore acquisitions of businesses or facilities entail a number of additional risks including 

• problems with effective integration of operations • the inability to maintain key preacquisition business relationships • loss of key personnel of businesses we acquire or invest in • exposure to unanticipated liabilities and • difficulties in realizing efficiencies synergies and cost savings these risks of unanticipated adverse consequences from any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented we also face increased exposure to risks related to acquisitions and international operations because our experience with acquisitions and international operations is limited as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other investments 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the united states and canada including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of 

cf industries holdings inc 

hazardous substance releases these laws include the clean air act the clean water act rcra cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes 

as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations additionally future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or more vigorous enforcement of current laws and regulations whether caused by violations of environmental and health and safety laws by us or other chemical fertilizer companies or otherwise may require us to make substantial expenditures additionally our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

see item 1 business—environmental health and safety and item 3 legal proceedings for additional information on our environmental and legal matters 

our operations are dependent on numerous required permits approvals and financial assurance requirements from governmental authorities 

we hold numerous environmental mining and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion of our operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in certain cases as a condition to procure such permits and approvals or as a condition to maintain existing approvals we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure local state or federal government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities in march 2006 we established an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection as a means of taking advantage of a safe harbor provision in a 2005 amendment to floridas regulations pertaining to financial assurance requirements for the closure of phosphogypsum stacks florida regulations also mandate payment of certain mining taxes based on the quantity of ore mined and are subject to change based on local regulatory approvals additional financial assurance requirements or other increases in local mining regulations and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted we will be required to 

cf industries holdings inc 

demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities the demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds letters of credit insurance policies or similar instruments it is possible that we will not be able to comply with either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2008 the area permitted by local state and federal authorities for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 50 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current operating rates for approximately 14 years we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated 33 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately nine additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

likewise our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2014 at current operating rates and is subject to regular renewals of our operating permits we have secured the local development authorization to increase the capacity of this stack system based on this authorization estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately eight years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

acts of terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities our plants and ancillary facilities may be targets of terrorist activities many of these plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other items that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations impacting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues andor reduced profit margins 

our operations are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and an increase in the price or any delay or interruption in the delivery of these raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas ammonia and sulfur as raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase these raw materials from thirdparty suppliers prices for these raw materials can fluctuate 

cf industries holdings inc 

significantly due to changes in supply and demand we may not be able to pass along to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business these products are transported by barge truck rail or pipeline to our facilities by thirdparty transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw materials including those caused by capacity constraints explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving pipelines deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime or labor difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our investments in securities are subject to risks that may result in losses 

we invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us government those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities our investments are subject to fluctuations in both market value and yield based upon changes in market conditions including interest rates liquidity general economic and credit market conditions and conditions specific to the issuers 

at december 31 2008 we held investments of 1778 million in taxexempt auction rate securities these securities were issued by various state and local government entities and are all supported by student loans that were primarily issued under the federal family loan program the underlying securities have stated maturities that range up to 39 years and are guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities in february 2008 the market for these securities began to show signs of illiquidity and auctions for several securities failed on their scheduled auction dates as a result we continue to hold investments in certain of these securities these investments for which auctions have failed are no longer liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until such time as an auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 

due to the risks of investments we may not achieve expected returns or may realize losses on our investments which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

the loss of key members of our management and professional staff may adversely affect our business 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our senior management and professional staff the loss of one or more key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally if we are unable to find hire and retain needed key personnel in the future our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

global market and economic conditions including those related to the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a general slowdown in economic activity caused by the current recession could adversely affect our business in the following ways a worsening of the current credit markets could impact the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital the failure of certain key suppliers or derivative counterparties could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses and the continuation of both the volatility of interest rates and negative market returns could result in increased expense and greater contributions to our defined benefit plans

environmental 

in december 2004 and january 2005 the united states environmental protection agency epa inspected our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex to evaluate the facilitys compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the federal statute that governs the generation transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous wastes this inspection was undertaken as a part of a broad enforcement initiative commenced by the epa to evaluate whether mineral processing and mining facilities including in particular all wet process phosphoric acid production facilities are in compliance with rcra and the extent to which such facilities waste management practices have impacted the environment 

by letter dated september 27 2005 epa region 4 issued to the company a notice of violation nov and compliance evaluation inspection report the nov and compliance evaluation inspection report alleged a number of violations of rcra including violations relating to recordkeeping the failure to properly make hazardous waste determinations as required by rcra and alleged treatment of sulfuric acid waste without a permit the most significant allegation in the nov is that the plant city facilitys reuse of phosphoric acid process water which is otherwise exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste in the production of ammoniated phosphate fertilizer and the return of this process water to the facilitys process water recirculating system have resulted in the disposal of hazardous waste into the system without a permit the compliance evaluation inspection report indicates that as a result the entire process water system including all pipes ditches cooling ponds and gypsum stacks could be regulated as hazardous waste management units under rcra 

several of our competitors have received novs making this same allegation this particular recycling of process water is common in the industry and the company believes was authorized by the epa in 1990 the company also believes that this allegation is inconsistent with recent case law governing the scope of the epas regulatory authority under rcra nonetheless the company has conducted a successful pilot test to replace process water as a scrubbing medium at the ammonium phosphate fertilizer plants and maintain compliance with plant citys air permit the company has 

cf industries holdings inc 

received a permit from the florida department of environmental protection that authorizes the company to make this change for the three ammonium phosphate plants that utilize process water although this does not fully resolve the nov or address all of the issues identified by the epa and department of justice this does address a significant issue identified in the nov 

the nov indicated that the company is liable for penalties up to the statutory maximum for example the statutory maximum per day of noncompliance for each violation that occurred after march 15 2004 is 32500 per day although penalties of this magnitude are rarely if ever imposed the company is at risk of incurring substantial civil penalties with respect to these allegations the epa has referred this matter to the united states department of justice doj for enforcement the company has entered into discussions with the doj that have included not only the issues identified in the nov but other operational practices of the company and its competitors the company does not know if this matter will be resolved prior to the commencement of litigation by the united states 

in connection with the rcra enforcement initiative the epa collected samples of soil groundwater and various waste streams at the plant city facility the analysis of the split samples collected by the company during the epas inspection did not identify hazardous waste disposal issues impacting the site the epas sampling results appear to be consistent with the companys own sampling results pursuant to a 1992 consent order with the state of florida the company captures and reuses groundwater that has been impacted as a result of the former operation of an unlined gypsum stack at the site the company has recently conducted an additional limited amount of sampling at the plant city facility pursuant to a work plan agreed to with the epa and is planning to submit a report to the epa documenting the results of this sampling by march 2009 subject to the epas review of these results the company does not believe that further investigation will be required 

on march 19 2007 the company received a letter from the epa under section 114 of the federal clean air act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with new source review new source performance standards and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants at the plant city facility the company responded to this letter with the information requested completing the document production process in late 2007 the epa initiated this same process in relation to numerous other sulfuric acid plants and phosphoric acid plants throughout the nation including other facilities in florida in some cases the epa filed enforcement proceedings asserting that the facilities had not complied with the clean air act to date these enforcement proceedings have been resolved through settlements it is not known at this time whether the epa will initiate enforcement with respect to the plant city facility

our company 

we are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products in north america our operations are organized into two business segments the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment our principal products in the nitrogen segment are ammonia urea and urea ammonium nitrate solution or uan our principal products in the phosphate segment are diammonium phosphate or dap monoammonium phosphate or map and granular muriate of potash or potash for the twelve months ended june 30 2007 the most recent period for which such information is available we supplied approximately 22 of the nitrogen and approximately 14 of the phosphate used in agricultural fertilizer applications in the united states according to the association of american plant food control officials our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern us grainproducing states our principal customers are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors 

our principal assets include 

• the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in north america donaldsonville louisiana • a 66 economic interest in the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in canada which we operate in medicine hat alberta through canadian fertilizers limited or cfl a consolidated variable interest entity • one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer complexes in the united states plant city florida 33 

cf industries holdings inc 

• the mostrecently constructed phosphate rock mine and associated beneficiation plant in the united states hardee county florida • an extensive system of terminals warehouses and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern united states and • a 50 interest in keytrade ag keytrade a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near zurich switzerland which we account for as an equity method investment financial executive summary 

• we reported net earnings of 6846 million in 2008 compared to net earnings of 3727 million in 2007 reflecting the impact of a strong pricing environment for our products our results for 2008 included a net pretax unrealized marktomarket loss of 638 million 411 million after tax on natural gas derivatives in our nitrogen segment and a 570 million 367 million after tax noncash inventory valuation charge in our phosphate segment net earnings of 3727 million in 2007 included a net 170 million pretax unrealized marktomarket gain 110 million after tax on natural gas derivatives • our gross margin increased by 5527 million to 12227 million in 2008 compared to 6700 million in 2007 the increase in gross margin resulted mainly from higher average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices partially offset by higher phosphate raw material costs higher realized natural gas costs increased purchased product costs as well as unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives and valuation charges to phosphate and potash inventories • our net sales increased 42 to 39 billion in 2008 compared to 28 billion in 2007 the increase reflected higher average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices offset slightly by lower nitrogen and phosphate sales volume total sales volume was 79 million tons in 2008 as compared to 89 million tons in 2007 • cash flow from operations decreased 515 million to 6386 million in 2008 due primarily to cash used to support an increase in inventory that more than offset improved operating results • as of december 31 2008 we had cash and cash equivalents of 6250 million 1778 million of illiquid investments in auction rate securities and a 3478 million current liability attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under our fpp as of december 31 2007 we had cash and cash equivalents of 3665 million short term investments mainly auction rate securities of 4945 million and customer advances of 3058 million respectively • we paid cash dividends of 220 million in 2008 an increase of 175 million from 2007 due to an increase of the quarterly dividend to 010 per common share from 002 per common share • on august 30 2008 we implemented an orderly shutdown of our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex in anticipation of hurricane gustav which struck the region on september 1 2008 although the donaldsonville complex suffered only minor damage the hurricane caused substantial damage to the electrical power distribution system in the region causing the complex to be without power until september 8 2008 production units were brought back online progressively and all production units were operational by september 24 2008 total lost production as a result of the storm consisted of about 40000 shippable tons of ammonia 100000 tons of urea and 31000 tons of uan 28 solution this production disruption did not impact our ability to meet our sales commitments the cost of repairs and incremental expenses was approximately 5 million which was charged to cost of sales mainly in the third quarter 34 

cf industries holdings inc 

additionally approximately 7 million of fixed overhead costs at the donaldsonville complex were charged directly to cost of sales due to the shutdown 

• during the fourth quarter of 2008 we repurchased and retired 85 million shares of our common stock for approximately 500 million at an average price of 5896 per share under a program authorized by our board of directors company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

through the end of 2002 we operated as a traditional supply cooperative our focus was on providing our preipo owners with an assured supply of fertilizer typically over 80 of our annual sales volume was to our preipo owners though important financial performance was subordinate to our mandated supply objective 

in 2002 we reassessed our corporate mission and adopted a new business model that established financial performance rather than assured supply to our preipo owners as our principal objective a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace under the new business model we began to pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on financial performance one result of this approach was a substantial shift in our customer mix by 2008 our sales to customers other than our preipo owners and viterra inc formerly westco our joint venture partner in cfl reached approximately 53 of our total sales volume for the year which was more than double the comparable percentage for 2002 

cf holdings was formed as a delaware corporation in april 2005 to hold the existing businesses of cf industries inc on august 16 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock we sold approximately 474 million shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 7154 million we did not retain any of the proceeds from our ipo in connection with our ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction in which cf industries inc ceased to be a cooperative and became our whollyowned subsidiary in the reorganization transaction all of the equity interests in cf industries inc were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the ipo and approximately 76 million shares of our common stock 

significant items 

during 2008 the nitrogen and phosphate segments experienced record high selling prices due to favorable supply and demand balances until the fourth quarter when sharply reduced fertilizer demand significantly impacted nitrogen and phosphate selling prices factors leading to reduced demand included poor weather in north america declining crop prices and reduced credit availability consolidated net sales increased by 11 billion or 42 to 39 billion in 2008 with increases due to higher average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments gross margin increased by 5527 million in 2008 our 2008 gross margin included a 638 million pretax unrealized marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives in 2008 we began staging purchased potash fertilizer in our distribution network and expect to commence sales in the spring season of 2009 the potash results 

cf industries holdings inc 

are included in the phosphate segment during the fourth quarter we recorded a 570 million pretax 367 million after tax noncash charge to write down our phosphate 303 million and potash 267 million inventories as the carrying cost exceeded the estimated net realizable values 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we repurchased and retired 85 million shares of our common stock for approximately 500 million at an average price of 5896 per share under a program authorized by our board of directors 

both the nitrogen and phosphate segments in 2007 were favorably impacted by improved demand and pricing as a robust agricultural economy characterized by strong domestic and international grain markets produced high global demand for fertilizer increasing demand pushed average selling prices higher as the year progressed consolidated net sales increased by 7238 million or 36 to 28 billion in 2007 with increases in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments gross margin increased by 5228 million in 2007 our 2007 gross margin included a 170 million pretax unrealized marktomarket gain on natural gas derivatives 

keytrade is a reseller of fertilizer products that it purchases from various manufacturers around the world and resells in approximately 50 countries through a network of seven offices during 2007 we purchased a 50 voting interest in keytrade for 259 million under this arrangement we utilize keytrade as our exclusive exporter of phosphate fertilizer products from north america and keytrade is our exclusive importer of uan products into north america we also provided 137 million in a combination of subordinated financing for keytrade under notes that will mature in september 2017 and preferred stock we report keytrade as an equity method investment 

we periodically review the depreciable lives assigned to our production facilities and related assets as well as estimated production capacities used to develop our unitsofproduction uop depreciation expense and we change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews in the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed such a review and as a result we increased the depreciable lives of certain assets at our nitrogen production facilities from ten years to fifteen years separately we revised the estimates of production capacities for certain uop assets at our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex and all uop assets at our plant city florida phosphate complex the effect of this change in estimate for the twelve months ended december 31 2007 was an increase in earnings before income taxes of 103 million an increase in net earnings of 67 million and an increase in diluted earnings per share of 012 

the domestic nitrogen segment in 2006 was affected by adverse conditions early in the year due to the remaining impacts from the 2005 hurricane season and its impact on natural gas pricing due to damage experienced by gulf of mexico gas producers later in the year natural gas prices fell and a tight international market for fertilizer products and an expectation of a stronger planting season in early 2007 led to a stabilization in overall pricing results for our phosphate business in 2006 were impacted favorably by increased domestic demand and stable international conditions consolidated net sales increased 650 million or 33 in 2006 to 20 billion with increases in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments gross margin declined by 620 million or 30 to 1472 million our 2006 gross margin was impacted by a 307 million pretax charge for unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives and a pretax charge of 216 million for adjustments to asset retirement obligations aros and demolition costs primarily related to our closed bartow florida complex late in 2006 management committed to a plan to relocate its corporate office to deerfield illinois the move was completed in the first quarter of 2007

key industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply  demand 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key consumingexporting countries such as china india or brazil often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs government policies and global trade 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea and uan because all of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses expenditures on natural gas comprised approximately 56 of the total cost of our nitrogen fertilizer sales in 2008 and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization 

farmers economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns and the types of crops planted fertilizer demand has increased in response to increased corn acreage planted to support the growing ethanol industry 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters changes in currency values alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east the former soviet union the republic of trinidad and tobago and venezuela are major exporters to north america 

cf industries holdings inc 

the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer andor trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations 

political and social government policies 

the political and social policies of governments around the world can result in the restriction of imports the subsidization of domestic producers andor the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives 

factors affecting our results 

net sales our net sales are derived from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers 

cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs product purchases and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials maintenance direct labor and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

in 2003 we instituted a margin risk management approach utilizing our forward pricing program fpp which allows us to manage some of the risks created by the volatility of fertilizer prices and natural gas costs through our fpp we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost using natural gas derivative instruments see forward pricing program later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products under our fpp often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

selling general and administrative expenses our selling general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees our selling general and administrative expenses have increased as a result of the consummation of our ipo these expenses include additional legal and corporate governance expenses stockbased awards salary and payrollrelated costs for additional accounting staff director compensation exchange listing fees transfer agent and stockholderrelated fees and increased premiums for director and officer liability insurance coverage 

other operating—net other operating—net includes the costs associated with our closed bartow phosphate facility and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations bartow facility 

cf industries holdings inc 

costs include provisions for phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond closure costs water treatment costs and costs associated with the cessation of operations the term other costs refers to amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business litigation expenses gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets and impairment charges for goodwill 

interest expense our interest expense includes the interest on our longterm debt and notes payable annual fees on our senior secured revolving credit facility and amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements 

interest income our interest income represents amounts earned on our cash cash equivalents investments and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 

minority interest amounts reported as minority interest represent the 34 minority interest in the net operating results of cfl our consolidated canadian joint venture we own 49 of the voting common stock of cfl and 66 of cfls nonvoting preferred stock two of our preipo owners own 17 of cfls voting common stock including growmark which owns 9 the remaining 34 of the voting common stock and nonvoting preferred stock of cfl is held by viterra we designate four members of cfls ninemember board of directors which also has one member designated by each of our two preipo owners that own an interest in cfl and three members designated by viterra 

we operate the medicine hat facility and purchase approximately 66 of the facilitys ammonia and urea production pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either us or cfl upon a twelvemonth notice viterra has the right but not the obligation to purchase the remaining 34 of the facilitys ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement to the extent that viterra does not purchase its 34 of the facilitys production we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts since 1995 however viterra has purchased at least 34 of the facilitys production each year 

under the product purchase agreements both we and viterra pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases however the product purchase agreements also provide that cfl will distribute its net earnings to us and viterra annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from cfl the distributions to viterra are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows as we consider these payments to be similar to dividends our product purchase agreement also requires us to advance funds to cfl in the event that cfl is unable to meet its debts as they become due the amount of each advance would be related to the amount of product we purchase or at least 66 of the deficiency and would be more in any year in which we purchased more than 66 of medicine hats production a similar obligation also exists for viterra we and viterra currently manage cfl such that each party is responsible for its share of cfls fixed costs and that cfls production volume meets the parties combined requirements the management agreement the product purchase agreements and any other agreements related to cfl are subject to change with the consent of both parties 

income taxes our income tax provision includes all currently payable and deferred united states and canadian income tax expense applicable to our ongoing operations 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a

deferred tax asset will not be realized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and nonoperating—net respectively 

in connection with our initial public offering ipo in august 2005 cf industries inc cfi ceased to be nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes and we entered into a net operating loss agreement nol agreement with cfis preipo owners relating to the future utilization of the preipo net operating loss carryforwards nols under the nol agreement if it is finally determined that the nols can be utilized to offset applicable postipo taxable income we will pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved 

cfl operates as a cooperative for canadian income tax purposes and distributes all of its earnings as patronage dividends to its customers including cf industries inc for canadian income tax purposes cfl is permitted to deduct an amount equal to the patronage dividends it distributes to its customers provided that certain requirements are met as a result cfl records no income tax provision

results of consolidated operations 

the following tables present our consolidated results of operations 



year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

consolidated operating results 

in 2008 the nitrogen segment benefited from record high crop prices and tight global supply conditions through most of the year later in the year the nitrogen segment was adversely impacted by poor weather conditions during the fall application period and rapidly declining demand due to a combination of declining grain prices and the impact of the world financial crisis operating results in our phosphate segment also improved over 2007 due to record high selling prices and tight international supplydemand conditions our phosphate segment was also adversely affected later in 2008 by a deteriorating international market as well as reduced domestic demand our total gross margin increased by 5527 million to 12227 million for 2008 from a gross margin of 6700 million for 2007 the increase resulted mainly from higher average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices partially offset by higher raw material costs increased purchased product costs unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives and later in the year inventory valuation charges in the phosphate segment net earnings of 6846 million for 2008 included a net pretax unrealized marktomarket loss of 638 million 411 million after tax on natural gas derivatives as well as a 570 million 367 million after tax noncash inventory valuation charge in our phosphate segment net earnings of 3727 million for 2007 included a pretax unrealized marktomarket gain of 170 million 110 million after tax on natural gas derivatives 

cf industries holdings inc 

net sales 

our net sales were 39 billion for 2008 or 11 billion higher than net sales for 2007 higher average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices were partially offset by lower sales volume average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices for 2008 were 44 and 108 higher respectively than the prices for similar products in 2007 reflecting overall tight market conditions and increased international demand our total sales volume decreased 11 to 79 million tons for 2008 versus 89 million tons for 2007 nitrogen sales volume in 2008 decreased 797000 tons or 12 to 61 million tons for 2008 compared to 69 million tons in 2007 due mainly to poor weather conditions during the spring and fall application periods and the decision to reduce sales of lowmargin purchased uan our total level of phosphate sales volume was 18 million tons for 2008 compared to 20 million tons sold in 2007 the decrease in 2008 was caused by reduced domestic demand due to customers deferring phosphate purchases because of ample downstream inventories and uncertain farm economics 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales in our nitrogen segment averaged 296 per ton for 2008 compared to 230 per ton in 2007 an increase of 29 this increase was due largely to higher purchased product costs higher realized natural gas costs and the effect of unrealized marktomarket adjustments on natural gas derivatives the phosphate segment cost of sales averaged 491 per ton for 2008 compared to 247 per ton in the prior year an increase of 99 this increase was due mainly to higher sulfur and ammonia costs and an inventory valuation charge 

during 2008 we sold approximately 56 million tons of fertilizer under our fpp representing approximately 71 of our total sales volume for the period in 2007 we sold approximately 54 million tons of fertilizer under this program representing approximately 60 of our total sales volume for the period 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 4 to 680 million in 2008 compared to 652 million in 2007 this increase was related primarily to an increase in consulting fees legal fees corporate office expenses related to maintaining our previous corporate headquarters and expenses related to performancebased incentive compensation these increases were partially offset by lower longterm stockbased compensation other compensationrelated costs and higher acquisition expenses in the prior period related to our 2007 investment in keytrade 

other operating—net 

other operating—net increased 13 million to 45 million in 2008 from 32 million in 2007 this increase includes a 46 million charge in 2008 primarily for asset retirement obligations aros to recognize revised cost estimates to close the cooling pond and phosphogypsum stack system at our closed bartow florida facility both 2008 and 2007 include gains that were recognized upon the sale of certain closed facilities or property and equipment during 2008 we recorded a gain on the sale of both the excess land at our previous headquarters in long grove illinois and certain property and equipment at our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex in 2007 we recognized a gain when we sold a warehouse and a parcel of land at bartow for a detailed explanation of the accounting for aros at bartow please refer to note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

interest—net 

interest—net increased 18 million to 245 million of net interest income in 2008 from 227 million of net interest income in 2007 interest income increased 17 million to 261 million in 2008 from 244 million in 2007 due to higher average balances of invested cash and higher average rates of return on securities held interest expense decreased 01 million to 16 million in 2008 from 17 million in 2007 

minority interest 

amounts reported as minority interest represent the interest of the 34 minority holder of cfls common and preferred shares the increase in 2008 was due to strong cfl operating results the improvement in cfl operating results reflects higher sales prices for nitrogen fertilizers produced in canada 

income taxes 

our income tax provision for 2008 was 3781 million and represents an effective tax rate of 357 this compared with a tax provision of 1995 million on pretax earnings for 2007 and an effective tax rate of 349 the 2008 increase in the effective tax rate results principally from lower taxexempt interest income earned on our investments in 2008

diluted net earnings per share increased to 1215 per share for 2008 from 657 per share for 2007 due primarily to the increase in net earnings diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding of 564 million for 2008 approximated the prior year level 

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

consolidated operating results 

increased domestic demand coupled with tight domestic and international markets drove strong financial performance in the nitrogen segment in 2007 as compared to the prior year demand increased due to an increase in corn acreage planted higher spring season application rates a strong fall application season driven by favorable weather conditions and expectations of a strong spring season in 2008 operating results in our phosphate segment improved due to tight domestic supplydemand conditions and strong worldwide demand our total gross margin increased by 5228 million to 6700 million for 2007 from a gross margin of 1472 million for 2006 the increase was due largely to higher average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices unrealized marktomarket adjustments on natural gas derivatives and higher nitrogen sales volume partially offset by higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs net earnings of 3727 million for 2007 included a net pretax unrealized marktomarket gain of 170 million 110 million after tax on natural gas derivatives and a pretax charge of 10 million 07 million after tax for changes in estimates to our asset retirement obligations aros and demolition costs net earnings of 333 million for 2006 included a pretax charge of 307 million 187 million after tax for unrealized marktomarket losses 

cf industries holdings inc 

on natural gas derivatives and a pretax charge of 216 million 131 million after tax for adjustments to aros and demolition costs primarily related to our closed bartow florida complex 

net sales 

our net sales were 28 billion for 2007 or 7238 million higher than net sales for 2006 due largely to higher average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices and an increase in nitrogen sales volume our total sales volume increased 6 to 89 million tons for 2007 versus 84 million tons for 2006 nitrogen sales volume in 2007 increased 628000 tons or 10 to 69 million tons for 2007 compared to 63 million tons in 2006 due to increased domestic demand and our customers anticipation of a strong spring season in 2008 our total level of phosphate sales was 20 million tons for 2007 slightly below the 21 million tons sold in 2006 average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices for 2007 were 22 and 46 higher respectively than the prices for similar products in 2006 reflecting overall tight market conditions and increased domestic demand 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales of the nitrogen segment averaged 230 per ton for 2007 compared to 226 per ton in 2006 an increase of 2 this increase was due largely to higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs partially offset by unrealized marktomarket adjustments on natural gas derivatives phosphate cost of sales averaged 247 per ton for 2007 compared to 221 per ton in the prior year an increase of 12 this increase was due mainly to higher costs for finished products we purchased to supplement our production and higher phosphate rock costs 

during 2007 we sold approximately 54 million tons of fertilizer under our fpp representing approximately 60 of our total sales volume for the period in 2006 we sold approximately 30 million tons of fertilizer under this program representing approximately 36 of our total sales volume for the period 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 20 to 652 million in 2007 compared to 545 million in 2006 the yearoveryear increase in expense for 2007 resulted largely from increased expenses related to performancebased shortterm management incentive compensation expenses related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to deerfield illinois increased compensation costs associated with our longterm stockbased compensation expenses related to our keytrade investment and certain software implementation costs 

other operating—net 

other operating—net decreased to 32 million in 2007 from 214 million in 2006 we recorded a 38 million gain on the third quarter 2007 sale of a parcel of land and a warehouse at our closed bartow florida facility in conjunction with that sale we reduced the related aros by 10 million to reflect obligations previously recognized for which we are now no longer responsible on an annual basis we review all aspects of the closed bartow complex with respect to aros and other plant site closure related activities as a result of our year end 2007 review as well as other reviews performed during the year we recorded net upward adjustments of 08 million to other bartow aros during 2007 this upward adjustment excluded the 10 million reduction due to the sale of the land and warehouse previously mentioned in 2006 we recorded a charge of 149 million primarily in the fourth quarter to reflect revised estimates for water treatment and phosphogypsum stack system closure costs and plant closure costs these bartowrelated charges pertained to additional water

treatment costs to accommodate closure of the cooling pond additional phosphogypsum stack system closure costs associated with the cooling channel as well as higher costs related to site closure activities storm water management and closure of the waste water treatment system we also recorded a 33 million charge again primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006 for additional planned demolition activities at bartow for a detailed explanation of the accounting for aros at bartow please refer to note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

interest—net 

interest—net increased to 227 million of net interest income in 2007 from 96 million of net interest income in 2006 interest income increased to 244 million in 2007 from 125 million in 2006 due to higher average balances of invested cash partially offset by lower average rates of return the decrease in the average rates of return is due to substantially all of our shortterm investments for 2007 being in securities that are exempt from federal taxation interest expense decreased 41 to 17 million in 2007 from 29 million in 2006 this decrease was due primarily to 10 million of interest expense recorded in the second quarter of 2006 related to a canadian income tax matter 

minority interest 

amounts reported as minority interest represent the interest of the 34 minority holder of cfls common and preferred shares the increase in 2007 was due to cfl operating results the improvement in cfl operating results reflects stronger market conditions for nitrogen fertilizers produced in canada 

income taxes 

our income tax provision for 2007 was 1995 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 349 this compared with a tax provision of 197 million on pretax earnings for 2006 and an effective tax rate of 372 the 2007 decrease in the effective tax rate results principally from the impact of an increase in the us domestic production activities deduction and nontaxable interest income earned on shortterm investments 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates—net of taxes 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates—net of taxes for 2007 consists of our share of the operating results of keytrade for the period we held the investment in 2007 the amounts recorded in 2007 include a deferred us income tax provision of 07 million on our share of the earnings 

diluted net earnings per share and weightedaverage common shares outstanding 

diluted net earnings per share increased to 657 per share for 2007 from 060 per share for 2006 due primarily to the increase in net earnings partially offset by an increase in the diluted weightedaverage shares of outstanding common stock the increase in the diluted weightedaverage shares of outstanding common stock in 2007 versus 2006 is due to the impact of stock option and restricted stock activity in 2007

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

net sales nitrogen segment net sales increased 27 to 26 billion in 2008 compared to 20 billion in 2007 due to higher average selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume the 44 increase in average ammonia selling prices for 2008 was driven primarily by both a tight domestic and international supplydemand balance and the expectation of strong midwest fall application seasons strength in international markets reflecting a reduction in chinese exports and increased demand in latin america contributed to the 40 increase in average urea selling prices the 49 increase in average uan selling prices for 2008 compared to 2007 reflected the impact of reduced import volume below average producer inventory and stronger conditions in the international market through the third quarter of 2008 while spot selling prices across all nitrogen products decreased significantly later in the year we benefited from the substantial volume we had booked under our fpp with prices that were established earlier in the year nitrogen sales volume decreased 12 to 61 million tons in 2008 compared to 69 million tons in 2007 ammonia volume which decreased approximately 355000 tons in 2008 was impacted by poor weather conditions during both the spring and the fall application periods also overall nitrogen consumption including ammonia was affected during the spring by a reduction in planted corn acres relative to the previous year the 3 decrease in urea sales volumes resulted from relatively full downstream inventories late in the year the 349000 ton decrease in uan sales volumes resulted primarily from our decision to reduce sales of lowmargin purchased uan and a slowdown in demand stemming from high downstream inventories in the second half of the year caused by product carryover from weak spring product movement 

cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment increased 29 to 296 per ton for 2008 compared to 230 per ton for 2007 due largely to higher realized natural gas costs and higher purchased product costs in addition to unrealized marktomarket adjustments on natural gas derivatives the costs of finished products purchased for resale were approximately 1040 million higher in 2008 than in 2007 due primarily to the overall increase in nitrogen prices the overall weightedaverage cost of natural gas supplied to our donaldsonville facility and cfls medicine hat facility including realized gains and losses on derivatives increased by 22 in 2008 versus the cost in 2007 cold temperatures in the first quarter of 2008 along with strong crude oil prices throughout most of the first nine months of 2008 helped drive natural gas prices higher relative to the prior year however in the fourth quarter natural gas prices declined to levels consistent with the fourth quarter of 2007 due to declines in crude oil prices driven by the overall global economic slowdown 

we report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur we recognized a net 638 million unrealized marktomarket loss in 2008 compared to a net 170 million unrealized marktomarket gain in 2007 

during 2008 we sold approximately 45 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under our fpp representing approximately 74 of our nitrogen sales volume for the period in 2007 we sold approximately 46 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program representing approximately 66 of our nitrogen sales volume for the period 

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

net sales nitrogen segment net sales increased 34 to 20 billion in 2007 compared to 15 billion in 2006 due to higher average selling prices as well as higher sales volume the 7 increase in average ammonia selling prices for 2007 arising mainly in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by tight supplies heading into the quarter and a strong fall application season higher average urea selling prices reflected continued strong domestic and international demand the 25 increase in

average uan selling prices for 2007 compared to 2006 reflected strong domestic demand and a tight supplydemand balance nitrogen sales volume increased 10 to 69 million tons in 2007 compared to 63 million tons in 2006 the increase was due to the impact of an increase in corn acres planted higher fertilizer application rates in the spring as well as a strong fall ammonia application season and demand in anticipation of a strong spring 2008 planting season the increase in corn acreage was driven by greater demand by ethanol producers low corn inventories and continued strong demand for feed 

cost of sales total cost of sales in our nitrogen segment averaged 230 per ton for 2007 compared to 226 per ton for 2006 an increase of 2 largely due to higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs partially offset by unrealized marktomarket adjustments on natural gas derivatives the costs of finished fertilizer products purchased for resale were approximately 576 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 due to an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by purchased products as well as the overall increase in nitrogen prices both factors occurring mainly during the last six months of 2007 the overall weightedaverage cost of natural gas supplied to our donaldsonville facility and cfls medicine hat facility including realized gains and losses on derivatives increased by 4 in 2007 versus the cost in 2006 the increase in realized gas costs was due mainly to greater net realized losses on our natural gas derivatives 

we report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur we recognized a net 170 million unrealized marktomarket gain in 2007 compared to a net 307 million unrealized marktomarket loss in 2006 

during 2007 we sold approximately 46 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under our fpp representing approximately 66 of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the period in 2006 we sold approximately 27 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program representing approximately 44 of our nitrogen sales volume for the period

phosphate segment 

the following table presents summary operating data for our phosphate segment 



1 the year ended december 31 2008 includes inventory valuation adjustments associated with our phosphate and potash inventories of 303 million and 267 million respectively 2 p 2 o 5 is the basic measure of the nutrient content in phosphate fertilizer products year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

net sales phosphate segment net sales increased 86 to 13300 million for 2008 compared to 7148 million in 2007 due primarily to higher average selling prices average phosphate selling prices during 2008 more than doubled compared to prices in 2007 the increase was driven by strong worldwide demand caused by tightening world crop balances record grain and oilseed prices and a 

cf industries holdings inc 

runup in raw material prices while spot phosphate selling prices weakened during the last quarter of 2008 we benefited from certain sales made through our fpp at prices agreed upon earlier in the year our phosphate sales volume decreased 10 to 18 million tons in 2008 compared to 20 million tons in 2007 although export sales increased by 87000 tons domestic sales volumes dropped 19 most of this decline occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 as downstream retailer and distributor inventories were full and customers deferred phosphate purchases due to uncertain farm economics 

cost of sales phosphate segment cost of sales averaged 491 per ton for 2008 almost double the 247 per ton in the prior year this increase was due mainly to higher sulfur and ammonia costs and a 570 million noncash inventory valuation adjustment both sulfur and ammonia costs demonstrated significant volatility during the year average annual sulfur costs for 2008 were more than five times the costs for 2007 due to continued tightening in the international markets during the first half of the year which carried over from the end of 2007 as the international markets began to loosen in the second half of the year domestic supply was interrupted due to hurricanes in the gulf coast in the third quarter but the sulfur market collapsed in the fourth quarter due to phosphate production curtailments worldwide an 81 increase in ammonia costs reflected a strong international market until late in the year when demand for phosphate production decreased 

in the second half of 2008 we began staging purchased potash fertilizer in our distribution network and expect to commence sales in the spring season of 2009 the potash results are included in the phosphate segment during the fourth quarter we recorded a 570 million noncash charge to write down our phosphate and potash inventories by 303 million and 267 million respectively as the carrying cost of the inventories exceeded the estimated net realizable values 

during 2008 we sold approximately 11 million tons of phosphate fertilizer under our fpp representing approximately 61 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period in 2007 we sold approximately 835000 tons of phosphate fertilizer under this program representing approximately 42 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period 

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

net sales phosphate segment net sales increased 40 to 7148 million for 2007 compared to 5110 million in 2006 due to higher average selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume average phosphate selling prices during 2007 increased by 46 compared to prices in 2006 the increase was driven by strong domestic demand and reduced domestic production volumes relative to historic levels leading to a tight domestic supplydemand balance our total level of phosphate sales of 20 million tons in 2007 decreased 5 compared to 21 million tons in 2006 export sales of dap and map declined by 206000 tons primarily from reduced availability of product due to scheduled first quarter maintenance activity at our plant city florida phosphate complex along with supply being made available for second quarter domestic sales in anticipation of increased domestic demand effective november 30 2007 we terminated our membership in phoschem and we no longer utilize this sales association to export phosphate fertilizers keytrade has become our sole exporter of phosphate fertilizers 

cost of sales phosphate cost of sales averaged 247 per ton for 2007 compared to 221 per ton for 2006 the 12 increase was due mainly to higher purchased product costs and higher phosphate rock costs as well as higher sulfur costs purchased product costs were approximately 134 million higher in 2007 than in the same period of 2006 due primarily to an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by purchased products mainly occurring during the second quarter of 2007 higher perton phosphate rock mining costs were due to fewer tons mined in 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting from unfavorable mining conditions as well as higher earthmoving costs for land management average annual sulfur costs increased by 10 for 2007 compared to 2006 the increase mainly 

cf industries holdings inc 

occurring in the fourth quarter of 2007 reflected the impact of a strengthening domestic sulfur market fueled by strong demand and insufficient supply we expect the domestic and international sulfur markets to remain tight in 2008 due to strong anticipated demand from phosphate fertilizer and metal producers 

during 2007 we sold approximately 835000 tons of phosphate fertilizer under our fpp representing approximately 42 of our phosphate sales volume for the period in 2006 we sold approximately 294000 tons of phosphate fertilizer under this program representing approximately 14 of our phosphate sales volume for the period 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is cash from operations which includes customer advances our primary uses of cash are operating costs working capital needs capital expenditures and dividends our working capital requirements are affected by several factors including demand for our products selling prices for our products raw material costs freight costs and seasonality factors inherent in the business under our shortterm investment policy we invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us government those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities 

cash balances 

as of december 31 2008 we had cash and cash equivalents of 6250 million and a 3478 million current liability attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under our forward pricing program as of december 31 2007 we had cash and cash equivalents of 3665 million shortterm investments of 4945 million and a 3058 million current liability attributable to customer advances 

investments in auction rate securities 

we hold investments in availableforsale highgrade taxexempt auction rate securities auction rate securities are primarily debt instruments with longterm maturities for which interest rates are expected to be reset periodically through an auction process which typically occurs every 7 to 35 days 

as of december 31 2008 our investments in auction rate securities were reported at their fair value of 1778 million after reflecting a 208 million unrealized holding loss against a par value of 1986 million these securities were all supported by student loans that were originated primarily under the federal family education loan program the underlying securities have stated maturities that range from less than one year to 39 years with the majority of them being in the 20 to 30 year range and are guaranteed by entities affiliated with government entities 

at december 31 2007 our investments in auction rate securities totaled 4945 million comprised of securities supported by municipal bonds and securities supported by student loans 

in february 2008 the market for auction rate securities began to show signs of illiquidity shortly thereafter liquidity left the market and auctions began to fail a failed auction occurs when there are insufficient bids for the number of instruments being offered upon a failed auction the then holders of those instruments continue to hold them and each instrument begins to carry an interest rate based upon a certain predefined formula for that particular security subsequent to the market slowdown for these securities 699 million of our auction rate securities had been either redeemed by the issuers or sold at par value in 2008 including all of our auction rate securities that were supported by municipal bonds 

cf industries holdings inc 

because auctions have continued to fail we no longer consider our auction rate securities to be liquid investments we are not able to access these funds until such time as auctions for the securities succeed once again buyers are found outside the auction process andor the securities are redeemed by the issuers in accordance with our policies we review the underlying securities and assess the creditworthiness of these securities as part of our investment process in each case our reviews have continued to find these investments to be investment grade 

due to the illiquidity in the credit markets and the failed auctions that started in february 2008 market valuations are no longer observable and we have classified these investments as level 3 securities those measured using significant unobservable inputs under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 157— fair value measurements  as disclosed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements sfas no 157 requires supplemental disclosures regarding assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis these investments in auction rate securities represent approximately 82 of the group of assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

we completed a valuation of these investments at december 31 2008 the valuation of these securities utilizes a marktomodel approach that relies on discounted cash flows market data and inputs derived from similar instruments these models take into account among other variables base interest rates credit spreads downgrade risks defaultrecovery risk the estimated time required to work out the disruption in the traditional auction process and its effect on liquidity and the effects of insurance and other credit enhancements based on this valuation we reflected a 208 million pretax unrealized holding loss against the historical cost basis of these investments at december 31 2008 the unrealized holding loss has been reported in other comprehensive income and the impact of the unrealized holding loss is included in the net 1778 million investment balance in auction rate securities at december 31 2008 these investments have been classified as noncurrent on our consolidated balance sheet based on market conditions and our judgment regarding the period of time that may elapse until the traditional auction process resumes or other effective market trading mechanisms develop 

the model we used to value our auction rate securities uses discounted cash flow calculations as one of the significant inputs to the ultimate determination of value the base interest rates assumed for the required rates of return are key components of the calculation of discounted cash flows if the required rate of return we used in the calculation model was 100 basis points lower the resulting holding loss would have been approximately 10 million greater we may need to recognize either additional holding gains or losses in other comprehensive income or holding losses in net earnings should changes occur in either the conditions in the credit markets or in the variables considered in our valuation model 

we believe that ultimately we will recover the historical cost for these instruments as we presently intend to hold these securities until market liquidity returns either through resumption of the auction process or otherwise we do not believe the current market liquidity issues regarding these securities present any operating liquidity issues for us our cash cash equivalents operating cash flow and credit available under our credit facility are adequate to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 

debt 

notes payable representing amounts owed by cfl to its minority interest holder with respect to advances were 41 million as of december 31 2008 and 49 million as of december 31 2007 there were no outstanding borrowings under our 250 million credit facility as of december 31 2008 or december 31 2007 

cf industries holdings inc 

our 250 million credit facility as amended on september 7 2005 and july 31 2007 is scheduled to be available until july 31 2012 and bears interest at a variable rate this facility is secured by working capital certain equipment and the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex our investment in and advances to keytrade have been pledged as security under our credit facility the credit facility provides up to 250 million subject to a borrowing base for working capital and general corporate purposes including up to 50 million for the issuance of letters of credit the borrowing base may be reduced by reserves such as unrealized losses with derivative counterparties who are members of the bank group participating in the facility as of december 31 2008 and 2007 we had 2205 million and 2198 million respectively available under our credit facility see note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information concerning this credit facility 

investment in keytrade 

keytrade is a reseller of fertilizer products that it purchases from various manufacturers around the world and resells in approximately 50 countries through a network of seven offices in october 2007 we purchased 50 of the common shares of keytrade for 259 million and advanced an additional 137 million in the form of subordinated financing and preferred stock the subordinated financing is in the form of notes that mature september 30 2017 and bear interest at libor plus 100 in the fourth quarter of 2008 these notes were redenominated into us dollars from their previous basis of swiss francs under the terms of a commercial agreement we executed with keytrade concurrent with our investment we utilize keytrade as our exclusive exporter of phosphate fertilizer products from north america and as our exclusive importer of uan products into north america we terminated our previous membership in phoschem and no longer utilize them to export phosphate fertilizers we account for keytrade as an equity method investment see note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information concerning the keytrade investment 

capital spending 

capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements of the 367 million increase in capital expenditures in 2008 as compared to 2007 approximately 437 million related to plant and equipment expenditures offset by a reduction of expenditures of 70 million in plant turnaround activity during 2008 we expect to spend approximately 200 million to 300 million on routine capital expenditures in 2009 this amount also includes approximately 28 million for capital expenditures at cfl of which we are obligated to fund 66 

forward pricing program fpp 

we use our fpp to reduce margin risk created by the volatility of fertilizer prices and natural gas costs through the program we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we generally lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by using natural gas derivative instruments and fixed price purchase contracts to hedge against price changes for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers as a result of using derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products for which we effectively fix the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which 

cf industries holdings inc 

are among the largest components of our phosphate costs as a result we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis 

a significant portion of the sales proceeds from fpp orders generally are collected in advance of shipment thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales as of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 we had approximately 3478 million and 3058 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 we had approximately 14 million tons and 30 million tons respectively of nitrogen and phosphate product committed to be sold under the fpp most of this product was scheduled to ship within the next six months 

while customer advances were a significant source of liquidity in both 2008 and 2007 the level of sales under the fpp is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers perceptions of future market fundamentals the lower level of sales on order as of december 31 2008 compared to december 31 2007 may reflect our customers expectations concerning the current fertilizer pricing environment and future expectations regarding pricing and availability of supply under the fpp a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delayed shipments are subject to charges to the customer for storage such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of an fpp contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported results and financial position or liquidity if the level of sales under the fpp were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase also borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future fpp sales activity 

natural gas derivatives 

we use natural gas derivative instruments primarily to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on sales under the forward pricing program our natural gas acquisition policy also allows us to establish derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our forward pricing program 

natural gas derivatives involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts the counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions cash collateral is deposited with or received from counterparties when predetermined unrealized gain or loss thresholds are exceeded 

for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of several counterparties and establishing credit limits monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements 

the master netting arrangements to our derivative instruments also contain credit risk related contingent features that require us to maintain a minimum net worth level and certain financial ratios if we fail to meet these minimum requirements the counterparties to derivative instruments that are in net liability positions could require daily settlement of unrealized losses or some other form of credit support 

as of december 31 2008 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position was 846 million for which we had 108 million of cash collateral on deposit with counterparties this cash collateral is included within margin deposits in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet if we had failed to meet all credit risk contingent thresholds as of december 31 2008 we could have been required to post up to an additional 738 million of collateral with derivative counterparties

financial assurance requirements 

in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment we are subject to financial assurance requirements pursuant to the florida regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure of phosphogypsum stacks we established an escrow account to meet such future obligations we made annual contributions of 62 million 94 million and 111 million in february of 2008 february of 2007 and march of 2006 respectively to this escrow account which by rule is earmarked to cover the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure in the first quarter of 2009 we expect to contribute another 75 million over the subsequent seven years we expect to contribute between 30 million and 70 million annually based upon the required funding formula as defined in the regulations and an assumed rate of return of 2 on invested funds the amount of money that will accumulate in the account by the year 2016 including interest earned on invested funds is currently estimated to be approximately 77 million after 2016 contributions to the account are estimated to average approximately 50 million annually for the following 17 years the balance in the account is estimated to be approximately 210 million by 2033 the amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data these expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the account which are based on the guidelines set forth in the florida regulations ultimately the cash in this account will be used to settle the asset retirement obligations 

florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities we will also be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted the demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a cash deposit arrangement based on these current regulations we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in florida utilizing either of these methods 

other liquidity requirements 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we repurchased 85 million shares of our common stock for approximately 500 million at an average price of 5896 per share under a program authorized by our board of directors as of december 31 2008 these shares were retired reducing additional paidin capital by approximately 124 million and reducing retained earnings by approximately 376 million 

we paid cash dividends of 220 million on outstanding common stock during 2008 this amount represents an annual rate equal to 040 per common share in february of 2008 our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend from 002 to 010 per common share we expect to pay quarterly dividends at such a rate for the foreseeable future under certain conditions our 250 million credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends 

as a result of the credit crisis during the later part of 2008 and continuing into 2009 an investment manager for our us pension plan began implementing restrictions on full withdrawals or transfers of assets from certain mutual funds due to the fact that certain securities within these funds were illiquid investors seeking to liquidate their positions fully would receive a portion of the redemption in cash and the remainder in a prorata distribution of the individual illiquid securities investors are also required to provide more advanced notice of redemptions and the ultimate settlement of the redemption could be extended depending on available liquidity as of december 31 2008 the fair value of our consolidated pension assets was approximately 1816 million of which 

cf industries holdings inc 

approximately 85 million were invested with this particular investment manager and are illiquid these investments have been valued in accordance with sfas no 157— fair value measurements  the liquidity limitations have not impacted the plans ability to make pension benefit payments nor do we expect them to limit its ability to satisfy benefit payment obligations we funded contributions to our us and canadian pension plans totaling 96 million in 2008 we expect to contribute approximately 160 million to our pension plans in 2009

net cash generated from operating activities in 2007 was 6901 million compared to 2036 million in 2006 the 4865 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was due primarily to a 3394 million increase in net earnings and a 1625 million increase in cash generated by working capital changes the 1625 million increase in cash generated by working capital changes is the difference between the 1538 million generated in 2007 and the 87 million consumed in 2006 during 2007 the cash generated by the 2031 million increase in customer advances and the 313 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was partially offset by a 536 million increase in inventories and a 285 million increase in accounts receivable the increase in customer advances was due to an increase in the level of forward sales under our fpp and higher average contracted selling prices the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses is due primarily to an increase in nitrogen fertilizer product purchases the increase in inventories was due to increased prices for purchased product higher manufacturing costs for phosphate products and higher quantities of both nitrogen and phosphate products held at december 31 2007 the increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to the increase in amounts due from our minority interest partner the use of 87 million in cash in 2006 for working capital changes was due primarily to a 624 million increase in accounts receivable and a 289 million decrease in customer advances partially offset by a 

cf industries holdings inc 

516 million decrease in inventories and a 171 million decrease in margin deposits the increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to higher volume shipped under normal commercial terms the decrease in customer advances was due primarily to changes in the product mix of outstanding orders and lower average contract prices the decrease in inventories reflects lower perunit nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing cost and lower quantities of phosphate fertilizers held at december 31 2006 the decrease in margin deposits was due primarily to lower margin requirements

1 represents the undiscounted inflationadjusted estimated cash outflows required to settle the recorded aros the corresponding present value of these future expenditures is 1007 million as of december 31 2008 we also have unrecorded aros at our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex at cfls medicine hat facility and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included is reclamation of land and in the case of donaldsonville reclamation of two effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2008 dollars is approximately 20 million currently we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities therefore the table above does not contain any cash flows for these aros see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our aros as described in financial assurance requirements we intend to set aside cash on an annual basis in an escrow account established to cover costs associated with closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems this account will be the source of a significant portion of the cash required to settle the aros pertaining to the phosphogypsum stack systems 

2 cash flows occurring after 2013 are detailed in the following table the following table details the undiscounted inflationadjusted estimated cash flows after 2013 required to settle the recorded aros as discussed above

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer and a corporate office lease the rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to seven years and the barge charter commitments currently have terms ranging from one to three years we also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements at several of our distribution locations some of which contain minimum throughput requirements the storage agreements contain minimum terms ranging from one to three years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party 

in 2006 we entered into a tenyear operating lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters located in deerfield illinois the corporate office lease agreement includes leasehold incentives rent holidays and scheduled rent increases that are expensed on a straightline basis in accordance with sfas no 13— accounting for leases our other operating lease agreements do not contain significant contingent rents leasehold incentives rent holidays scheduled rent increases concessions or unusual provisions see note 24 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information concerning leases 

we do not have any other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance 

cf industries holdings inc 

with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss is transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statement of operations 

assets held for sale 

in 2006 we decided to sell our corporate office facility in long grove illinois and in 2007 we relocated our corporate headquarters to deerfield illinois as of december 31 2007 the net book value of the long grove building and related land 67 million was classified as assets held for sale the long grove facility consisted of an office building and a parcel of excess land in the first quarter of 2008 due to a decline in the real estate market and a deteriorating credit market negotiations with potential buyers of the building stalled and we no longer considered it probable that it would be sold within one year as a result as of march 31 2008 we reclassified the carrying value of the building 61 million back to property plant and equipment and recognized 04 million in the first quarter of 2008 for the associated depreciation for the period of time it was classified as held for sale and reinitiated depreciation we sold the excess land in july of 2008 and we recognized a pretax gain of approximately 43 million in the third quarter of 2008 see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information concerning these assets 

useful lives of depreciable assets 

property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation is computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction uop method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers estimates engineering or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews 

scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities are referred to as plant turnarounds expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is generally until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years 

at the end of 2006 we completed a comprehensive review of the depreciable lives of our production facilities and related assets as well as estimated production capacities used to develop our uop depreciation expense as a result of this review we increased the depreciable lives of certain assets at our nitrogen production facilities separately we revised the estimates of production capacities for certain uop assets as a result of these changes depreciation expense was reduced by 115 million for 2007

inventory valuation 

we review our inventory balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our initial estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation 

asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation liabilities 

costs associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the bartow and plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complexes and costs associated with land reclamation activities at our hardee florida phosphate rock mine are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 143— accounting for asset retirement obligations  if the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated asset retirement obligations aros are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service costs associated with the cessation of operations at all of our facilities are accounted for in accordance with fin no 47— accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  this interpretation requires us to recognize an aro for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain the obligations related to closure reclamation and cessation of operations are capitalized at their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded the liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time the asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over their estimated useful life the aggregate carrying value of all of our aros was 1007 million as of december 31 2008 and 894 million as of december 31 2007 the increase in the aggregate carrying value of these aros is due to recording changes in estimates and normal accretion expense offset by cash expenditures on existing aros as previously discussed 

environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated consistent with the requirements of sfas no 5— accounting for contingencies  estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts existing technology sitespecific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations in reporting environmental liabilities no offset is made for potential recoveries all liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur in accordance with gaap environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits changes in laws regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements the amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled 67 million as of december 31 2008 and 81 million as of december 31 2007 

the actual amounts to be spent on aros and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments and cost inflation as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

recoverability of longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment as well as other longlived assets on a regular basis in accordance with sfas no 144— accounting for the impairment or disposal 

cf industries holdings inc 

of longlived assets  we also review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries on a regular basis in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 18— the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  if impairment of an asset or investment has occurred an impairment charge is recognized immediately factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume prices inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the recoverability of the values associated with our longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business 

fair value measurements 

we adopted sfas no 157— fair value measurements as of january 1 2008 as of december 31 2008 we also considered the guidance in financial accounting standards board staff position fsp no 1573— determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active in determining the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities we have classified our investments in auction rate securities as level 3 securities those measured using significant unobservable inputs under the provisions of sfas no 157 see the liquidity and capital resources section of this discussion and analysis for detailed information concerning the critical accounting estimates involved in valuing and classifying these investments no other assets or liabilities are classified as level 3 items in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional information concerning fair value measurements 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and nonoperating—net respectively 

in connection with our initial public offering ipo in august 2005 cf industries inc cfi ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes and we entered into a net operating loss agreement nol agreement with cfis preipo owners relating to the future utilization of the preipo net operating loss carryforwards nols under the nol agreement if it is finally determined that the nols can be utilized to offset applicable postipo taxable income we will pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved 

in the third quarter of 2008 we took tax positions utilizing a portion of the nols resulting in an increase in our unrecognized tax benefits see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion concerning nols and the nol agreement 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our 

cf industries holdings inc 

projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 2472 million at december 31 2008 which was 656 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2008 pbo was computed based on a 650 discount rate which was based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 169 million higher than the amount previously discussed conversely if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 152 million lower the discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2008 was 600 if the discount rate used to compute 2008 pension expense was lower by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 17 million higher than the amount calculated conversely if the discount rate used to compute 2008 pension expense was higher by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 08 million lower than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 73 expected longterm rate of return on assets is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher by 50 basis points pension expense for 2008 would have been 11 million lower conversely if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2008 would have been 11 million higher see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our pension plans 

retiree medical benefits 

retiree medical benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions including discount rates used to compute the present value of the future obligations and expected increases in health care costs changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs affect the recorded amount of retiree medical benefits expense 

stockbased compensation 

costs associated with stockbased compensation are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 123r— sharebased payment sfas 123r which requires us to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards over the service period the fair value of nonqualified stock options granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes option valuation model key assumptions used in the blackscholes option valuation model include expected volatility and expected term the weightedaverage expected volatility used to value the stock options granted in 2008 was 58 if the expected volatility was 2 higher or lower the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 26 higher or lower respectively the expected term of the stock options granted in 2008 was five years if the expected term was six months higher or lower the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 43 higher or lower respectively the basis for determining these assumptions may change as more experience is obtained with our own historical stock prices and employees option exercise behavior 

we accrue the cost of stockbased awards on the straightline method over the applicable vesting period as a result total compensation cost recognized for 2008 on a pretax basis was 83 million as of december 31 2008 on a pretax basis there was approximately 81 million and 35 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonqualified options and restricted stock which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 23 and 21 years respectively see note 28 to our

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest as well as variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary our judgment in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our level of involvement in setting up the entity determining whether the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on our behalf determining whether we provide more than half the subordinated financial support to the entity and determining whether we absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses or returns 

we use the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions 

we eliminate from our consolidated financial results all significant intercompany transactions

our fpp seeks to reduce the risk inherent in the relationship between volatile fertilizer prices and natural gas costs for product that we manufacture our basic concept when applied to nitrogen fertilizers is to fix the price of our principal raw material natural gas coincident with the establishment of the fertilizer sales price which often occurs months in advance of shipment customer advances which typically represent a significant portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with the fpp are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as is the case for all of our sale transactions revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost using natural gas derivative instruments or in some cases with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products for which we effectively fix the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which are 

cf industries holdings inc 

among the largest components of our phosphate costs as a result we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis 

during 2008 2007 and 2006 we sold approximately 56 million 54 million and 30 million tons of fertilizer representing approximately 71 60 and 36 of our sales volume respectively under the fpp as of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 we had approximately 14 million tons of product and 30 million tons of product respectively committed to be sold under this program most of these amounts were scheduled to ship within six months of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively 

as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products and a substantial portion of the cost to manufacture the nitrogen products under our fpp often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

participation in the fpp is affected by market conditions and our customers expectations there can be no assurance that we will transact the same percentage of our business under the fpp in the future under the fpp a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delayed shipments are subject to charges to the customer for storage such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of an fpp contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported results and financial position should the level of participation decrease there is a risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings of future periods 

discussion of seasonality impacts on operations 

our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in the valuation of our investments interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

investments in auction rate securities 

as of december 31 2008 we had 1778 million of investments in auction rate securities consisting of availableforsale tax exempt auction rate securities that were all supported by student loans that were originated primarily under the federal family education loan program due to the illiquidity in the credit markets auctions for these securities have failed as a result these investments are no longer liquid investments and we will not be able to access these funds until such time as auctions for these securities are successful buyers are found outside of the auction process andor the securities are redeemed by the issuer further details regarding these securities are included in notes 5 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources both in this form 10k 

the valuation of these securities utilizes a marktomodel approach that relies on discounted cash flows market data and inputs that are derived from similar instruments based on this valuation we reflected a 208 million pretax unrealized holding loss against the historical cost basis of these investments as of december 31 2008 the unrealized holding loss has been reported in other comprehensive income and the impact of the unrealized holding loss is recorded in the net 1778 million investment balance in auction rate securities if the required rate of return we used in the calculation model was 100 basis points higher the resulting holding loss would have been approximately 10 million higher we may need to recognize either additional holding gains or losses in other comprehensive income or holding losses in net earnings should changes occur in either the conditions in the credit markets or in the variables considered in our valuation model 

upon a failed auction the instrument carries an interest rate based upon certain predefined formulas a 100 basis point change in the average rate of interest earned on these investments would result in a 20 million change in pretax income on an annual basis 

interest rate fluctuations 

as of december 31 2008 we had notes payable of approximately 41 million that had a floating interest rate a 100 basis point change in interest rates on our notes payable would result in a 40000 change in pretax income on an annual basis the senior secured revolving credit facility bears a current market rate of interest such that we are subject to interest rate risk on borrowings under this facility as of december 31 2008 there were no borrowings under this facility 

our advances to unconsolidated affiliates consisted of floating rate subordinated debt owed to us by keytrade totaling 124 million as of december 31 2008 a 100 basis point change in interest rates on this subordinated debt would result in 124000 change in pretax earnings on an annual basis 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we are exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar as a result of our 66 economic interest and our 49 common equity interest in cfl we have made advances to cfl of 96 million canadian dollars at the present time we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to cfl 

cf industries holdings inc 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to the nitrogen and phosphate sales not made under our forward pricing program are sensitive to changes in nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia urea and uan 28 by approximately 33 22 and 12 respectively 

we use natural gas in the manufacture of our nitrogen products because natural gas prices are volatile our natural gas acquisition policy includes the objective of providing protection against significant adverse natural gas price movements we manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering periods not exceeding three years 

the derivative instruments that we currently use are natural gas swap contracts these contracts settle using nymex futures for donaldsonville or aeco for medicine hat price indexes which represent fair value at any given time the contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods 

we account for derivatives under sfas no 133— accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by subsequent standards under these standards derivatives are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and changes in their fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the normal purchase and sale exemption applies we use natural gas derivatives primarily as an economic hedge of gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting under sfas no 133 accordingly changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities 

as of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 we had open derivative contracts for 167 million mmbtus and 391 million mmbtus respectively of natural gas most of which related to sales that had been contracted to be sold through our forward pricing program for the year ended december 31 2008 we used derivatives to cover approximately 96 of our natural gas consumption at donaldsonville and approximately 86 of our twothirds share of gas consumption at medicine hat an overall 100 per mmbtu change in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change the pretax unrealized marktomarket gainloss on these derivative positions by 167 million 

we purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of dap and map we attempt to include any price fluctuations related to these raw materials in our selling prices of finished products but there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered we enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices a 10 per ton change in the related cost of a ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change dap production cost by 210 per ton and 380 per ton respectively we also purchase ammonia urea and uan to augment or replace production at our facilities

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

through the end of 2002 we operated as a traditional supply cooperative our focus was on providing our preipo owners with an assured supply of fertilizer typically over 80 of our annual sales volume was to our preipo owners though important financial performance was subordinate to our mandated supply objective 

in 2002 we reassessed our corporate mission and adopted a new business model that established financial performance rather than assured supply to our preipo owners as our principal objective a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace we began to pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on financial performance one result of this approach was a substantial shift in our customer mix by 2007 our sales to customers other than our preipo owners and western cooperative fertilizers limited westco our joint venture partner in cfl reached approximately 48 of our total sales volume for the year which was more than double the comparable percentage for 2002 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering of common stock and listing on the new york stock exchange we sold 47437500 shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 7154 million we did not retain any of the proceeds from the ipo in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative in the reorganization transaction our preipo owners equity interests in cf industries inc now our whollyowned subsidiary were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and 7562499 shares of our common stock 

operating segments 

our business is divided into two operating segments the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business 

nitrogen fertilizer business 

we are one of the leading nitrogen fertilizer producers in north america our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia urea and uan our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the following table the sales shown do not reflect amounts used internally in the 

cf industries holdings inc 

manufacture of other products for example in 2007 we used about 23 million tons of ammonia in the production of urea and uan 

 1 other nitrogen fertilizer products include aqua ammonia 2 we have corrected our previously presented 2006 and 2005 nitrogen segment financial results to include shipping and handling amounts that were billed to our customers in net sales previously we reported these shipping and handling amounts as a reduction of cost of sales this correction increased both net sales and cost of sales in 2006 and 2005 by 547 million and 371 million respectively the correction did not change our previously presented gross margin but did change our previously presented gross margin percentage and average selling prices see note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion gross margin for the nitrogen fertilizer business was 4468 million 985 million and 1729 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

total assets for the nitrogen fertilizer business were 5939 million and 4939 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

we operate worldscale nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in donaldsonville louisiana and medicine hat alberta canada we own the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex and have a 66 economic interest in cfl a canadian joint venture that owns the medicine hat nitrogen fertilizer complex the combined production capacity of these two facilities represented approximately 20 of north american ammonia capacity 34 of north american dry urea capacity and 19 of north american uan capacity in 2007 

the following table summarizes our nitrogen fertilizer production volume for the last three years at our facilities in donaldsonville louisiana and medicine hat alberta 

 1 gross ammonia production including amounts subsequently upgraded onsite into urea andor uan 2 includes total production of the donaldsonville and medicine hat facilities including the 34 interest of westco our joint venture partner in canadian fertilizers limited 3 

cf industries holdings inc 

donaldsonville nitrogen complex 

the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex is the largest nitrogen fertilizer production facility in north america it has four worldscale ammonia plants four urea plants and two uan plants it has the annual capacity to produce approximately 23 million tons of ammonia most of which is typically upgraded into urea and uan 26 million tons of liquid urea including amounts upgraded into uan and 27 million tons of uan measured on a 28 nitrogen content basis with uan operating at capacity approximately 17 million tons of granular urea can be produced granular urea production can be increased to 2 million tons per year if uan production is reduced 

we believe that this facility is the most versatile nitrogen fertilizer production complex in north america with multiple production units for each product the complex has considerable flexibility to adjust its product mix donaldsonville is located near the mouth of the mississippi river and has three docks that can be used simultaneously under most river conditions in addition donaldsonville is located on the union pacific railroad and a 2000mile ammonia pipeline providing us with flexible and competitively priced transportation to our inmarket nitrogen fertilizer terminals and warehouses by rail and pipeline as well as by barge the facility is capable of docking and unloading into its storage system oceangoing ship loads of ammonia and uan providing us with direct access to global suppliers the complex has onsite storage for 70000 tons of ammonia 135000 tons of uan measured on a 28 nitrogen content basis and 83000 tons of granular urea providing us with flexibility to handle temporary disruptions to shipping activities without impacting production and also flexibility to purchase and store liquid product for resale 

medicine hat nitrogen complex 

medicine hat is the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in canada it has two worldscale ammonia plants that have a combined gross annual production capacity of approximately 13 million tons and a worldscale urea plant that has a gross annual production capacity of 810000 tons the complex has onsite storage for 60000 tons of ammonia and 70000 tons of urea providing flexibility to handle temporary disruptions of outbound shipments 

the medicine hat facility is owned by cfl we own 49 of the voting common stock of cfl and 66 of cfls nonvoting preferred stock westco owns 34 of the voting common stock and nonvoting preferred stock of cfl the remaining 17 of the voting common stock of cfl is owned by growmark inc growmark and la coop fédérée we designate four members of cfls ninemember board of directors westco designates 3 members and growmark and la coop fédérée each designate one member cfl is included in our consolidated financial statements 

we operate the medicine hat facility and purchase approximately 66 of the facilitys ammonia and urea production pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either cf industries inc or cfl upon a twelvemonth notice westco has the right but not the obligation to purchase the remaining 34 of the facilitys ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement to the extent that westco does not purchase its 34 of the facilitys production we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts since 1995 however westco has purchased at least 34 of the facilitys production each year 

under the product purchase agreements both we and westco pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases however the product purchase agreements also provide that cfl will distribute its net earnings to westco and us annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from cfl our product purchase agreement also requires us to advance funds to cfl in the event that cfl is unable to meet its debts as they become due the amount of each advance would be 

cf industries holdings inc 

at least 66 of the deficiency and would be more in any year in which we purchased more than 66 of medicine hats production a similar obligation also exists for westco we and westco currently manage cfl such that each party is responsible for its share of cfls fixed costs and that cfls production volume meets the parties combined requirements the management agreement the product purchase agreements and any other agreements related to cfl are subject to change with the consent of both parties 

nitrogen fertilizer raw materials 

natural gas is the principal raw material as well as the primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at both the donaldsonville and the medicine hat facilities in 2007 our natural gas purchases accounted for approximately 50 of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization donaldsonville is located in close proximity to one of the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america known as the henry hub medicine hat is located in close proximity to one of the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in canada known as aeco 

we use a combination of spot and term purchases of varied duration from a variety of suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced natural gas supply in addition we use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices 

in 2007 the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex consumed approximately 80 million mmbtus of natural gas the facility has access to five natural gas pipelines and obtains gas from several suppliers in 2007 the largest individual supplier provided approximately 43 of the donaldsonville facilitys total gas requirement the medicine hat complex consumed approximately 40 million mmbtus of natural gas in 2007 the facility has access to two natural gas pipelines and obtains gas from numerous suppliers the largest of which supplied approximately 24 of the gas consumed in 2007 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex which is located on the mississippi river includes a deepwater docking facility access to an ammonia shipping pipeline and truck and railroad loading capabilities we ship our share of ammonia and urea produced at the medicine hat nitrogen fertilizer complex by truck and rail to customers in the united states and canada and to our storage facilities in the northern united states 

ammonia urea and uan from donaldsonville can be loaded into river barges and oceangoing vessels for direct shipment to domestic customers for transport to storage facilities or for export we own six ammonia river barges with a total capacity of approximately 16400 tons we contract on a dedicated basis for tug services and the operation of these barges we have 20 uan river barges contracted on a dedicated basis with a total capacity of approximately 60000 tons additional ammonia and uan barge capacity is contracted for as needed river transportation for urea is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators 

the donaldsonville facility is connected to a 2000mile long ammonia pipeline used by several nitrogen producers to transport ammonia to over 20 terminals and shipping points located in the midwestern us cornbelt we are a major customer of this ammonia pipeline in 2007 approximately 61 of our ammonia shipments from our donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex were transported via the ammonia pipeline 

cf industries holdings inc 

we also transport substantial volumes of urea and uan from the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex and ammonia and urea from the medicine hat nitrogen fertilizer complex by rail in addition to using rail cars provided by the rail carriers as of december 31 2007 we had leases in place for approximately 600 ammonia tank cars 1000 uan tank cars and 600 dry product hopper cars 

phosphate fertilizer business 

we are a major manufacturer of phosphate fertilizer products our main phosphate fertilizer products are dap and map our historical sales of phosphate fertilizer products are shown in the table below 

 1 we have corrected our previously presented 2006 and 2005 phosphate segment financial results to include shipping and handling amounts that were billed to our customers in net sales previously we reported these shipping and handling amounts as a reduction of cost of sales this correction increased both net sales and cost of sales in 2006 and 2005 by 287 million and 224 million respectively the correction did not change our previously presented gross margin but did change our previously presented gross margin percentage and average selling prices see note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion gross margin for the phosphate fertilizer business was 2232 million 487 million and 363 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

total assets for the phosphate fertilizer business were 4935 million and 4269 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

our phosphate fertilizer manufacturing operations are located in central florida and consist of a phosphate fertilizer chemical complex in plant city and a phosphate rock mine a beneficiation plant and phosphate rock reserves in hardee county we own each of these facilities and properties 

cf industries holdings inc 

the following table summarizes our phosphate fertilizer production volumes for the last three years and current production capacities for phosphaterelated products 

 1 reflects debottlenecking projects which have increased our total capacity 2 p 2 o 5 is the basic measure of the nutrient content in phosphate fertilizer products phosphoric acid capacity is based on captive sulfuric acid capacity hardee county phosphate rock mine 

in 1975 we purchased 20000 acres of land in hardee county florida that was originally estimated to contain in excess of 100 million tons of recoverable rock reserves between 1978 and mid1993 we operated a one million ton per year phosphate rock mine on a 5000acre portion of these reserves 

in 1992 we initiated a project to expand and relocate mining operations to the remaining 15000acre area of the reserve property the new phosphate rock mine cost 135 million and began operations in late 1995 in 1997 we added approximately 20 million tons to our reserve base through an exchange with a neighboring rock producer in 1999 we acquired 1400 acres containing an estimated 8 million tons of rock reserves 

the table below shows the estimated reserves as of december 31 2007 at the hardee phosphate complex also reflected in the table is the grade of the reserves expressed as a percentage of bone phosphate of lime bpl and p 2 o 5  finally the table also reflects the average values of the following material contaminants contained in the reserves ferrous oxide fe 2 o 3  plus aluminum oxide a1 2 o 3  and magnesium oxide mgo 

proven and probable reserves 1 hardee phosphate complex as of december 31 2007 

 1 the minimum drill hole density for the proven reserves classification is 1 hole per 20 acres 2 the reserve estimates provided have been developed by the company in accordance with industry guide 7 promulgated by the sec we estimate that 99 of the reserves are proven 7 

cf industries holdings inc 

our phosphate reserve estimates are based on geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff geologist as of december 31 2007 reserve estimates are updated periodically to reflect actual phosphate rock production new drilling information and other geological or mining data with drilling that was done in 2007 estimates for 99 of the reserves are now based on 20acre density drilling 

plant city phosphate complex 

our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in north america at one million tons per year its phosphoric acid capacity represents approximately 10 of the total us capacity all of plant citys phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates dap and map representing approximately 12 of us capacity for ammonium phosphate fertilizer products in 2007 the combination of the plant city phosphate fertilizer complex and the hardee mine gives us one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in north america 

bartow phosphate complex 

we own a former phosphate manufacturing complex in bartow florida that ceased production in 1999 the site contains the former manufacturing facilities storage and distribution facilities and the phosphogypsum stack system in 2007 we sold the storage and distribution facilities along with approximately 35 acres of land and are currently dismantling the manufacturing facilities in accordance with local laws and regulations we continue to be obligated for the closure of the phosphogypsum stack system management of water treatment on the site and providing longterm care for the site during this closing period 

phosphate raw materials 

phosphate rock supply phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers approximately 35 tons of phosphate rock are needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5 the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex consumes in excess of three million tons of rock annually as of december 31 2007 our hardee rock mine had approximately 15 years of fullypermitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our hardee property where we can mine the expanded area has an estimated 31 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves we estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately nine additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area 

sulfur supply sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid approximately threequarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5 our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 800000 long tons of sulfur annually when operating at capacity we obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration in 2007 martin sulphur our largest molten sulfur supplier supplied approximately 60 of the molten sulfur used at plant city martin sulphur formerly cf martin sulphur was created in november 2000 as a joint venture between martin resource management and certain of its affiliates martin and us on july 15 2005 we sold our interest in the venture to martin concurrent with the sale we entered into a multiyear sulfur supply contract with martin sulphur 

ammonia supply dap has a nitrogen content of 18 map has a nitrogen content of 11 and both dap and map have a phosphate nutrient content of 46 ammonia is the primary source of 

cf industries holdings inc 

nitrogen in dap and map operating at capacity our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex consumes approximately 400000 tons of ammonia annually 

the ammonia used at our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia storage facility located in tampa florida this facility acquired in 1992 consists of a 38000ton ammonia storage tank access to a deepwater dock that is capable of discharging oceangoing vessels and rail and truckloading facilities in addition to supplying our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex our tampa ammonia distribution system has the capacity to support ammonia sales to andor distribution services for other customers sales of ammonia from our tampa terminal are reported in our nitrogen business segment the ammonia supply for tampa is purchased from offshore sources providing us with access to the broad international ammonia market 

phosphate distribution 

we operate a phosphate warehouse located at a deepwater port facility in tampa florida most of the phosphate fertilizer produced at plant city is shipped by truck or rail to our tampa warehouse where it is loaded onto vessels for shipment to export customers or for transport across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river in 2007 our tampa warehouse handled approximately 11 million tons of phosphate fertilizers or about 55 of our production the remainder of our phosphate fertilizer production is transported by truck or rail directly to customers or to inmarket storage facilities 

phosphate fertilizer shipped across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river is transferred into river barges near new orleans phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is transported to our storage facilities or delivered directly to customers river transportation is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators 

storage facilities and other properties 

we currently own or rent space at 41 inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 16state region including storage at our production facilities and at the tampa warehouse and ammonia terminal we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately two million tons of fertilizer our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table 

 1 capacity is expressed as the equivalent volume of uan measured on a 28 nitrogen content basis 2 our dry products include urea dap and map 3 our lease agreements are typically for periods of one to three years 9 

cf industries holdings inc 

in addition to these facilities we also own our former corporate headquarters facility located in long grove illinois in the first quarter of 2007 we relocated our corporate headquarters to a leased office facility located in deerfield illinois we are currently seeking a buyer for our facility in long grove illinois 

customers 

the principal customers for our nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors sales are generated by cfs internal marketing and sales force 

the following table sets forth the sales to our major customers for the past three years 

 1 includes sales to agriliance llc a 5050 joint venture between chs inc chs and land olakes inc prior to the september 1 2007 transaction in which agriliance distributed its crop nutrients business to chs 2 conagra international fertilizer company a wholly owned subsidiary of conagra foods inc conagra chs growmark and conagra are significant customers of both the nitrogen and phosphate segments a loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and the individual results of each segment 

growmark is a significant holder of our common stock as of december 31 2007 growmark was the beneficial owner of approximately 4 of our outstanding common stock in addition william davisson the chief executive officer of growmark and john d johnson the president and chief executive officer of chs are members of our board of directors for additional information on related party transactions see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements note 31—related party transactions 

in october 2006 we became a member of phosphate chemicals export association inc phoschem phoschem was founded in 1974 in accordance with the provisions of the us webbpomerene act and is the export marketing association for its members phoschem is the largest exporter of concentrated phosphate from north america in 2007 phoschem was our primary means of exporting phosphate products representing approximately 5 of our 2007 phosphate net sales in december 2007 we began an exclusive marketing arrangement with keytrade under which keytrade became our exclusive sales agent for phosphate products outside of the us concurrent with the start of the keytrade marketing arrangement we ended our membership in phoschem no gain or loss was recognized exiting phoschem for additional information on keytrade see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements note 17—investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates

competition 

our markets are intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

in the nitrogen fertilizer business our primary north americanbased competitors are agrium koch nitrogen and terra industries there is also significant competition from product sourced from regions of the world with low natural gas costs because urea is a widelytraded fertilizer product and there are limited barriers to entry competition from foreignsourced product is particularly acute with respect to urea 

in the phosphate fertilizer business our primary north americanbased competitors are agrium mosaic potash corp and simplot historically imports have not been a factor as the united states is a large net exporter of phosphate fertilizers 

seasonality 

the sales patterns of all five of our major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

financial information about foreign and domestic sales and operations 

the amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying value of our foreign and domestic assets are set forth in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements note 30—segment disclosures 

environment health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes violations can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment 

we have received notices from time to time from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws we are currently involved in remediation activities at certain of our current and former

facilities we are also participating in the cleanup of thirdparty sites at which we have disposed of wastes in april 2002 we were asked by the current owner of a former phosphate mine and manufacturing facility that we operated in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho to contribute to a remediation of this property we declined to participate in the cleanup it is our understanding that the current owner is undertaking an investigation of the environmental conditions at the site we do not know if a final remedy has been identified by the current owner and approved by the state we anticipate that the current owner may bring a lawsuit against us seeking contribution for the cleanup costs although we do not have sufficient information to determine when such a suit may be brought we are not able to estimate at this time our potential liability with respect to the remediation of this property based on currently available information we do not expect that any remedial or financial obligations we may be subject to involving this or other sites will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in december 2004 and january 2005 the united states environmental protection agency epa inspected our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex to evaluate the facilitys compliance with rcra the federal statute that governs the generation transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous wastes by letter dated september 27 2005 epa region iv issued to the company a notice of violation nov and compliance evaluation inspection report the nov and compliance evaluation inspection report alleged a number of violations of rcra including violations relating to recordkeeping the failure to properly make hazardous waste determinations as required by rcra and alleged treatment of sulfuric acid waste without a permit the most significant allegation in the nov is that the plant city facilitys reuse of phosphoric acid process water which is otherwise exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste in the production of ammoniated phosphate fertilizer and the return of this process water to the facilitys process water recirculating system has resulted in the disposal of hazardous waste into the system without a permit the compliance evaluation inspection report indicates that as a result the entire process water system including all pipes cooling ponds and gypsum stacks could be regulated as hazardous waste management units under rcra if the epas position is eventually upheld the company could incur material expenditures in order to modify its practices or it may be required to comply with regulations applicable to hazardous waste treatment storage or disposal facilities if the company is required to comply with such obligations it could incur material capital and operating expenditures or may be required to cease operation of the water recirculating system that does not meet rcra standards this would cause a significant disruption of the operations of the plant city facility the epa has referred the matter to the department of justice for enforcement for additional information see item 3 legal proceedings 

we expect continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future investments for environmental controls at our ongoing operations our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2007 were approximately 32 million we estimate that we will spend approximately 12 million in 2008 for environmental health and safety capital expenditures environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example there is increasing government and public emphasis on the impact of carbon emissions on the environment and various taxes limits or caps have been proposed on carbon emissions like other fertilizer and chemical producers our plants emit carbon dioxide as part of the manufacturing process we may be required to incur additional expenditures to comply with new environmental health and safety laws and regulations and any such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we hold numerous environmental and mining permits authorizing operations at our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or 

cf industries holdings inc 

approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals 

as of december 31 2007 the area permitted for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 54 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current production rates for approximately 15 years we have secured the necessary permits to mine these reserves from the florida department of environmental protection and the us army corps of engineers we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated additional 31 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately nine additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area the estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective of the anticipated permittable mining areas based on recent similar permitting efforts in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

likewise our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2014 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits we have secured the local development authorization to increase the capacity of this stack system based on this authorization estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately eight years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in certain cases as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure the government that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities in march 2006 we established an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection as a means of taking advantage of a safe harbor provision in a 2005 amendment to floridas regulations pertaining to financial assurance requirements for the closure of phosphogypsum stacks for additional information on the cash deposit arrangement see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements note 9—asset retirement obligations 

several of our permits including our mining permit at the hardee phosphate complex require us to reclaim any property disturbed by our operations at our hardee property we currently mine approximately 300 to 400 acres of land each year all of which must be reclaimed the costs to reclaim this land vary based on the type of land involved and range from 3000 to 20000 an acre with an average of 6200 an acre for additional information on our hardee asset retirement obligations see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements note 9—asset retirement obligations 

our phosphate operations in florida are subject to regulations governing the closure and longterm maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at our bartow phosphate complex we

estimate that we will spend a total of approximately 5 million in 2008 and 2009 and another 6 million between 2016 and 2023 to complete closure of the phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond water treating expenditures at bartow are estimated to require about 12 million over the next 49 years postclosure longterm care expenditures at bartow are estimated to total approximately 75 million for a 66 year period including 2008 to close the phosphogypsum stack currently in use at the plant city phosphate complex we estimate that we will spend approximately 68 million during the years 2033 through 2037 and another 48 million in 2087 to close the cooling pond water treating expenditures at plant city are estimated to approximate 6 million in 2018 67 million in 2033 through 2037 and 155 million thereafter through 2087 postclosure longterm care expenditures at plant city are estimated to total 111 million for a 50 year period commencing in 2038 these amounts are in nominal dollars using an assumed inflation rate of 3 for additional information on our asset retirement obligations related to our phosphogypsum stack systems see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements note 9—asset retirement obligations 

cost estimates for closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems are based on formal closure plans submitted to the state of florida which are subject to revision during negotiations over the next several years moreover the time frame involved in the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems extends as far as the year 2087 accordingly the actual amount to be spent also will depend upon factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation and changes in applicable laws and regulations these cost estimates may also increase if the plant city phosphogypsum stack is expanded further for additional information on our plant city asset retirement obligations see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements note 9—asset retirement obligations

 item 1a risk factors 

  our business is subject to a number of risks if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is dependent on the price of natural gas in north america which is both expensive and highly volatile 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea and uan because all of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses expenditures on natural gas comprised approximately 50 of the total cost of our nitrogen fertilizer sales in 2007 and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization 

the market price for natural gas in north america is significantly higher than the price of natural gas in certain other major fertilizerproducing regions for example during 2007 natural gas prices in the united states measured at the henry hub near our donaldsonville louisiana facility averaged approximately 693 per mmbtu and in canada measured at aeco near our joint ventures medicine hat alberta facility averaged approximately 599 per mmbtu in comparison during 2007 natural gas prices paid by fertilizer producers are estimated to have been approximately 150 per mmbtu in russia and approximately 070 per mmbtu in the middle east many of our competitors benefit from access to lowerpriced natural gas through manufacturing facilities or interests in manufacturing facilities located in these regions or other regions with abundant supplies of natural gas 

the price of natural gas in north america is also highly volatile during 2007 the median daily price at henry hub ranged from a low of 530 per mmbtu on september 5 2007 to a high of 913 per mmbtu on february 6 2007 during 2006 the median daily price at henry hub ranged from a low of 367 per mmbtu on october 2 2006 to a high of 992 per mmbtu on january 4 2006 during 2005 the median daily price at henry hub ranged from a low of 553 per mmbtu on january 4 2005 to a high of 1540 per mmbtu on december 14 2005 the volatility of the price of natural gas in north america compounds our competitive disadvantage to some of our competitors who in addition to having access to lowerpriced natural gas may also benefit from fixedprice natural gas contracts 

as a result of global competition in the fertilizer industry we may not be able to pass along to our customers in the form of higher product prices the higher operating costs we incur due to our dependence on north american natural gas for example due to the high cost of natural gas during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 we curtailed production of fertilizers at our donaldsonville complex because market prices of nitrogen fertilizer were below our cost of production unless differences between the prices for natural gas in north america and other fertilizerproducing regions are reduced or we are able to reduce our dependence on north american natural gas the relatively expensive and highly volatile cost of natural gas in north america could make it difficult for us to compete against producers from other parts of the world

our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our results of operations tend to be negatively impacted 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by population growth changes in dietary habits nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels and planted acreage and application rates among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs government policies and global trade 

periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in new plant investment and increased production causing supply to exceed demand and prices and capacity utilization to decline in particular new ammonia and urea capacity is expected to be added abroad in lowcost regions future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to alleviate any existing or future conditions of excess industry capacity 

during periods of industry oversupply our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in reduced profit margins lower production of our products and possible plant closures 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities 

recent consolidation in the fertilizer industry has increased the resources of several of our competitors and we expect consolidation among fertilizer producers to continue in light of this industry consolidation our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships in the future we may not be able to find suitable assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities we may not be able to acquire desired assets or enter into desired joint ventures or partnerships on economically acceptable terms our inability to compete successfully could result in the loss of customers which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

china is the worlds largest producer and consumer of fertilizers and is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may face increased competition from russian and ukrainian urea which is currently subject to antidumping duty orders that impose significant duties on urea imported into the united states from these two countries the antidumping orders have been in place since 1987 and there has been almost no urea imported into the united states from russia or ukraine since that time russia and ukraine currently have considerable capacity to produce urea and are the worlds largest urea exporters producers in both countries benefit from natural gas prices that are controlled by their governments particularly in russia where the commercial value of the gas is lower than the us encouraging inefficient urea production and exports following a review by the us department of commerce and 

cf industries holdings inc 

the us international trade commission itc the antidumping orders were extended for an additional fiveyear period in november 2005 the decision to extend the orders has been appealed by the russian producers and as part of that appeal process the itc in november 2007 again found that the orders must be continued for a number of reasons including available capacity the attractiveness of the us market and barriers to urea imports in other key consuming markets we expect that if the decision to extend the orders is reversed imports of russian and ukrainian urea into the united states are likely to increase significantly causing our sales and margins to suffer in addition one large russian producer the eurochem group eurochem has requested the department of commerce to review its sales and costs and establish a new antidumping duty rate specifically for them the department of commerce is expected to issue a final decision on the review in may 2008 it is possible that eurochem will receive a significant reduction in its antidumping duty rate and if so the reduction in duties could result in a significant increase in eurochems urea exports to the us 

any decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products 

conditions in the us agricultural industry can significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices the domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products 

state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications for example in recent years ethanol production in the us has increased significantly due in part to federal legislation mandating greater use of renewable fuels this increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the us and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition several states are currently considering limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products 

weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers 

our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the 

cf industries holdings inc 

spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

if seasonal demand exceeds our projections our customers may acquire products from our competitors and our profitability will be negatively impacted if seasonal demand is less than we expect we will be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively impacted by any related storage costs andor liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are particularly acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the highly volatile cost of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers 

our customer base is concentrated with certain large customers accounting for a substantial portion of our sales 

during 2007 three customers chs inc successor to agriliance llc a 5050 joint venture between land olakes inc and chs inc growmark inc and conagra international fertilizer company made combined fertilizer purchases of approximately 11812 million from us representing approximately 43 of our total net sales because we depend on these customers for a significant portion of our sales we may have less flexibility than some of our competitors to diversify our customer base and seek more profitable direct sales to customers of our significant customers any substantial change in purchasing decisions by any or all of these customers whether due to actions by our competitors our actions in expanding the direct sale of fertilizers to the customers of our significant customers or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a change in the use of the forward pricing program by our customers or an increase in the use of product purchases to support the program could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our operating results liquidity and financial condition 

in mid2003 we implemented a forward pricing program through our forward pricing program we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we effectively fix the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our supply cost as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products under our forward pricing program often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment under our forward pricing program customers generally pay a significant portion of the contracts sales value in advance of shipment thereby significantly increasing our liquidity any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with the forward pricing program are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as of december 31 2007 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders under this program equaled approximately 36 of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

we believe the forward pricing program is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices for example in the fourth quarter of 2005 a period during which prices for nitrogen fertilizer products reached then record high levels our orders under the forward pricing program declined significantly as our customers and their customers preferred to defer purchases of fertilizer products rather than commit to purchasing products at such high prices sales under the forward pricing program were lower during 2006 a period of relatively high fertilizer 

cf industries holdings inc 

prices compared to 2005 with forward sales of nitrogen fertilizer products declining from approximately 70 of our nitrogen fertilizer volume during 2005 to approximately 44 in 2006 conversely our customers may also be more willing to increase their use of fpp during periods of rapidly rising fertilizer prices as has been the case in 2007 for example forward sales of nitrogen fertilizer products increased under the forward pricing program in 2007 to approximately 66 of our nitrogen fertilizer volume during a period of rapidly increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizer in environments such as this our profit margins may be lower than if we had not sold our nitrogen fertilizers under the fpp 

the forward pricing program is also less effective at reducing our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins in circumstances where we purchase the fertilizer product from third parties for resale rather than manufacture the product at one of our facilities for example due to the high cost of natural gas in north america during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 we decided to curtail production at our facilities and increase our purchases of fertilizer products originating from offshore lower cost producers for resale to our customers because it is generally not feasible to purchase fertilizer products from these third parties on a forward basis or match purchased quantities with specific order quantities we may not be able to fix our profit margins effectively on fertilizer products that we buy for resale under our forward pricing program one method we use to reduce our margin exposure on sales of purchased products under our forward pricing program is to purchase the required fertilizer products in advance of the specified delivery date however in such circumstances we may be required to buy and store the product sooner and in greater quantities than if produced thereby reducing the liquidity benefits otherwise associated with the forward pricing program it also may not be feasible to purchase sufficient quantities of fertilizer in advance of the specified delivery dates at known acceptable prices thereby reducing or eliminating the expected margins associated with the forward sales 

we also sell phosphate products through our forward pricing program in 2007 forward sales of phosphate fertilizer products represented approximately 42 of our phosphate fertilizer volume unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products where we effectively fix the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of nitrogen costs we do not fix the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate fertilizer costs as a result we are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis 

any significant increase in our purchases of fertilizer products for resale to our customers or any reduction in the use of the forward pricing program by our customers due to changing conditions in the fertilizer market or otherwise could increase our exposure to fluctuating profit margins and could have a material adverse affect our operating results liquidity and financial condition 

our operations are reliant on a limited number of key facilities that involve significant risks and hazards against which we may not be fully insured 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and they may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities for example over the course of the past few years we have been involved in numerous property damage and 

cf industries holdings inc 

personal injury lawsuits arising out of a hydrogen explosion at our donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex in 2000 in which three people died and several others were injured we were also involved in personal injury lawsuits arising out of a train derailment near minot north dakota in 2002 that ruptured five tank cars causing the formation of an ammonia cloud over the area in which one person died and numerous others were injured 

our exposure to these types of risks is increased because of our reliance on a limited number of key facilities our nitrogen fertilizer operations are dependent on our nitrogen fertilizer complex in donaldsonville louisiana and our joint ventures nitrogen fertilizer complex in medicine hat alberta our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on our phosphate mine and associated beneficiation plant in hardee county florida our phosphate fertilizer complex in plant city florida and our ammonia terminal in tampa florida any suspension of operations at any of these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products fulfill our commitments under our forward pricing program and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition all of these facilities other than the complex in medicine hat are located in regions of the united states that experience a relatively high level of hurricane activity such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas and sulfur in the gulf region 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we are subject to various selfretentions and deductibles under these insurance policies as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 

we rely on third party providers of transportation services and equipment which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations 

we rely on railroad trucking pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars from rail car owners in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including extreme weather conditions work stoppages delays spills derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of our raw materials or finished products in addition new regulations could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products 

if we are delayed or unable to ship our finished products or obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our sales revenues andor cost of operations could be adversely affected

expansion of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences 

we recently completed the purchase of a 50 percent interest in keytrade ag a fertilizer trading organization headquartered near zurich switzerland and are considering other possible expansions of our business both domestically and in certain foreign locations acquisitions partnerships joint ventures and other major investments require significant managerial resources which may be diverted from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses 

international acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures or the international expansion of our business involve additional risks and uncertainties including 

• difficulties and costs of complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations • unexpected changes in regulatory environments • political and economic instability including the possibility for civil unrest • nationalization of properties by foreign governments • tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements • the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions and • the impact of exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and foreign currencies in the countries where we operate furthermore acquisitions of businesses or facilities entail a number of additional risks including 

• problems with effective integration of operations • the inability to maintain key preacquisition business relationships • loss of key personnel of businesses we acquire or invest in • exposure to unanticipated liabilities and • difficulties in realizing efficiencies synergies and cost savings these risks of unanticipated adverse consequences from any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented we also face increased exposure to risks related to acquisitions and international operations because our experience with acquisitions and international operations is limited as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other investments 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the united states and canada including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases these laws include the clean air act the clean water act rcra cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes 

cf industries holdings inc 

as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations additionally future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or more vigorous enforcement of current laws and regulations whether caused by violations of environmental and health and safety laws by us or other chemical fertilizer companies or otherwise may require us to make substantial expenditures additionally our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

see item 1 business—environmental health and safety and item 3 legal proceedings for additional information on our environmental and legal matters 

our operations are dependent on numerous required permits and approvals from governmental authorities 

we hold numerous environmental mining and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion of our operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in certain cases as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure the government that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities in march 2006 we established an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection as a means of taking advantage of a safe harbor provision in a 2005 amendment to floridas regulations pertaining to financial assurance requirements for the closure of phosphogypsum stacks additionally florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities the demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds letters of credit insurance policies or similar instruments it is possible that we will not be able to comply with

either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2007 the area permitted by local state and federal authorities for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 54 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current operating rates for approximately 15 years we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated 31 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately nine additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

likewise our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2014 at current operating rates and is subject to regular renewals of our operating permits we have secured the local development authorization to increase the capacity of this stack system based on this authorization estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately eight years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

acts of terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities our plants and ancillary facilities may be targets of terrorist activities many of these plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other items that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations impacting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues andor reduced profit margins 

our operations are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and an increase in the price or any delay or interruption in the delivery of these raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas ammonia and sulfur as raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase these raw materials from thirdparty suppliers prices for these raw materials can fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand for example the price of sulfur has increased from an average of 112 per long ton in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 252 per long ton in the first quarter of 2008 we may not be able to pass along to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials 

cf industries holdings inc 

which could have a material adverse effect on our business these products are transported by barge truck rail or pipeline to our facilities by thirdparty transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw materials including those caused by capacity constraints explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving pipelines deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime or labor difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our investments in securities are subject to risks that may result in losses 

we invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us government those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities our investments are subject to fluctuations in both market value and yield based upon changes in market conditions including interest rates liquidity general economic conditions and conditions specific to the issuers 

at december 31 2007 our shortterm investments were predominantly auction rate securities issued by state local and other governmental entities or guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities they have longterm maturities but the interest rates are reset periodically through an auction process which provides opportunities for holders of the securities to liquidate their positions in february 2008 the market for these securities began to show signs of illiquidity and auctions for several securities failed on their scheduled auction dates as a result we continue to hold investments in certain of these securities these investments for which auctions have failed are no longer liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until such time as an auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process currently the market for these securities continues to show signs of illiquidity and we have not assessed the impact of the illiquid market on the value of the securities it is reasonably possible that a change in the estimated value of these instruments could occur after an evaluation is completed in the future 

due to the risks of investments we may not achieve expected returns we may realize losses on our investments or we may be required to reclassify assets as noncurrent on our consolidated balance sheet any or all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

the loss of key members of our management and professional staff may adversely affect our business 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our senior management and professional staff the loss of one or more key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally if we are unable to find hire and retain needed key personnel in the future our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

environmental 

in december 2004 and january 2005 the united states environmental protection agency epa inspected our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex to evaluate the facilitys compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the federal statute that governs the generation transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous wastes this inspection was undertaken as a part of a broad enforcement initiative commenced by the epa to evaluate whether mineral processing and mining facilities including in particular all wet process phosphoric acid production facilities are in compliance with rcra and the extent to which such facilities waste management practices have impacted the environment 

by letter dated september 27 2005 epa region 4 issued to the company a notice of violation nov and compliance evaluation inspection report the nov and compliance evaluation inspection report alleged a number of violations of rcra including violations relating to recordkeeping the failure to properly make hazardous waste determinations as required by rcra and alleged treatment of sulfuric acid waste without a permit the most significant allegation in the nov is that the plant city facilitys reuse of phosphoric acid process water which is otherwise exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste in the production of ammoniated phosphate fertilizer and the return of this process water to the facilitys process water recirculating system have resulted in the disposal of hazardous waste into the system without a permit the compliance evaluation inspection report indicates that as a result the entire process water system including all pipes ditches cooling ponds and gypsum stacks could be regulated as hazardous waste management units under rcra 

several of our competitors have received novs making this same allegation this particular recycling of process water is common in the industry and the company believes was authorized by the epa in 1990 the company also believes that this allegation is inconsistent with recent case law governing the scope of the epas regulatory authority under rcra if the epas position is eventually upheld the company could incur material expenditures in order to modify its practices or it may be required to comply with regulations applicable to hazardous waste treatment storage or disposal facilities if the company is required to comply with such obligations it could incur material capital 

cf industries holdings inc 

and operating expenditures or may be required to cease operation of the water recirculating system if it is determined that it does not meet rcra standards this would cause a significant disruption of the operations of the plant city facility 

the nov indicated that the company is liable for penalties up to the statutory maximum for example the statutory maximum per day of noncompliance for each violation that occurred after march 15 2004 is 32500 per day although penalties of this magnitude are rarely if ever imposed the company is at risk of incurring substantial civil penalties with respect to these allegations the epa has referred this matter to the united states department of justice doj for enforcement the company has entered into discussions with the doj that have included not only the issues identified in the nov but other operational practices of the company and its competitors the company does not know if this matter will be resolved prior to the commencement of litigation by the united states 

in connection with the rcra enforcement initiative the epa collected samples of soil groundwater and various waste streams at the plant city facility the analysis of the split samples collected by the company during the epas inspection did not identify hazardous waste disposal issues impacting the site the epas sampling results appear to be consistent with the companys results pursuant to a 1992 consent order with the state of florida the company captures and reuses groundwater that has been impacted as a result of the former operation of an unlined gypsum stack at the site although the company believes that it has evaluated and is remediating the impacts resulting from its historic activities the doj and the epa have indicated that they will be seeking additional environmental investigation at the facilities subject to the enforcement initiative including plant city in addition we understand that the epa may decide to inspect our bartow florida property where we formerly manufactured phosphoric acid the epa has requested and the company has provided copies of existing monitoring data for this facility depending on the conclusions that the epa reaches after reviewing this data the epa may require that an investigation of environmental conditions be undertaken at the bartow facility 

on march 19 2007 the company received a letter from the epa under section 114 of the federal clean air act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with new source review new source performance standards and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants at the plant city facility the company responded to this letter with the information requested completing the document production process in late 2007 the epa initiated this same process in relation to numerous other sulfuric acid plants and phosphoric acid plants throughout the nation including other facilities in florida in some cases the epa filed enforcement proceedings asserting that the facilities had not complied with the clean air act to date these enforcement proceedings have been resolved through settlements it is not known at this time whether the epa will initiate enforcement with respect to the plant city facility

our company 

we are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products in north america our operations are organized into two business segments the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business our principal products in the nitrogen fertilizer business are ammonia urea and urea ammonium nitrate solution or uan our principal products in the phosphate fertilizer business are diammonium phosphate or dap and monoammonium phosphate or map for the twelve months ended june 30 2006 the most recent period for which such information is available we supplied approximately 21 of the nitrogen and approximately 14 of the phosphate used in agricultural fertilizer applications in the united states according to the association of american plant food officials our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern us grainproducing states 

our principal assets include 

• the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in north america donaldsonville louisiana • a 66 economic interest in the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in canada which we operate in medicine hat alberta through canadian fertilizers limited or cfl a consolidated variable interest entity • one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer complexes in the united states plant city florida 32

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

through the end of 2002 we operated as a traditional supply cooperative our focus was on providing our preipo owners with an assured supply of fertilizer typically over 80 of our annual sales volume was to our preipo owners though important financial performance was subordinate to our mandated supply objective 

in 2002 we reassessed our corporate mission and adopted a new business model that established financial performance rather than assured supply to our preipo owners as our principal objective a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace under the new business model we began to pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on financial performance one result of this approach was a substantial shift in our customer mix by 2007 our sales to customers other than our preipo owners and western cooperative fertilizers limited westco our joint venture partner in cfl reached approximately 48 of our total sales volume for the year which was more than double the comparable percentage for 2002 

cf holdings was formed as a delaware corporation in april 2005 to hold the existing businesses of cf industries inc on august 16 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock we sold 47437500 shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 7154 million we did not retain any of the proceeds from our ipo in connection with our ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction in which cf industries inc ceased to be a cooperative and became our whollyowned subsidiary in the reorganization transaction all of the equity interests in cf industries inc were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the ipo and 7562499 shares of our common stock in connection with our ipo the following significant items occurred 

• in august of 2005 we replaced our 140 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a 250 million senior secured revolving credit facility also in august of 2005 we repaid in full 2356 million of our term notes plus associated prepayment penalties and accrued interest in the amount of 293 million with cash on hand and by liquidating shortterm investments prior to that date we made principal payments of 07 million and 100 million on their scheduled maturity dates in connection with these transactions we incurred a 171 million charge after taxes related to the prepayment penalties associated with the repayment of our long term debt 160 million and a noncash charge of 11 million after taxes related to the writeoff of unamortized financing fees related to our previous senior secured revolving credit facility and long term debt • also in connection with our ipo our board of directors adopted a plan under which we grant stockbased awards to our officers employees and nonemployee directors and terminated a previous longterm incentive plan in 2007 2006 and 2005 stockbased awards were granted under this plan also we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r— sharebased payment  which requires us to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards as a result the total aftertax stockbased compensation cost recognized for 2007 2006 and 2005 was 61 million 50 million and 22 million respectively most of the stockbased compensation cost was recorded as 34

selling general and administrative expenses we did not have stockbased awards prior to our initial public offering see the critical accounting policies and estimates section later in this discussion and analysis for additional information on stockbased compensation 

• in connection with our ipo we also recorded a charge to the income tax provision of 999 million to reduce to zero what remained of the gross deferred tax asset related to cf industries incs net operating loss carryforwards nols as of august 16 2005 cf industries incs last day as a cooperative those net operating loss carryforwards were generated from business conducted with cf industries incs preipo owners while cf industries inc was a cooperative in connection with our ipo we entered into an nol agreement with the preipo owners of cf industries inc which provides that in the event that it is finally determined by the applicable taxing jurisdictions that cf industries incs preipo nols can be utilized we will pay the preipo owners an amount equal to the federal and state income taxes saved by the utilization of the preipo nols see notes 11 and 31 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of the nol agreement postipo significant items 

after our ipo in the latter part of 2005 hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico region during the latter portion of 2005 significantly affected the domestic fertilizer industry these hurricanes caused substantial damage to the natural gas production and distribution facilities in the region affecting the supply and price of natural gas the primary raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers by the end of the first quarter of 2006 natural gas prices had moderated returning to approximately prehurricane levels these storms also affected the availability of barges used to transport urea and dapmap on the mississippi river and adversely affected the supply of sulfur a raw material used in the production of phosphate fertilizers by causing refinery closures and transportation disruptions 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we ceased classifying natural gas derivatives as cash flow hedges as defined in sfas no 133— accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  as a result realized and unrealized gains or losses related to our derivatives are now recognized in operations as they occur cash flow hedges existing at the time we discontinued hedge accounting were dedesignated as cash flow hedges despite our change in accounting treatment the execution and attendant economic consequences of our hedging activities have not changed in that derivatives are still being used to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on forward pricing program fpp nitrogen sales however because of our change in accounting treatment gains or losses on natural gas hedges may not be realized in the same period as the fpp sale to which they relate we also establish natural gas derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our fpp see note 25 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of derivative financial instruments 

we implemented financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 47— accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin no 47 in the fourth quarter of 2005 this interpretation of sfas no 143— accounting for asset retirement obligations requires us to recognize a liability for asset retirement obligations aros associated with our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain we identified conditional aros for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities consequently we recognized an increase in aro liabilities of 46 million and an increase in deferred tax assets of 18 million resulting in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of 

cf industries holdings inc 

28 million that decreased net earnings see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of aros 

the domestic nitrogen fertilizer business in 2006 was characterized by adverse conditions early in the year due to the remaining impacts from the 2005 hurricane season and its impact on natural gas pricing due to damage experienced by gulf of mexico gas producers later in the year natural gas prices fell and a tight international market for fertilizer products and an expectation of a stronger planting season in early 2007 led to a stabilization in overall pricing results for our phosphate business in 2006 were impacted favorably by increased domestic demand and stable international conditions consolidated net sales increased 650 million or 33 in 2006 to 20 billion with increases in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments gross margin declined by 620 million or 30 to 1472 million our 2006 gross margin was impacted by a 307 million pretax charge for unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives and a pretax charge of 216 million for adjustments to aros and demolition costs primarily related to our closed bartow florida complex late in 2006 management committed to a plan to relocate its corporate office to deerfield illinois the move was completed in the first quarter of 2007 

both the nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer businesses in 2007 were favorably impacted by improved demand and pricing as a robust agricultural economy characterized by strong domestic and international grain markets produced high global demand for fertilizer increasing demand pushed average selling prices higher as the year progressed consolidated net sales increased by 7238 million or 36 to 28 billion in 2007 with increases coming in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments gross margin increased by 5228 million in 2007 our 2007 gross margin included a 170 million pretax unrealized marktomarket gain on natural gas derivatives 

during 2007 we completed the purchase of a 50 interest in keytrade ag keytrade a global fertilizer trading company for 259 million and purchased certain preferred stock in keytrade for 09 million the investment in keytrade provides us with a global platform for marketing and sourcing fertilizer under this arrangement we utilize keytrade as our exclusive exporter of phosphate fertilizer products from north america and keytrade is now our exclusive importer of uan products into north america we also provided 128 million in subordinated financing for keytrade under notes that will mature in september 2017 we report keytrade as an equity method investment 

we periodically review the depreciable lives assigned to our production facilities and related assets as well as estimated production capacities used to develop our unitsofproduction uop depreciation expense and we change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews in the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed such a review and as a result we increased the depreciable lives of certain assets at our nitrogen production facilities from ten years to fifteen years separately we revised the estimates of production capacities for certain uop assets at our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex and all uop assets at our plant city florida phosphate complex the effect of this change in estimate for the twelve months ended december 31 2007 was an increase in earnings before income taxes of 103 million an increase in net earnings of 67 million and an increase in diluted earnings per share of 012 

key industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on 

cf industries holdings inc 

customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply  demand 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key consumingexporting countries such as china india or brazil often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs government policies and global trade 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea and uan because all of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses expenditures on natural gas comprised approximately 50 of the total cost of our nitrogen fertilizer sales in 2007 and a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization 

farmers economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns and the types of crops planted fertilizer demand has increased in response to increased corn acreage planted to support the growing ethanol industry 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters changes in currency values alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east the former soviet union the republic of trinidad and tobago and venezuela are major exporters to north america 

the domestic phosphate fertilizer industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world 

cf industries holdings inc 

market including fertilizer andor trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations to name a few 

political and social government policies 

the political and social policies of governments around the world can result in the restriction of imports the subsidization of domestic producers andor the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives 

factors affecting our results 

net sales our net sales are derived from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers 

cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs product purchases and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials maintenance direct labor and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers 

in mid2003 we instituted a margin risk management approach utilizing our forward pricing program fpp which allows us to manage some of the risks created by the volatility of fertilizer prices and natural gas costs through our fpp we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost using natural gas derivative instruments in the third quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 due to the increased volatility of natural gas prices we fulfilled a significant amount of fpp orders with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases rather than with manufactured product see forward pricing program later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products under our fpp often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

selling general and administrative expenses our selling general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes insurance and professional service fees our selling general and administrative expenses have increased as a result of the consummation of our ipo these expenses include additional legal and corporate governance expenses stockbased awards salary and payrollrelated costs for additional accounting staff director compensation exchange listing fees transfer agent and stockholderrelated fees and increased premiums for director and officer liability insurance coverage 

other operating—net other operating—net includes the costs associated with our closed bartow phosphate facility and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations bartow facility 

cf industries holdings inc 

costs include provisions for phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond closure costs water treatment costs and costs associated with the cessation of operations the term other costs refers to amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business litigation expenses gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets and impairment charges for goodwill 

interest expense our interest expense includes the interest on our longterm debt and notes payable annual fees on our senior secured revolving credit facility and amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements 

interest income our interest income represents amounts earned on our cash cash equivalents investments and advances to unconsolidated affiliates

we operate the medicine hat facility and purchase approximately 66 of the facilitys ammonia and urea production pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either us or cfl upon a twelvemonth notice westco has the right but not the obligation to purchase the remaining 34 of the facilitys ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement to the extent that westco does not purchase its 34 of the facilitys production we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts since 1995 however westco has purchased at least 34 of the facilitys production each year 

under the product purchase agreements both we and westco pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases however the product purchase agreements also provide that cfl will distribute its net earnings to us and westco annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from cfl the distributions to westco are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows as we consider these payments to be similar to dividends our product purchase agreement also requires us to advance funds to cfl in the event that cfl is unable to meet its debts as they become due the amount of each advance would be related to the amount of product we purchase or at least 66 of the deficiency and would be more in any year in which we purchased more than 66 of medicine hats production a similar obligation also exists for westco we and westco currently manage cfl such that each party is responsible for its share of cfls fixed costs and that cfls production volume meets the parties combined requirements the management agreement the product purchase agreements and any other agreements related to cfl are subject to change with the consent of both parties 

income taxes our income tax provision includes all currently payable and deferred united states and canadian income tax expense applicable to our ongoing operations 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a

upon the completion of our ipo cf industries inc ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes on the date of our ipo cf industries inc had a deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards generated from business conducted with cf industries incs preipo owners these net operating loss carryforwards totaled 250 million with expirations ranging from 2021 through 2023 the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2005 includes a charge of 999 million to establish a 100 valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to these nols the valuation allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset will be realized since cf industries inc is no longer a cooperative for federal income tax purposes 

in connection with the ipo we entered into a net operating loss agreement with cf industries incs preipo owners nol agreement relating to the future treatment of the preipo nols under the nol agreement if it is finally determined that cf industries incs net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized subsequent to the ipo we will pay to cf industries incs preipo owners an amount equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved

consolidated operating results 

increased domestic demand coupled with tight domestic and international markets drove strong financial performance in the domestic nitrogen industry in 2007 as compared to the prior year demand increased due to an increase in corn acreage planted higher spring season application rates a strong fall application season driven by favorable weather conditions and expectations of a strong spring season in 2008 operating results in our phosphate fertilizer business improved due to tight domestic supplydemand conditions strong worldwide demand and increased domestic demand in the fall our total gross margin increased by 5228 million to 6700 million for 2007 from a gross margin of 1472 million for 2006 the increase was due largely to higher average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices favorable unrealized marktomarket adjustments on natural gas derivatives and higher nitrogen fertilizer sales volume partially offset by higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs net earnings of 3727 million for 2007 included a net pretax unrealized marktomarket gain of 170 million 110 million after tax on natural gas derivatives and a pretax charge of 10 million 07 million after tax for changes in estimates to our asset retirement obligations aros and demolition costs net earnings of 333 million for 2006 included a pretax charge of 307 million 187 million after tax for unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives and a pretax charge of 216 million 131 million after tax for adjustments to aros and demolition costs primarily related to our closed bartow florida complex 

net sales 

our net sales were 28 billion for 2007 or 7238 million higher than net sales for 2006 due largely to higher average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices and an increase in nitrogen sales volume our total sales volume increased 6 to 89 million tons for 2007 versus 84 million tons for 2006 nitrogen fertilizer sales volume in 2007 increased 628000 tons or 10 to 69 million tons for 2007 compared to 63 million tons in 2006 due to increased domestic demand and our customers anticipation of a strong spring season in 2008 our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales was 20 million tons for 2007 slightly below the 21 million tons sold in 2006 average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices for 2007 were 22 and 46 higher respectively than the prices for similar products in 2006 reflecting overall tight market conditions and increased domestic demand 

cf industries holdings inc 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged 230 per ton for 2007 compared to 226 per ton in 2006 an increase of 2 this increase was largely due to higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs partially offset by favorable unrealized marktomarket adjustments on natural gas derivatives phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged 247 per ton for 2007 compared to 221 per ton in the prior year an increase of 12 this increase was due mainly to higher purchased product costs where we purchase finished goods to supplement our production and higher phosphate rock costs 

during 2007 we sold approximately 54 million tons of fertilizer under our fpp representing approximately 60 of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period in 2006 we sold approximately 30 million tons of fertilizer under this program representing approximately 36 of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 20 to 652 million in 2007 compared to 545 million in 2006 the yearoveryear increase in expense for 2007 resulted largely from the increased expenses related to performancebased shortterm management incentive compensation expenses related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to deerfield illinois increased compensation costs associated with our longterm stockbased compensation expenses related to our keytrade investment and certain software implementation costs

interest—net increased to 227 million of net interest income in 2007 from 96 million of net interest income in 2006 interest income increased to 244 million in 2007 from 125 million in 2006 due to higher average balances of invested cash partially offset by lower average rates of return the decrease in the average rates of return is due to substantially all of our shortterm investments for 2007 

cf industries holdings inc 

being in securities that are exempt from federal taxation interest expense decreased 41 to 17 million in 2007 from 29 million in 2006 this decrease was primarily due to 10 million of interest expense recorded in the second quarter of 2006 related to a canadian income tax matter

consolidated operating results 

in 2006 the domestic nitrogen fertilizer industry was characterized by adverse conditions early in the year remaining from the 2005 effects of hurricanes katrina and rita more moderate conditions through the fall and strength late in the year fueled by lower natural gas prices a tight international market and expectations of a strong planting season in the spring of 2007 the first half of 2006 was unfavorably impacted by high natural gas prices during the first quarter of the year and reduced demand during the spring planting season results during 2006 for our phosphate fertilizer business were affected positively by increased domestic demand and relatively balanced international supplydemand conditions our total gross margin decreased by approximately 620 million or 30 to 1472 million for 2006 compared to a gross margin of 2092 million for 2005 the net earnings of 333 million for 2006 included a pretax charge of 307 million for unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives and a pretax charge of 216 million for adjustments to aros and demolition costs primarily related to our closed bartow florida complex the net loss of 390 million for 2005 included a 999 million charge to record a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to cf industries incs net operating loss carryforwards generated during preipo years a 283 million loss on the extinguishment of debt a gain of approximately 140 million associated with the early termination of certain natural gas hedge positions a pretax charge of 93 million for unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives a pretax charge of 128 million for

upward adjustments to aros primarily related to our closed bartow florida complex and a 61 million tax benefit from a refund of canadian income taxes 

net sales 

our net sales were 20 billion for both 2006 and 2005 lower nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes were offset by higher average selling prices for ammonia and phosphate fertilizers in 2006 nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 119000 tons or 2 to 63 million tons for 2006 compared to 64 million tons in 2005 due primarily to the cessation of production by us agrichemicals to whom we had sold ammonia previously our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales of 21 million tons for 2006 approximated the amount sold in 2005 nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer prices for 2006 averaged 3 and 7 higher respectively than the prices for similar products in 2005 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged 226 per ton for 2006 compared to 207 per ton in 2005 an increase of 9 primarily due to higher natural gas costs and higher purchased product costs phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged 221 per ton for 2006 compared to 211 per ton in the prior year an increase of 5 mainly due to higher ammonia and sulfur costs 

during 2006 we sold approximately 30 million tons of fertilizer under our fpp representing approximately 36 of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period in 2005 we sold approximately 52 million tons of fertilizer under this program representing approximately 62 of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period the lower level of fpp sales volumes in 2006 reflected the hesitancy of our customers during the last half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 to make commitments during the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during those periods 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 4 to 545 million in 2006 compared to 570 million in 2005 the yearoveryear decrease in expense for 2006 resulted largely from the absence of expenses related to our august 2005 ipo including expenses associated with the termination of a longterm incentive plan upon completion of our ipo this decrease was partially offset by additional stockbased compensation expense and additional administrative expenses associated with being a publicly held company

net sales nitrogen fertilizer net sales increased 34 to 20 billion in 2007 compared to 15 billion in 2006 due to higher average selling prices as well as higher sales volume the 7 increase in average ammonia selling prices for 2007 arising mainly in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by tight supplies heading into the quarter and a strong fall application season higher average urea selling prices reflected continued strong domestic and international demand the 25 increase in average uan selling prices for 2007 compared to 2006 reflected strong domestic demand and a tight supplydemand balance nitrogen fertilizer sales volume increased 10 to 69 million tons in 2007 compared to 63 million tons in 2006 the increase was due to the impact of an increase in corn acres planted and higher fertilizer application rates in the spring as well as a strong fall ammonia application season and demand in anticipation of a strong spring 2008 planting season the increase in corn acreage was driven by greater demand by ethanol producers low corn inventories and continued strong demand for feed 

cost of sales total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged 230 per ton for 2007 compared to 226 per ton for 2006 an increase of 2 largely due to higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs partially offset by favorable unrealized marktomarket adjustments on natural gas derivatives the costs of finished fertilizer products purchased for resale were approximately 576 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 due to an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by purchased products as well as the overall increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices both factors occurring mainly during the last six months of 2007 the overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied to our donaldsonville facility and cfls medicine hat facility including realized gains and losses on derivatives increased by 4 in 2007 versus the cost in 2006 the increase in realized gas costs was due mainly to greater net realized losses on our natural gas derivatives 

we carry our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur we recognized a net 170 million unrealized marktomarket gain in 2007 compared to a net 307 million unrealized marktomarket loss in 2006

year ended december 31 2006 compared to year ended december 31 2005 

net sales nitrogen fertilizer net sales were 15 billion for both 2006 and 2005 as higher average ammonia selling prices in 2006 were for the most part offset by lower sales volume nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 2 to 63 million tons in 2006 compared to 64 million tons in 2005 ammonia and uan sales volumes decreased by 11 and 3 respectively for 2006 compared to the prior year while urea sales volume increased by 4 ammonia sales volumes decreased due primarily to lower sales from our tampa terminal due to us agrichemicals a former customer ceasing phosphate operations in 2005 increases in industry consumption in the fall in anticipation of strong corn and wheat prices offset a spring during which the industry experienced fewer corn acres planted and reduced application rates the decrease in uan sales compared to sales for 2005 was due primarily to less corn acreage planted and reduced demand in the southern portion of the country due to drought conditions both experienced during the first half of 2006 the impact of these factors was partially offset by strong summer and fall fill demand resulting from the anticipation of a stronger uan market later in 2006 and into the spring of 2007 ammonia sales prices increased by 14 for 2006 compared

to the prior year primarily due to tight world market conditions and strong fourth quarter domestic demand 

cost of sales total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged 226 per ton for 2006 compared to 207 per ton for 2005 an increase of 9 largely due to realized losses and unfavorable unrealized marktomarket adjustments related to natural gas derivatives and higher purchased product costs while the overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied to our donaldsonville facility and cfls medicine hat facility decreased by 1 for 2006 versus the cost in 2005 the favorable effect of this variance was more than offset by the impact of the realized losses on natural gas derivatives immediately recognized in cost of sales we recognized 307 million of unrealized marktomarket losses on derivatives in 2006 compared to 93 million in 2005 due to our discontinuing hedge accounting in the last quarter of 2005 and the decline in natural gas prices that occurred during the respective periods we also recorded approximately 140 million of hedge gains in 2005 mainly in the third quarter the costs of finished fertilizer products purchased for resale were approximately 89 million higher in 2006 than in 2005 due to the overall increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices as well as an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by purchased products both factors occurring mainly during the first six months of 2006 see the overview section of this discussion and analysis for additional information about the impact of accounting for our natural gas derivatives

cost of sales phosphate cost of sales averaged 247 per ton for 2007 compared to 221 per ton for 2006 the 12 increase was due mainly to higher purchased product costs and higher phosphate rock costs as well as higher sulfur costs purchased product costs were approximately 134 million higher in 2007 than in the same period of 2006 primarily due to an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by purchased products mainly occurring during the second quarter of 2007 higher perton phosphate rock mining costs were due to fewer tons mined in 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting from unfavorable mining conditions as well as higher earthmoving costs for land management average annual sulfur costs increased by 10 for 2007 compared to 2006 the increase mainly occurring in the fourth quarter of 2007 reflected the impact of a strengthening domestic sulfur market fueled by strong demand and insufficient supply we expect the domestic and international sulfur markets to remain tight in 2008 due to strong anticipated demand from phosphate fertilizer and metal producers 

during 2007 we sold approximately 835000 tons of phosphate fertilizer under our fpp representing approximately 42 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period in 2006 we sold approximately 294000 tons of phosphate fertilizer under this program representing approximately 14 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period

net sales phosphate fertilizer net sales increased 11 to 5110 million for 2006 compared to 4611 million in 2005 due to higher average selling prices and increased sales volumes average phosphate fertilizer prices during 2006 increased by 7 compared to prices in 2005 due to the impact of increased domestic demand on what was already a relatively tight supplydemand balance our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales volumes of 21 million tons in 2006 increased by 4 over the prior years level due primarily to stronger domestic demand for dap during the second half of the year during the fourth quarter of 2006 we made our first dap export sales through phoschem an export association representing north american phosphate producers we joined phoschem in october of 2006 approximately 22 of our 2006 fourth quarter phosphate fertilizer net sales were made through phoschem 

cost of sales phosphate cost of sales averaged 221 per ton for 2006 compared to 211 per ton for 2005 the 5 increase was mainly due to higher ammonia and sulfur costs ammonia prices increased by 6 during 2006 compared to 2005 reflecting stronger global market conditions through the first half of 2006 sulfur costs increased by 3 for 2006 compared to 2005 the increase mainly occurring in the first six months of 2006 reflected the lingering impact of supply disruptions that occurred in 2005 due to hurricane activity

shortterm investments 

we had shortterm investments of 4945 million as of december 31 2007 and 3002 million as of december 31 2006 in 2007 our shortterm investments generally were availableforsale tax exempt auction rate securities auction rate securities primarily are debt instruments with longterm maturities for which interest rates are reset periodically through an auction process which typically occurs every 7 to 35 days the auction process results in the interest rate being reset on the underlying securities until the next reset or auction date this date is also referred to as the remarketing date since the holder of the instrument can decide at each auction date to continue to hold the security or allow others to bid for it resulting in liquidation of the original holders position parties bid for these instruments and the lowest interest rate that places all of the securities offered for auction becomes the interest rate earned until the next auction date a failed auction occurs when there are insufficient bids for the number of instruments being offered when a failed auction occurs the present holders of the instruments continue to hold them until the next auction date upon a failed auction the instrument carries an interest rate based upon certain predefined formulas or a fixed rate 

on december 31 2007 the auction rate securities that we held were issued by various state or local governmental entities including securities that are backed by student loans that are guaranteed under the federal family education loan program through february 5 2008 we had not experienced any failed auctions in these securities and subsequent to december 31 2007 through february 5 2008 we sold certain of these investments through the auction process in february 2008 the market for these securities began to show signs of illiquidity and auctions for several securities failed on their scheduled auction dates as a result we continue to hold investments in certain of these securities these investments for which auctions have failed are no longer liquid investments and we will not be able to access these funds until such time as an auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process in accordance with our policies we review the underlying securities and assess the creditworthiness of these investments in each case our review found these investments to be investment grade and in compliance with our investment policy 

at february 22 2008 we continue to hold 276 million of investments in auction rate securities and for 159 million of this amount the most recent auction failed we believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets supporting the auction rate securities has not been impacted by the current market illiquidity currently the market continues to show signs of illiquidity and we have not assessed the impact of the illiquid market on the value of the securities it is reasonably possible that a change 

cf industries holdings inc 

in the estimated value of these instruments could occur after an evaluation is completed in the future for those instruments with recent failed auctions we believe we have the ability to hold these securities until market liquidity returns and the auction process resumes and we presently intend to hold the securities until such time we do not believe the current market liquidity issues in these securities present any operating liquidity issues for the company 

we believe that our cash cash equivalents short term investments operating cash flow and credit available under our credit facilities are adequate to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 

debt 

notes payable representing amounts owed by cfl to its minority interest holder with respect to advances were 49 million as of december 31 2007 and 42 million as of december 31 2006 there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under our 250 million credit facility as of december 31 2007 or december 31 2006 

on august 16 2005 we replaced our 140 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a new 250 million credit facility the credit facility as amended on september 7 2005 and july 31 2007 is scheduled to be available until july 31 2012 and bears interest at a variable rate this facility is secured by working capital certain equipment and the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex our investment in and advances to keytrade will be pledged as security under our credit facility the credit facility provides up to 250 million subject to a borrowing base for working capital and general corporate purposes including up to 50 million for the issuance of letters of credit as of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 we had 2198 million and 1764 million available respectively under our credit facility see note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information concerning this credit facility 

investment in keytrade 

in october 2007 we purchased 50 of the common shares of keytrade ag keytrade a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near zurich switzerland for 259 million we also purchased certain nonvoting preferred shares of keytrade for 09 million and contributed an additional 128 million in subordinated financing the subordinated financing is in the form of notes that mature september 30 2017 and bear interest at libor plus 100 the investment in keytrade provides us with a global platform for marketing and sourcing fertilizer under the terms of a commercial agreement we executed with keytrade concurrent with our investment we utilize keytrade as our exclusive exporter of phosphate fertilizer products from north america and as our exclusive importer of uan products into north america we terminated our previous membership in phoschem and no longer utilize them to export phosphate fertilizers we account for keytrade as an equity method investment see note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information concerning the keytrade investment 

capital spending 

capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity and to improve plant efficiency in response to the difficult industry environment prior to 2004 we had deferred nonessential capital expenditures whenever it was possible to do so without compromising the operational integrity of our facilities or the safety of our employees of the 455 million increase in capital expenditures in 2007 as compared to 2006 approximately 24 million related to plant and equipment expenditures and 22 million related to greater plant turnaround activity during 2007 we 

cf industries holdings inc 

expect to spend approximately 140 million to 170 million on capital expenditures in both 2008 and 2009 the projection for 2008 includes approved spending on longterm projects initiated in 2007 and earlier these amounts also include approximately 17 million in 2008 and 30 million in 2009 for capital expenditures at cfl of which we are obligated to fund 66 

forward pricing program fpp 

we offer a fpp to our customers under which product may be ordered for future delivery with a significant portion of the sales proceeds generally being collected before the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales as of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 we had approximately 3058 million and 1027 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 we had approximately 30 million and 17 million tons of product respectively committed to be sold under the fpp most of this product was scheduled to ship within 150 days of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively 

customer advances were a significant source of liquidity and cash flow from operations in 2007 the level of sales under the fpp is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers perceptions of future market fundamentals the higher level of sales on order as of december 31 2007 reflects our customers expectations concerning the fertilizer pricing environment and availability of supply prevalent during that reporting period 

the level of our customers participation in our fpp may vary over time should the level of participation decrease there is a risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings and timing of cash flow of future periods if the level of sales under the fpp were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase also borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future fpp sales activity 

financial assurance requirements 

in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate fertilizer business we are subject to financial assurance requirements previously these financial assurance requirements were satisfied without the need for any advance expenditure of corporate funds provided our financial statements met certain criteria referred to as the financial tests however pursuant to a 2005 amendment to the florida regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure of phosphogypsum stacks we established an escrow account to meet such future obligations this was done in order to take advantage of a safe harbor provision in the regulations that would obviate the need for us to meet the financial test criteria in the future we made annual contributions of 94 million and 111 million in february of 2007 and march of 2006 respectively to this escrow account which by rule is earmarked to cover the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure in the first quarter of 2008 we expect to contribute another 62 million over the subsequent eight years we expect to contribute between 40 million and 50 million annually based upon the required funding formula as defined in the regulations and an assumed rate of return of 4 on invested funds the amount of money that will accumulate in the account by the year 2016 including interest earned on invested funds is currently estimated to be approximately 79 million after 2016 contributions to the account are estimated to average less than 30 million annually for the following 17 years the balance in the account is estimated to be approximately 212 million by 2033 the amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in note 9 to our 

cf industries holdings inc 

consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data these expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the account which are based on the guidelines set forth in the florida regulations ultimately the cash in this account will be used to settle the asset retirement obligations 

additionally florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities we will be subject to this requirement if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted the demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a cash deposit arrangement based on these current regulations we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in florida utilizing either of these methods 

other liquidity requirements 

we paid cash dividends of 45 million on outstanding common stock during 2007 this amount represents an annual rate equal to 008 per common share in february of 2008 our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend from 002 to 010 per common share we expect to pay quarterly dividends at such a rate for the foreseeable future under certain conditions our 250 million credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends 

we also funded contributions to our us and canadian pension plans totaling 120 million in 2007 we expect to contribute 80 million to our pension plans in 2008

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer and a corporate office lease the rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to five years and the barge charter commitments currently have terms ranging from one to three years we also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements at several of our distribution locations some of which contain minimum throughput requirements the storage agreements contain minimum terms ranging from one to three years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party 

in 2006 we entered into a tenyear operating lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters located in deerfield il the corporate office lease agreement includes leasehold incentives rent holidays and scheduled rent increases that are expensed on a straightline basis in accordance with sfas no 13— accounting for leases our other operating lease agreements do not contain significant contingent rents leasehold incentives rent holidays scheduled rent increases concessions or unusual provisions see note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information concerning leases 

we do not have any other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when title is transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statement of operations 

assets held for sale 

in 2006 we decided to sell our corporate office facility located in long grove illinois and in 2007 we relocated our corporate headquarters to deerfield illinois as of december 31 2007 the net book value of the long grove building and related land 67 million are classified as assets held for sale at the time the asset was classified as an asset held for sale the estimated selling price less the cost to sell the facility was in excess of the book value as a result no loss was recognized see note 15 to our

useful lives of depreciable assets 

property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation is computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction uop method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers estimates engineering or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews 

at the end of 2006 we completed a comprehensive review of the depreciable lives of our production facilities and related assets as well as estimated production capacities used to develop our uop depreciation expense as a result of this review we increased the depreciable lives of certain assets at our nitrogen production facilities from ten years to fifteen years separately we revised the estimates of production capacities for certain uop assets at our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex and all uop assets at our plant city florida phosphate complex as a result of these changes depreciation expense was reduced by 115 million for 2007 

of the 115 million reduction in depreciation expense 101 million relates to our nitrogen production assets and 14 million relates to our phosphate production assets included in the 101 million decrease in depreciation for nitrogen assets was 12 million relating to cfl a joint venture of which we own 66 

the effect of this change in estimate for 2007 was an increase in earnings before income taxes of 103 million an increase in net earnings of 67 million and an increase in diluted earnings per share of 012 of the 103 million reduction in depreciation expense approximately 90 million related to our nitrogen production assets and 13 million related to our phosphate production assets 

inventory valuation 

we review our inventory balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operational plans for the inventory and historical price activity of inventory if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we would immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales price ultimately realized were less than our initial estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation 

asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation liabilities 

costs associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the bartow and plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complexes and costs associated with land reclamation activities at our hardee florida phosphate rock mine are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 143— accounting for asset retirement obligations  if the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated asset retirement obligations aros are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service costs associated with the cessation of operations at all of our facilities are accounted for in accordance with fin no 47— accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  this interpretation requires us to recognize a liability for aros for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain the obligations related to closure reclamation and cessation of operations are capitalized at 

cf industries holdings inc 

their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded the liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time the asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over their estimated useful life the aggregate carrying value of all of our aros was 894 million as of december 31 2007 and 871 million as of december 31 2006 the increase in the aggregate carrying value of these aros is due to recording changes in estimates and normal accretion expense on existing aros as previously discussed 

environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated consistent with the requirements of sfas no 5— accounting for contingencies  estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts existing technology sitespecific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations in reporting environmental liabilities no offset is made for potential recoveries all liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur in accordance with gaap environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits changes in laws regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements the amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled 81 million as of december 31 2007 and 94 million as of december 31 2006 

the actual amounts to be spent on aros and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments and cost inflation as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

recoverability of longlived assets 

we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment on a regular basis in accordance with sfas no 144— accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  if impairment of an asset has occurred an impairment charge is recognized immediately factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume prices inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the recoverability of the values associated with our longlived assets is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and nonoperating—net respectively 

upon the completion of our ipo cf industries inc ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes on the date of our ipo cf industries inc had a deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards nols generated from business conducted with cf industries incs preipo owners these net operating loss carryforwards totaled 250 million with expirations ranging from 2021 through 2023 the income tax provision for the year ended 

cf industries holdings inc 

december 31 2005 includes a charge of 999 million to establish a 100 valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to these nols the valuation allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset will be realized since cf industries inc is no longer a cooperative for federal income tax purposes 

in connection with the ipo we entered into a net operating loss agreement with cf industries incs preipo owners nol agreement relating to the future treatment of the preipo nols under the nol agreement if it is finally determined that cf industries incs net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized subsequent to the ipo we will pay to cf industries incs preipo owners an amount equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 2454 million at december 31 2007 which was 156 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2007 pbo was computed based on a 600 discount rate which was based on yields for highquality corporate bonds aa rated or better with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension liability declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 171 million higher than the amount previously discussed conversely if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 154 million lower the discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2007 was 570 if the discount rate used to compute 2007 pension expense was lower by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 18 million higher than the amount calculated conversely if the discount rate used to compute 2007 pension expense was higher by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 16 million lower than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 72 expected longterm rate of return on assets is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher by 50 basis points pension expense for 2007 would have been 10 million lower conversely if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2007 would have been 10 million higher see note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our pension plans

retiree medical benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions including discount rates used to compute the present value of the future obligations and expected increases in health care costs changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs affect the recorded amount of retiree medical benefits expense 

stockbased compensation 

costs associated with stockbased compensation are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 123r— sharebased payment sfas 123r which requires us to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards over the service period the fair value of nonqualified stock options granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the black 

cf industries holdings inc 

scholes option valuation model key assumptions used in the blackscholes option valuation model include expected volatility and expected life the expected volatility used to value most of the stock options granted in 2007 was 36 if the expected volatility was 2 higher or lower the fair value of the stock options would have been 35 higher or lower respectively the expected life of most of the stock options granted in 2007 was 57 years if the expected life was 05 years higher or lower the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 45 higher or lower respectively the basis for determining these assumptions may change as more experience is obtained with our own historical stock prices and employees option exercise behavior 

we accrue the cost of stockbased awards on the straightline method over the applicable vesting period as a result total compensation cost recognized for 2007 on a pretax basis was 97 million as of december 31 2007 on a pretax basis there was approximately 80 million and 24 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonqualified options and restricted stock which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 14 and 16 years respectively see note 27 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of stockbased compensation 

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest as well as variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary our judgment in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our level of involvement in setting up the entity determining whether the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on our behalf determining whether we provide more than half the subordinated financial support to the entity and determining whether we absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses or returns 

we use the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions 

we eliminate from financial results all significant intercompany transactions

forward pricing program fpp 

in mid2003 we instituted a program that has reduced the risk inherent in the relationship between volatile fertilizer prices and natural gas costs for product that we manufacture our basic concept when applied to nitrogen fertilizers is to fix the price of our principal raw material natural gas coincident with the establishment of the fertilizer sales price which often occurs months in advance of shipment customer advances which typically represent a significant portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with the fpp are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as is the case for all of our sales transactions revenue is recognized when title transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost using natural gas derivative instruments or in some cases with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases 

during 2007 we sold approximately 46 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer representing approximately 66 of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume and approximately 835000 tons of phosphate fertilizer representing approximately 42 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume under the fpp in 2006 we sold approximately 27 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer representing approximately 44 of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume and approximately 294000 tons of phosphate fertilizer representing approximately 14 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume under the fpp during 2005 we sold approximately 45 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer representing approximately 70 of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume and approximately 718000 tons of phosphate fertilizer representing approximately 36 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume under the fpp as of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 we had approximately 30 million tons of product and 17 million tons of product respectively committed to be sold under this program most of these amounts were scheduled to ship within 150 days of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively 

as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products and a substantial portion of the cost to manufacture the nitrogen products under our fpp often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

participation in the fpp is affected by market conditions and our customers expectations there can be no assurance that we will transact the same percentage of our business under the fpp in the future should the level of participation decrease there is a risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings of future periods 

discussion of seasonality impacts on operations 

our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

interest rate fluctuations 

borrowings under variable rate notes payable bear a current market rate of interest such that we are subject to interest rate risk on these items the credit facility bears a similar risk but as of december 31 2007 there were no borrowings under this facility as of december 31 2007 a 100 basis point change in interest rates on our floating rate loans which totaled 49 million would result in a 49000 change in pretax earnings on an annual basis 

as of december 31 2007 we had shortterm investments of 4945 million consisting primarily of availableforsale tax exempt auction rate securities that we intend to hold over periods ranging from one to twelve months a 100 basis point change in the average rate of interest earned on these shortterm investments would result in a 49 million change in pretax income on an annual basis our advances to unconsolidated affiliates consisted of floating rate subordinated debt owed to us by keytrade totaling 150 million swiss francs chf 132 million as of december 31 2007 a 100 basis point change in interest rates on this subordinated debt would result in 132000 change in pretax earnings on an annual basis assuming the exchange rate at december 31 2007 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we are exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar as a result of our 66 economic interest and our 49 common equity interest in cfl at the present time we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to cfl 

we are also exposed to changes in the value of the swiss franc as we have chf 150 million of subordinated debt due from keytrade as of december 31 2007 a 010 change in the us dollar value of the chf would result in a 15 million change in pretax earnings on an annual basis 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to the nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer sales not made under the forward pricing program are sensitive to changes in nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia urea and uan 28 by approximately 33 22 and 12 respectively 

we use natural gas in the manufacture of our nitrogen fertilizer products because natural gas prices are volatile our natural gas acquisition policy includes the objective of providing protection against significant adverse natural gas price movements we manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering periods not exceeding three years the derivative instruments currently used are swaps these contracts reference primarily nymex futures contract prices which represent fair value at any given time the related contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods as of december 31 2007 we had hedged approximately 391 million mmbtus of natural gas all of which related to sales that had been contracted to be sold through our forward pricing program as of december 31 2007 an overall 100 per mmbtu change in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change the pretax unrealized marktomarket gainloss on these derivative positions by 391 million we also establish derivative 

cf industries holdings inc 

positions in natural gas that are unrelated to forward pricing program contracts if we consider it appropriate to do so 

through the third quarter of 2005 we applied cash flow hedge accounting as defined in sfas no 133— accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  wherein we recorded the derivatives as assets and liabilities at their fair value on the balance sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income loss the gain or loss of an effective cash flow hedge was deferred in other comprehensive income loss until the cost of the hedged gas was recognized in cost of sales ineffective hedge gains and losses were recorded directly in cost of sales 

instability in the natural gas market during the last half of 2005 and our resulting decision to supply fpp orders from sources other than production reduced our ability to predict future natural gas requirements consequently we ceased classifying derivatives as cash flow hedges beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result while the derivatives are still carried at their fair value on the balance sheet unrealized gains or losses related to the derivatives are recognized in operations as they occur 

we purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of dap and map we attempt to include any price fluctuations related to these raw materials in our selling prices of finished products but there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered we enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices a 10 per related ton change in the cost of a ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change dap production cost by 210 per ton and 380 per ton respectively we also purchase ammonia urea and uan to augment or replace production at our facilities

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

through the end of 2002 we operated as a traditional supply cooperative our focus was on providing our preipo owners with an assured supply of fertilizer typically over 80 of our annual sales volume was to our preipo owners though important financial performance was subordinate to our mandated supply objective 

in 2002 we reassessed our corporate mission and adopted a new business model that established financial performance rather than assured supply to our preipo owners as our principal objective a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace under the new business model we began to pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on financial performance one result of this approach was a substantial shift in our customer mix by 2006 our sales to customers other than our preipo owners and western cooperative fertilizers limited westco our joint venture partner in cfl reached approximately 46 of our total sales volume for the year which was more than double the comparable percentage for 2002 

in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering of common stock and listing on the new york stock exchange we sold 47437500 shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 7154 million we did not retain any of the proceeds from the ipo in connection with the ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative in the reorganization transaction our preipo owners’ equity interests in cf industries inc now our whollyowned subsidiary were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and 7562499 shares of our common stock 

operating segments 

our business is divided into two operating segments the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business 

nitrogen fertilizer business 

we are one of the leading nitrogen fertilizer producers in north america our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia urea and uan our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the table below the sales shown do not reflect amounts used internally in the manufacture of other products for example in 2006 we used about 17 million tons of ammonia in the production of urea and uan 

 

1   other nitrogen fertilizer products include aqua ammonia

cf industries holdings inc 

gross margin for the nitrogen fertilizer business was 985 million 1729 million and 1938 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

total assets for the nitrogen fertilizer business were 4939 million 5525 million and 5578 million as of december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

we operate worldscale nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in donaldsonville louisiana and medicine hat alberta canada we own the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex and have a 66 economic interest in cfl a canadian joint venture that owns the medicine hat nitrogen fertilizer complex the combined production capacity of these two facilities represents approximately 20 of north american ammonia capacity 32 of north american dry urea capacity and 18 of north american uan capacity in 2006 

the following table summarizes our nitrogen fertilizer production volume for the last three years at our facilities in donaldsonville louisiana and medicine hat alberta 

 

1   gross ammonia production including amounts subsequently upgraded onsite into urea andor uan

2   includes total production of the donaldsonville and medicine hat facilities including the 34 interest of westco our joint venture partner in canadian fertilizers limited

donaldsonville nitrogen complex 

the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex is the largest nitrogen fertilizer production facility in north america it has four worldscale ammonia plants four urea plants and two uan plants it has the capacity to produce annually approximately 23 million tons of ammonia most of which is typically upgraded into urea and uan 26 million tons of liquid urea including amounts upgraded into uan and 27 million tons of uan measured on a 28 nitrogen content basis with uan operating at capacity approximately 17 million tons of granular urea can be produced granular urea production can be increased to 2 million tons per year if uan production is reduced 

we believe that this facility is the most versatile nitrogen fertilizer production complex in north america with multiple production units for each product the complex has considerable flexibility to adjust its product mix donaldsonville is located near the mouth of the mississippi river and has three docks that can be used simultaneously under most river conditions in addition donaldsonville is located on the union pacific railroad and the valero ammonia pipeline providing us with flexible and competitively priced transportation to our inmarket nitrogen fertilizer terminals and warehouses by rail and pipeline as well as by barge the facility is capable of docking and unloading into its storage system oceangoing ship loads of ammonia and uan providing us with direct access to global suppliers the complex has onsite storage for 70000 tons of ammonia 135000 tons of uan measured on a 28 nitrogen content basis and 83000 tons of granular urea providing us with flexibility to handle temporary disruptions to shipping activities without impacting production and also flexibility to purchase and store liquid product for resale 

cf industries holdings inc 

medicine hat nitrogen complex 

medicine hat is the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in canada it has two worldscale ammonia plants that have a combined gross annual production capacity of approximately 13 million tons and a worldscale urea plant that has a gross annual production capacity of 810000 tons the complex has onsite storage for 60000 tons of ammonia and 70000 tons of urea providing flexibility to handle temporary disruptions of outbound shipments 

the medicine hat facility is owned by cfl we own 49 of the voting common stock of cfl and 66 of cfl’s nonvoting preferred stock westco owns 34 of the voting common stock and nonvoting preferred stock of cfl the remaining 17 of the voting common stock of cfl is owned by growmark inc growmark and la coop fédérée we designate four members of cfl’s ninemember board of directors westco designates 3 members and growmark and la coop fédérée each designate one member cfl is included in our consolidated financial statements 

we operate the medicine hat facility and purchase approximately 66 of the facility’s ammonia and urea production pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either cf industries inc or cfl upon a twelvemonth notice westco has the right but not the obligation to purchase the remaining 34 of the facility’s ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement to the extent that westco does not purchase its 34 of the facility’s production we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts since 1995 however westco has purchased at least 34 of the facility’s production each year

natural gas is the principal raw material as well as the primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at both the donaldsonville and the medicine hat facilities in 2006 our natural gas purchases accounted for approximately 54 of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers and a substantially higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization donaldsonville is located in close proximity to the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america known as the henry hub medicine hat is located in close proximity to the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in canada known as aeco 

we use a combination of spot and term purchases of varied duration from a variety of suppliers to maintain a reliable competitivelypriced natural gas supply in addition we use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices 

in 2006 the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex consumed approximately 73 million mmbtus of natural gas the facility has access to five natural gas pipelines which are owned by three companies and obtains gas from several suppliers in 2006 the largest individual supplier provided approximately 40 of

the donaldsonville facility’s total gas requirement the medicine hat complex consumed approximately 41 million mmbtus of natural gas in 2006 the facility has access to two natural gas pipelines and obtains gas from numerous suppliers the largest of which supplied approximately 46 of gas consumption in 2006 

nitrogen fertilizer distribution 

the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex which is located on the mississippi river includes a deepwater docking facility access to an ammonia shipping pipeline and truck and railroad loading capabilities we ship our share of ammonia and urea produced at the medicine hat nitrogen fertilizer complex by truck and rail to customers in the united states and canada and to our storage facilities in the northern united states 

ammonia urea and uan from donaldsonville can be loaded into river barges and oceangoing vessels for direct shipment to domestic customers transport to storage facilities or export we own six ammonia river barges with a total capacity of approximately 16400 tons we contract on a dedicated basis for tug services and the operation of these barges as of december 31 2006 we had 16 uan river barges contracted on a dedicated basis with a total capacity of approximately 48000 tons additional ammonia and uan barge capacity is contracted for as needed river transportation for urea is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators 

the donaldsonville facility is connected to the valero ammonia pipeline this 2000mile long ammonia pipeline is used by several nitrogen producers to transport ammonia to over 20 terminals and shipping points located in the midwestern us cornbelt we are a major customer of this ammonia pipeline in 2006 approximately 55 of our ammonia shipments from our donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex were transported via the ammonia pipeline 

we also transport substantial volumes of urea and uan from the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex and ammonia and urea from the medicine hat nitrogen fertilizer complex by rail in addition to rail cars provided by the rail carriers as of december 31 2006 we had leases for approximately 500 ammonia tank cars 1000 uan tank cars and 600 dry product hopper cars 

phosphate fertilizer business 

we are a major manufacturer of phosphate fertilizer products our main phosphate fertilizer products are dap and map our historical sales of phosphate fertilizer products are shown in the table below 

 

  

gross margin for the phosphate fertilizer business was 487 million 363 million and 223 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

total assets for the phosphate fertilizer business were 4269 million 4089 million and 4288 million as of december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

our phosphate fertilizer manufacturing operations are located in central florida and consist of a phosphate fertilizer chemical complex in plant city and a phosphate rock mine a beneficiation plant and phosphate rock reserves in hardee county we own each of these facilities and properties

hardee county phosphate rock mine 

in 1975 we purchased 20000 acres of land in hardee county florida that was originally estimated to contain in excess of 100 million tons of recoverable rock reserves between 1978 and mid1993 we operated a onemillionton per year phosphate rock mine on a 5000acre portion of these reserves 

in 1992 we initiated a project to expand and relocate mining operations to the remaining 15000acre area of the reserve property the new phosphate rock mine began operations in late 1995 at a cost of 135 million in 1997 we added approximately 20 million tons to our reserve base through an exchange with a neighboring rock producer in 1999 we acquired 1400 acres containing an estimated 8 million tons of rock reserves

plant city phosphate complex 

our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in north america at one million tons per year its phosphoric acid capacity represents approximately 9 of the total us capacity all of plant city’s phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates dap and map representing approximately 12 of us capacity for ammonium phosphate fertilizer products in 2006 the combination of the plant city phosphate fertilizer complex and the hardee mine gives us one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in north america with the only purchased raw materials being sulfur and ammonia 

bartow phosphate complex 

we own a complex in bartow florida that was idled in 1983 except for operation of one sulfuric acid plant in 199699 and minor phosphate production runs in 1985 and 198889 in 2000 we decided to discontinue maintenance on the phosphate producing portions of the complex through 2003 we used the plant’s warehouse to provide us with additional storage and shipping capacity in 2004 we discontinued use of the facility as a warehousing operation our current objective is to minimize the ongoing costs related to the facility including our obligations with respect to closing the phosphogypsum stack and disposing of the site’s process water 

phosphate raw materials 

phosphate rock supply   phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers approximately 35 tons of phosphate rock are needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5  the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex consumes in excess of three million tons of rock annually as of december 31 2006 our rock mine had approximately 16 years of fullypermitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our hardee property where we can mine the expanded area has an estimated 33 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves we estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately nine additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area

sulfur supply   sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid approximately threequarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of p 2 o 5 our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 770000 long tons of sulfur annually when operating at capacity we obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration in 2006 cf martin sulphur our largest molten sulfur supplier since 2001 supplied approximately 61 of the molten sulfur used at plant city cf martin sulphur was created in november 2000 as a joint venture between martin resource management and certain of its affiliates martin and us on july 15 2005 we sold our interest in cf martin sulphur to martin concurrent with the sale we entered into a multiyear sulfur supply contract with cf martin sulphur

ammonia supply   in addition to its 46 phosphate nutrient content dap has a nitrogen content of 18 map has a nitrogen content of 11 ammonia is the primary source of nitrogen in dap and map operating at capacity our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex consumes approximately 400000 tons of ammonia annually

the ammonia used at our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia storage facility located in tampa florida this facility acquired in 1992 consists of a 38000ton ammonia storage tank access to a deepwater dock that is capable of discharging oceangoing vessels and rail and truckloading facilities in addition to supplying our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex our tampa ammonia distribution system has the capacity to support ammonia sales to other customers sales of

ammonia from our tampa terminal are reported in our nitrogen business segment the ammonia supply for tampa is purchased from offshore sources providing us with access to the broad international ammonia market 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 the mosaic company and us agrichemicals completed the early termination of mosaic’s existing phosphate rock supply agreement with us agrichemicals and us agrichemicals ceased phosphate operations at its florida phosphate facilities upon exhaustion of its remaining raw materials inventories in 2005 and 2004 most of the ammonia sales from our tampa terminal were to us agrichemicals in 2005 we realized approximately 442 million of sales revenue on sales volumes of approximately 168000 tons of ammonia to us agrichemicals 

phosphate distribution 

we operate a phosphate warehouse located at a deepwater port facility in tampa florida a majority of the phosphate fertilizer produced at plant city is shipped by truck or rail to our tampa warehouse where it is loaded onto vessels for sale in the export market or for transport across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river in 2006 our tampa warehouse handled approximately 13 million tons of phosphate fertilizers or about 65 of our production for that year the remainder of our phosphate fertilizer production is transported by truck or rail directly to customers or to inmarket storage facilities 

phosphate fertilizer shipped across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river is transferred into river barges near new orleans phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is transported to our storage facilities or sold and delivered directly to customers river transportation is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators 

storage facilities and other properties 

we currently own or rent space at 48 inmarket storage terminals and warehouses located in a 16state region including storage at our production facilities and at the tampa warehouse and ammonia terminal we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately two million tons of fertilizer 

our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table 

 

1   capacity is expressed as the equivalent volume of uan measured on a 28 nitrogen content basis

2   our dry products include urea dap and map

3   our lease agreements are typically for periods of one to three years

in addition to these facilities we also own our corporate headquarters which is currently located in long grove illinois in the first quarter of 2007 we expect to relocate our corporate headquarters to a leased office facility located in deerfield illinois we are currently seeking a buyer for our facility in long grove illinois

competition 

our markets are intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers 

in the nitrogen fertilizer business our primary north americanbased competitors are agrium koch nitrogen and terra industries there is also significant competition from product sourced from regions of the world with low natural gas costs because urea is a widelytraded fertilizer product and there are limited barriers to entry competition from foreignsourced product is particularly acute with respect to urea 

cf industries holdings inc 

in the phosphate fertilizer business our primary north americanbased competitors are agrium mosaic potash corp and simplot historically imports have not been a factor as the united states is a large net exporter of phosphate fertilizers 

seasonality 

the sales patterns of all five of our major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

financial information about foreign and domestic sales and operations 

the amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying value of our foreign and domestic assets are set forth in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements note 29—segment disclosures 

environment health and safety 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes violations can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns in addition environmental health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment 

we have received notices from time to time from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws we are currently involved in remediation activities at certain of our current and former facilities we are also participating in the cleanup of thirdparty sites at which we have disposed of wastes in april 2002 we were asked by the current owner of a former phosphate mine and manufacturing facility that we operated in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho to contribute to a remediation of this property we declined to participate in the cleanup it is our understanding that the current owner is undertaking an investigation of the environmental conditions at the site we do not know if a final remedy has been identified by the current owner and approved by the state we anticipate that the current owner may bring a lawsuit against us seeking contribution for the cleanup costs although we do not have sufficient information to determine when such a suit may be brought we are not able to estimate at this time our potential liability with respect to the remediation of this property based on currently available information we do not expect that any remedial or financial obligations we may be subject to involving this or other sites will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

cf industries holdings inc 

in december 2004 and january 2005 the united states environmental protection agency epa inspected our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex to evaluate the facility’s compliance with rcra the federal statute that governs the generation transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous wastes by letter dated september 27 2005 epa region iv issued to the company a notice of violation nov and compliance evaluation inspection report the nov and compliance evaluation inspection report alleged a number of violations of rcra including violations relating to recordkeeping the failure to properly make hazardous waste determinations as required by rcra and alleged treatment of sulfuric acid waste without a permit the most significant allegation in the nov is that the plant city facility’s reuse of phosphoric acid process water which is otherwise exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste in the production of ammoniated phosphate fertilizer and the return of this process water to the facility’s process water recirculating system has resulted in the disposal of hazardous waste into the system without a permit the compliance evaluation inspection report indicates that as a result the entire process water system including all pipes cooling ponds and gypsum stacks could be regulated as hazardous waste management units under rcra if the epa’s position is eventually upheld the company could incur material expenditures in order to modify its practices or it may be required to comply with regulations applicable to hazardous waste treatment storage or disposal facilities if the company is required to comply with such obligations it could incur material capital and operating expenditures or may be required to cease operation of the water recirculating system that does not meet rcra standards this would cause a significant disruption of the operations of the plant city facility the epa has referred the matter to the department of justice for enforcement for additional information see item 3 legal proceedings 

we expect continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future investments for environmental controls at ongoing operations our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2006 were approximately 27 million we estimate that we will spend between 5 million and 8 million annually in 2007 and 2008 for environmental health and safety capital expenditures environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we may be required to incur additional expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we hold numerous environmental and mining permits authorizing operations at our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals 

as of december 31 2006 the area permitted for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 55 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current production rates for approximately 16 years we have secured the necessary permits to mine these reserves from the florida department of environmental protection and the us army corps of engineers we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated additional 33 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately nine additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area the estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective of the anticipated permittable mining areas based on recent similar permitting efforts in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of 

cf industries holdings inc 

our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

likewise our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2014 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits we have secured the local development authorization to increase the capacity of this stack system based on this authorization estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately eight years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in certain cases as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure the government that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities in march 2006 we established an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection as a means of taking advantage of a safe harbor provision in a 2005 amendment to florida’s regulations pertaining to financial assurance requirements for the closure of phosphogypsum stacks for additional information on the cash deposit arrangement see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements note 9—asset retirement obligations 

several of our permits including our mining permit at the hardee phosphate complex require us to reclaim any property disturbed by our operations at our hardee property we currently mine approximately 300 to 400 acres of land each year all of which must be reclaimed the costs to reclaim this land vary based on the type of land involved and range from 3000 to 20000 an acre with an average of 6000 an acre for additional information on our hardee asset retirement obligations see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements note 9—asset retirement obligations 

our phosphate operations in florida are subject to regulations governing the closure and longterm maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems in accordance with those regulations we closed the old phosphogypsum stack system at the plant city phosphate fertilizer complex and are in the process of closing the phosphogypsum stack system at the bartow phosphate complex 

at our bartow phosphate complex we estimate that we will spend approximately 45 million between 2007 and 2008 and another 103 million between 2016 and 2023 to complete closure of the phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond water treating expenditures at bartow are expected to require about 24 million in 2007 29 million in 2008 through 2013 and another 95 million in 2014 through 2056 postclosure longterm care expenditures at bartow are estimated to total 733 million for a sixtyseven year period commencing in 2007 to close the phosphogypsum stack currently in use at the plant city phosphate complex we estimate that we will spend approximately 101 million in 2023 and 2024 approximately 312 million during the years 2031 through 2037 and another 479 million in 2087 to close the cooling pond water treating expenditures at plant city are expected to approximate 59 million in 2018 666 million in 2033 through 2037 and roughly 1034 million thereafter through 2087 postclosure longterm care expenditures at plant city are estimated to total 1124 million for a fifty year period commencing in 2038 these amounts are in nominal dollars using an assumed inflation rate of 3 for additional information on our asset retirement obligations see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements note 9—asset retirement obligations

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business is subject to a number of risks if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is dependent on the price of natural gas in north america which is both expensive and highly volatile 

natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea and uan because all of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses expenditures on natural gas comprised approximately 54 of the total cost of our nitrogen fertilizer sales in 2006 and a substantially higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization 

the market price for natural gas in north america is significantly higher than the price of natural gas in other major fertilizerproducing regions for example during 2006 natural gas prices in the united states measured at the henry hub near our donaldsonville louisiana facility averaged approximately 674 per mmbtu and in canada measured at aeco near our joint venture’s medicine hat alberta facility averaged approximately 576 per mmbtu in comparison during 2006 natural gas prices paid by fertilizer producers are estimated to have been approximately 125 per mmbtu in russia and approximately 265 per mmbtu in the republic of trinidad and tobago many of our competitors benefit from access to lowerpriced natural gas through manufacturing facilities or interests in manufacturing facilities located in these regions or other regions with abundant supplies of natural gas 

the price of natural gas in north america is also highly volatile during 2006 the median daily price at henry hub ranged from a low of 367 per mmbtu on october 2 2006 to a high of 992 per mmbtu on january 4 2006 during 2005 the median daily price at henry hub ranged from a low of 553 per mmbtu on january 4 2005 to a high of 1540 per mmbtu on december 14 2005 the volatility of the price of natural gas in north america compounds our competitive disadvantage to some of our competitors who in addition to having access to lowerpriced natural gas may also benefit from fixedprice natural gas contracts 

as a result of global competition in the fertilizer industry we may not be able to pass along to our customers in the form of higher product prices the higher operating costs we incur due to our dependence on north american natural gas for example due to the high cost of natural gas during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 we curtailed production of fertilizers at our donaldsonville complex because market prices of nitrogen fertilizer were below our cost of production unless differences between the prices for natural gas in north america and other fertilizerproducing regions are reduced or we are able to reduce our dependence on north american natural gas the relatively expensive and highly volatile cost of natural gas in north america could make it difficult for us to compete against producers from other parts of the world 

our business is cyclical which results in periods of industry oversupply during which our results of operations tend to be negatively impacted 

historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by population growth changes in dietary habits nonfood 

cf industries holdings inc 

usage of crops and planted acreage and application rates among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs government policies and global trade 

periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in new plant investment and increased production causing supply to exceed demand and prices and capacity utilization to decline in particular new ammonia and urea capacity is expected to be added abroad in lowcost regions future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to alleviate any existing or future conditions of excess industry capacity 

during periods of industry oversupply our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in reduced profit margins lower production of our products and possible plant closures 

our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers 

we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which makes them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities 

recent consolidation in the fertilizer industry has increased the resources of several of our competitors and we expect consolidation among fertilizer producers to continue in light of this industry consolidation our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships in the future we may not be able to find suitable assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities we may not be able to acquire desired assets or enter into desired joint ventures or partnerships on economically acceptable terms our inability to compete successfully could result in the loss of customers which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

china is the world’s largest producer and consumer of fertilizers and has been and is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may face increased competition from russian and ukrainian urea which is currently subject to antidumping duty orders that impose significant duties on urea imported into the united states from these two countries the antidumping orders have been in place since 1987 and there has been almost no urea imported into the united states from russia or ukraine since that time russia and ukraine currently have considerable capacity to produce urea and are the world’s largest urea exporters producers in both countries benefit from natural gas prices that are determined by their governments and which are well below the commercial value of natural gas in other regions of the world encouraging urea production and potential export activity following a review by the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission the antidumping orders were extended for an additional fiveyear period in november 2005 the decision to extend the orders has been appealed by the russian producers for a number of reasons including available capacity the attractiveness of the us market and barriers to urea imports in other key consuming markets we expect that if the decision to extend the orders is reversed 

cf industries holdings inc 

imports of russian and ukrainian urea into the united states are likely to increase significantly causing our sales and margins to suffer 

any decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products 

conditions in the us agricultural industry can significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices the domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products 

state and federal governmental policies including farm and ethanol subsidies and commodity support programs may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications in addition several states are currently considering limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment 

we have a history of losses and may incur losses in the future which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we incurred net losses in six out of the last eight years 1999 through 2003 and 2005 in future periods we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a consistent quarterly or annual basis failure to maintain consistent profitability may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products 

weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers 

our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages 

the fertilizer business is seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

if seasonal demand exceeds our projections our customers may acquire products from our competitors and our profitability will be negatively impacted if seasonal demand is less than we expect we will be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively impacted by any related storage costs andor liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and

product shortages are particularly acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the highly volatile cost of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers 

our customer base is concentrated with certain large customers accounting for a substantial portion of our sales 

during 2006 three customers agriliance llc a 5050 joint venture between land o’lakes inc and chs inc growmark inc and conagra international fertilizer company made combined fertilizer purchases of approximately 9440 million from us representing approximately 48 of our total net sales because we depend on these customers for a significant portion of our sales we may have less flexibility than some of our competitors to diversify our customer base and seek more profitable direct sales to customers of our significant customers any substantial change in purchasing decisions by any or all of these customers whether due to actions by our competitors our actions in expanding the direct sale of fertilizers to the customers of our significant customers or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a reduction in the use of the forward pricing program by our customers or an increase in the use of product purchases to support the program could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our operating results liquidity and financial condition 

in mid2003 we instituted a forward pricing program through our forward pricing program we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we effectively fix the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our supply cost as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products under our forward pricing program often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment under our forward pricing program customers generally pay a significant portion of the contract’s sales value in advance of shipment thereby significantly increasing our liquidity any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with the forward pricing program are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as of december 31 2006 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders under this program equaled approximately 32 of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

we believe the forward pricing program is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices for example in the fourth quarter of 2005 a period during which prices for nitrogen fertilizer products reached record high levels our orders under the forward pricing program declined significantly as our customers and their customers preferred to defer purchases of fertilizer products rather than commit to purchasing products at such high prices sales under the forward pricing program were lower during 2006 a period of relatively high fertilizer prices compared to 2005 with forward sales of nitrogen fertilizer products declining from approximately 70 of our nitrogen fertilizer volume during 2005 to approximately 44 in 2006 

the forward pricing program is also less effective at reducing our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins in circumstances where we intend to purchase the fertilizer product from third parties for resale rather than manufacture the product at one of our facilities for example due to the high cost of natural gas in north america during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 we decided to curtail production at our facilities and increase our purchases of fertilizer products originating from offshore 

cf industries holdings inc 

lower cost producers for resale to our customers because it is generally not feasible to purchase fertilizer products from these third parties on a forward basis or match purchased quantities with specific order quantities we may not be able to fix our profit margins effectively on fertilizer products that we buy for resale under our forward pricing program one method we use to reduce our margin exposure on sales of purchased products under our forward pricing program is to purchase the required fertilizer products in advance of the specified delivery date in such circumstances however we may be required to buy and store the product sooner and in greater quantities than if produced thereby reducing the liquidity benefits otherwise associated with the forward pricing program 

any significant increase in our purchases of fertilizer products for resale to our customers or any reduction in the use of the forward pricing program by our customers due to changing conditions in the fertilizer market or otherwise could increase our exposure to fluctuating profit margins and materially adversely affect our operating results liquidity and financial condition 

our operations involve significant risks and hazards against which we may not be fully insured 

our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and they may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities for example over the course of the past few years we have been involved in numerous property damage and personal injury lawsuits arising out of a hydrogen explosion at our donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex in 2000 in which three people died and several others were injured we were also involved in personal injury lawsuits arising out of a train derailment near minot north dakota in 2002 that ruptured five tank cars causing the formation of an ammonia cloud over the area in which one person died and numerous others were injured 

our exposure to these types of risks is increased because of our reliance on a limited number of key facilities our nitrogen fertilizer operations are dependent on our nitrogen fertilizer complex in donaldsonville louisiana and our joint venture’s nitrogen fertilizer complex in medicine hat alberta our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on our phosphate mine and associated beneficiation plant in hardee county florida our phosphate fertilizer complex in plant city florida and our ammonia terminal in tampa florida any suspension of operations at any of these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition all of these facilities other than the complex in medicine hat are located in regions of the united states that experience a relatively high level of hurricane activity such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas and sulfur in the gulf region 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we are subject to various selfretentions and deductibles under these insurance policies as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage

we rely on third party providers of transportation services and equipment which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations 

we rely on railroad trucking pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars from rail car owners in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including extreme weather conditions work stoppages delays spills derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards 

these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to terrorism the potential use of fertilizers as explosives or accidents local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of our raw materials or finished products in addition new regulations could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products 

if we are delayed or unable to ship our finished products or obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies’ failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our sales revenues andor cost of operations could be adversely affected 

expansion of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences and may be hindered by the significant resources that would be required for any such expansion 

in the future we may seek to expand our business by investing in new or existing facilities making acquisitions or entering into partnerships and joint ventures acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or investments may require significant managerial attention which may be diverted from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses 

international acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures or the international expansion of our business could involve additional risks and uncertainties including 

·   difficulties and costs of complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations

·   unexpected changes in regulatory environments

·   political and economic instability including the possibility for civil unrest

·   nationalization of properties by foreign governments

·   tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements

·   the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions and

·   the impact of exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and foreign currencies in the countries where we operate

furthermore any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of additional risks including 

·   problems with effective integration of operations

·   the inability to maintain key preacquisition business relationships

cf industries holdings inc 

·   loss of key personnel of the acquired business or facility

·   exposure to unanticipated liabilities and

·   difficulties in realizing efficiencies synergies and cost savings

these risks of unanticipated adverse consequences from any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion we also face increased exposure to risks related to acquisitions and international operations because our experience with acquisitions and international operations is limited as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other investments 

we may not have access to the funding required for the expansion of our business or such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms we may finance the expansion of our business with additional indebtedness andor by issuing additional equity securities we could face financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness such as reducing our liquidity and access to financial markets and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service such indebtedness or associated with issuing additional equity securities such as dilution of ownership and earnings 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures 

we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the united states and canada including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases these laws include the clean air act the clean water act rcra cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes 

as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment 

violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations additionally future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or more vigorous enforcement of current laws and regulations whether caused by violations of environmental and health and safety laws by us or other chemical fertilizer companies or otherwise may require us to make substantial expenditures and our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our operations are dependent on numerous required permits and approvals from governmental authorities 

we hold numerous environmental mining and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion of our operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in certain cases as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure the government that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation at our facilities in march 2006 we established an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection as a means of taking advantage of a safe harbor provision in a 2005 amendment to florida’s regulations pertaining to financial assurance requirements for the closure of phosphogypsum stacks additionally florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities the demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds letters of credit insurance policies or similar instruments it is possible that we will not be able to comply with either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2006 the area permitted by local state and federal authorities for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 55 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current operating rates for approximately 16 years we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated 33 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately nine additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

likewise our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2014 at current operating rates and is subject to regular renewals of our operating permits we have secured the local development authorization to increase the capacity of this stack system based on this authorization estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately eight years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

acts of terrorism could negatively affect our business 

like other companies with major industrial facilities our plants and ancillary facilities may be targets of terrorist activities many of these plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other items that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations impacting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues andor reduced profit margins 

our operations are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and any delay or interruption in the delivery of these raw materials may adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas ammonia and sulfur as raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase these raw materials from thirdparty suppliers these products are transported by barge truck rail or pipeline to our facilities by thirdparty transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw materials including those caused by capacity constraints explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving pipelines deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime or labor difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the loss of key members of our management and professional staff may adversely affect our business 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our senior management and professional staff the loss of one or more key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally if we are unable to find hire and retain needed key personnel in the future our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

environmental 

in december 2004 and january 2005 the united states environmental protection agency epa inspected our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex to evaluate the facility’s compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the federal statute that governs the generation transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous wastes this inspection was undertaken as a part of a broad enforcement initiative commenced by the epa to evaluate whether mineral processing and mining facilities including in particular all wet process phosphoric acid production facilities are in compliance with rcra and the extent to which such facilities’ waste management practices have impacted the environment 

by letter dated september 27 2005 epa region 4 issued to the company a notice of violation nov and compliance evaluation inspection report the nov and compliance evaluation inspection report alleged a number of violations of rcra including violations relating to recordkeeping the failure to properly make hazardous waste determinations as required by rcra and alleged treatment of sulfuric acid waste without a permit the most significant allegation in the nov is that the plant city facility’s reuse of phosphoric acid process water which is otherwise exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste in the production of ammoniated phosphate fertilizer and the return of this process water to the facility’s process water recirculating system have resulted in the disposal of hazardous waste into the system without a permit the compliance evaluation inspection report indicates that as a result the entire process water system including all pipes ditches cooling ponds and gypsum stacks could be regulated as hazardous waste management units under rcra 

several of our competitors have received novs making this same allegation this particular recycling of process water is common in the industry and the company believes was authorized by the epa in 1990 the company also believes that this allegation is inconsistent with recent case law governing the scope of the epa’s regulatory authority under rcra if the epa’s position is eventually upheld the company could incur material expenditures in order to modify its practices or it may be required to comply with regulations applicable to hazardous waste treatment storage or disposal facilities if the company is required to comply with such obligations it could incur material capital and operating expenditures or may 

cf industries holdings inc 

be required to cease operation of the water recirculating system if it is determined that it does not meet rcra standards this would cause a significant disruption of the operations of the plant city facility 

the nov indicated that the company is liable for penalties up to the statutory maximum for example the statutory maximum per day of noncompliance for each violation that occurred after march 15 2004 is 32500 per day although penalties of this magnitude are rarely if ever imposed the company is at risk of incurring substantial civil penalties with respect to these allegations the epa has referred this matter to the united states department of justice doj for enforcement the company has entered into discussions with the doj that have included not only the issues identified in the nov but other operational practices of the company and its competitors the company does not know if this matter will be resolved prior to the commencement of litigation by the united states 

in connection with the rcra enforcement initiative the epa collected samples of soil groundwater and various waste streams at the plant city facility the analysis of the split samples collected by the company during the epa’s inspection did not identify hazardous waste disposal issues impacting the site the epa’s sampling results appear to be consistent with the company’s results pursuant to a 1992 consent order with the state of florida the company captures and reuses groundwater that has been impacted as a result of the former operation of an unlined gypsum stack at the site although the company believes that it has evaluated and is remediating the impacts resulting from its historic activities the doj and the epa have indicated that they will be seeking additional environmental investigation at the facilities subject to the enforcement initiative including plant city in addition we understand that the epa may decide to inspect our bartow florida property where we formerly manufactured phosphoric acid the epa has requested and the company has provided copies of existing monitoring data for this facility depending on the conclusions that the epa reaches after reviewing this data the epa may require that an investigation of environmental conditions be undertaken at the bartow facility

overview 

our company 

we are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products in north america our operations are organized into two business segments the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business our principal products in the nitrogen fertilizer business are ammonia urea and urea ammonium nitrate solution or uan our principal products in the phosphate fertilizer business are diammonium phosphate or dap and monoammonium phosphate or map for the twelve months ended june 30 2005 the most recent period for which such information is available we supplied approximately 24 of the nitrogen and approximately 12 of the phosphate used in agricultural fertilizer applications in the united states our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern us grainproducing states 

our principal assets include 

·   the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in north america donaldsonville louisiana

·   a 66 economic interest in the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in canada which we operate in medicine hat alberta through canadian fertilizers limited or cfl a consolidated variable interest entity

·   one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer complexes in the united states plant city florida

·   the mostrecently constructed phosphate rock mine and associated beneficiation plant in the united states hardee county florida and

·   an extensive system of terminals warehouses and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern united states

company history 

we were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power during the 1960s we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities during the 1970s and again during the 1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades 

through the end of 2002 we operated as a traditional supply cooperative our focus was on providing our preipo owners with an assured supply of fertilizer typically over 80 of our annual sales volume was to our preipo owners though important financial performance was subordinate to our mandated supply objective 

cf industries holdings inc 

in 2002 we reassessed our corporate mission and adopted a new business model that established financial performance rather than assured supply to our preipo owners as our principal objective a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace under the new business model we began to pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on financial performance one result of this approach was a substantial shift in our customer mix by 2006 our sales to customers other than our preipo owners and western cooperative fertilizers limited westco our joint venture partner in cfl reached approximately 46 of our total sales volume for the year which was more than double the comparable percentage for 2002 

cf holdings was formed as a delaware corporation in april 2005 to hold the existing businesses of cf industries inc in august of 2005 we completed our initial public offering of common stock 

executive summary 

·   we reported net earnings of 333 million in 2006 compared to a net loss of 390 million in 2005 our results for 2006 included a net 307 million pretax marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives and a pretax charge of 216 million for adjustments to our asset retirement obligations aros and demolition costs primarily related to our closed bartow florida complex the net loss of 390 million in 2005 included a 999 million charge to the income tax provision to record a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to cf industries inc’s net operating loss carryforwards generated during preipo operations a 283 million loss on the extinguishment of debt a net 93 million pretax marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives and a 128 million pretax charge to aros primarily related to our bartow florida complex

·   our gross margin decreased 620 million to 1472 million in 2006 compared to 2092 million in 2005 the decline in gross margin resulted primarily from unfavorable variances related to natural gas costs and higher phosphate raw material costs partially offset by higher average selling prices for ammonia as well as higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices

·   our net sales were 19 billion for both 2006 and 2005 higher average selling prices for ammonia and phosphate fertilizers in 2006 were offset by lower nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes our total sales volume of 84 million tons for 2006 approximated the volume of tons sold in 2005

·   we paid cash dividends of 44 million in 2006

the following significant items affected the comparability of our reported results for 2006 and our financial position as of december 31 2006 

on august 16 2005 we completed our ipo of common stock we sold 47437500 shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 7154 million we did not retain any of the proceeds from our ipo in connection with our ipo we consummated a reorganization transaction in which cf industries inc ceased to be a cooperative and became our whollyowned subsidiary in the reorganization transaction all of the equity interests in cf industries inc were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the ipo and 7562499 shares of our common stock 

in connection with our ipo we also recorded a charge to the income tax provision of 999 million to reduce to zero what remained of the gross deferred tax asset related to cf industries inc’s net operating loss carryforwards as of august 16 2005 cf industries inc’s last day as a cooperative those net operating loss carryforwards were generated from business conducted with cf industries inc’s preipo owners while cf industries inc was a cooperative in connection with our ipo we entered into an nol agreement with the preipo owners of cf industries inc which provides that in the event that it is finally determined by the applicable taxing jurisdictions that cf industries inc’s preipo nols can be utilized 

cf industries holdings inc 

we will pay the preipo owners an amount equal to the federal and state income taxes saved by the utilization of the preipo nols see notes 12 and 30 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of the nol agreement 

in august of 2005 we replaced our 140 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a 250 million senior secured revolving credit facility 

in august of 2005 we repaid in full 2356 million of our term notes plus associated prepayment penalties and accrued interest in the amount of 293 million with cash on hand and by liquidating shortterm investments prior thereto we made principal payments of 07 million and 100 million on their scheduled maturity dates 

in connection with these transactions we incurred a net 171 million charge after taxes related to the prepayment penalties associated with the repayment of our long term debt 160 million and termination of a longterm incentive plan 11 million upon completion of our ipo we also incurred a noncash charge of 11 million after taxes related to the writeoff of unamortized financing fees related to our previous senior secured revolving credit facility and long term debt 

also in connection with our ipo our board of directors adopted a plan under which we grant stockbased awards to our officers employees and nonemployee directors in both 2006 and 2005 in connection with the ipo stock—based awards were granted under this plan in the third quarter of 2005 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r— sharebased payment which requires us to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards as a result the total stockbased compensation cost recognized for 2006 and 2005 was 81 million and 37 million respectively most of the stockbased compensation cost was recorded as selling general and administrative expenses we did not have stockbased awards prior to our initial public offering see the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section later in this discussion and analysis for additional information on stockbased compensation 

hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico region during the latter portion of 2005 significantly affected the domestic fertilizer industry these hurricanes caused substantial damage to the natural gas production and distribution facilities in the region affecting the supply and price of natural gas the primary raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers by the end of the first quarter of 2006 natural gas prices had moderated returning to approximately prehurricane levels these storms also affected the availability of barges used to transport urea and dapmap on the mississippi river and adversely affected the supply of sulfur a raw material used in the production of phosphate fertilizers by causing refinery closures and transportation disruptions 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we ceased classifying natural gas derivatives as cash flow hedges as defined in sfas no 133— accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  as a result realized and unrealized gains or losses related to our derivatives are now recognized in operations as they occur cash flow hedges existing at the time we discontinued hedge accounting were dedesignated as cash flow hedges during 2006 we recognized a net 307 million pretax marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives in cost of sales compared to a net 93 million pretax marktomarket loss in 2005 despite our change in accounting treatment the execution and attendant economic consequences of our hedging activities have not changed in that derivatives are still being used to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on forward pricing program fpp sales however because of our change in accounting treatment gains or losses on natural gas hedges may not be realized in the same period as the fpp sale to which they relate we also establish natural gas derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our fpp see note 24 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of derivative financial instruments

we implemented financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 47— accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin no 47 in the fourth quarter of 2005 this interpretation of sfas no 143— accounting for asset retirement obligations requires us to recognize a liability for asset retirement obligations aros associated with our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain we identified conditional aros for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities consequently we recognized an increase in aro liabilities of 46 million and an increase in deferred tax assets of 18 million resulting in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of 28 million that decreased net earnings see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of asset retirement obligations 

key industry factors 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry our products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below 

global supply  demand 

historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buying patterns of key consuming countries such as china india or brazil often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs government policies and global trade 

natural gas prices 

natural gas is the most significant raw material required in the production of nitrogen fertilizers for example in 2006 our natural gas purchases accounted for approximately 54 of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers north american natural gas prices have increased substantially and since 1999 have become significantly more volatile in 2005 north american natural gas prices reached unprecedented levels due to the impact hurricane katrina and hurricane rita had on an already tight natural gas market by the end of the first quarter of 2006 natural gas prices moderated returning to prehurricane levels our competitive position on a worldwide basis has been negatively impacted by the higher price of north american natural gas relative to the gas prices available to fertilizer producers in other regions of the world 

farmers’ economics 

the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns and the types of crops planted fertilizer demand is expected to increase in the future in response to increased corn acreage required to support the growing ethanol industry 

cf industries holdings inc 

global trade in fertilizer 

in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters changes in currency values alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world 

imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east the former soviet union the republic of trinidad and tobago and venezuela are major exporters to north america 

the domestic phosphate fertilizer industry is tied to the global market through its position as the world’s largest exporter of dapmap historically china has been a major source of demand for the us phosphate fertilizer industry china’s reliance on imported phosphate fertilizers has decreased over the last three years as a matter of chinese government policy to achieve self sufficiency in these products however growth in demand in other international markets including latin america india and pakistan has partially offset declining imports by china 

political and social government policies 

the political and social policies of governments around the world can result in the restriction of imports the subsidization of domestic producers andor the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives 

factors affecting our results 

net sales   our net sales are derived from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors

cost of sales   our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs product purchases and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials maintenance direct labor and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to buy ammonia for use in our phosphate fertilizer business and the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs prior to final shipment to customers

in mid2003 we instituted a margin risk management approach utilizing our forward pricing program fpp which allows us to manage some of the risks created by the volatility of fertilizer prices and natural gas costs through our fpp we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost using natural gas derivative instruments in the third quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 due to the increased volatility of natural gas prices we fulfilled a significant amount of fpp orders with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases rather than with manufactured product see “—forward pricing program” as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products under our fpp often

we operate the medicine hat facility and purchase approximately 66 of the facility’s ammonia and urea production pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either us or cfl upon a twelvemonth notice westco has the right but not the obligation to purchase the remaining 34 of the facility’s ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement to the extent that westco does not purchase its 34 of the facility’s production we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts since 1995 however westco has purchased at least 34 of the facility’s production each year 

under the product purchase agreements both we and westco pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases however the product purchase agreements also provide that cfl will distribute its net earnings to us and westco annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from cfl the distributions to westco are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows as we consider these payments to be similar to dividends our product purchase agreement also requires us to advance funds to cfl in the event that cfl is unable to meet its debts as they become due the amount of each advance would be at least 66 of the deficiency and would be more in any year in which we purchased more than 66 of medicine hat’s production we and westco currently manage cfl such that each party is responsible for its share of cfl’s fixed costs and that cfl ‘s production volume meets the parties’ combined requirements the management agreement the product

impairment of investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries   impairment of investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries represents the writedown of the carrying value of our investments in our joint ventures

income taxes   upon the completion of our ipo cf industries inc ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes on the date of our ipo cf industries inc had a deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards nols generated from business conducted with cf industries inc’s preipo owners these net operating loss carryforwards totaled 250 million with expirations ranging from 2021 through 2023 the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2005 includes a charge of 999 million to establish a 100 valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to these nols the valuation allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset will be realized since cf industries inc is no longer a cooperative for federal income tax purposes

in connection with the ipo we entered into a net operating loss agreement with cf industries inc’s preipo owners nol agreement relating to the future treatment of the preipo nols under the nol agreement if it is finally determined that cf industries inc’s net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized subsequent to the ipo we will pay to cf industries inc’s preipo owners an amount equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved 

cfl operates as a cooperative for canadian income tax purposes and distributes all of its earnings as patronage dividends to its customers including cf industries inc for canadian income tax purposes cfl is permitted to deduct an amount equal to the patronage dividends it distributes to its customers provided that certain requirements are met as a result cfl records no income tax provision 

on may 13 2005 the canadian income tax act was amended to disallow the deduction of certain patronage distributions paid after march 22 2004 to nonarmslength persons in the settlement of cfl’s audit for the tax years 1997 through 2000 the canada revenue agency cra agreed that cfl has operated at armslength with cf industries with respect to the deductibility of patronage payments to cf industries for the 2004 taxation year and the company believes it has continued to operate on an armslength basis 

although cfl is not currently under audit by the canadian tax authorities cfl received a preliminary inquiry from the cra in 2005 which questioned whether cfl’s past patronage distributions had met the requirements for full deductibility under canadian income tax law while cfl believes its distributions complied with applicable law cfl could be subject to material canadian income tax liabilities if its distributions were determined to fail to meet the requirements for deductibility under canadian tax law

consolidated operating results 

in 2006 the domestic nitrogen fertilizer industry was characterized by adverse conditions early in the year remaining from the 2005 hurricane effects more moderate conditions through the fall and strength late in the year fueled by lower natural gas prices a tight international market and expectations of a strong planting season in the spring of 2007 the first half of 2006 was unfavorably impacted by high natural gas prices during the first quarter of the year and reduced demand during the spring planting season results during 2006 for our phosphate fertilizer business were affected positively by increased domestic demand and relatively balanced international supplydemand conditions our total gross margin decreased by approximately 620 million or 30 to 1472 million for 2006 compared to a gross margin of 2092 million for 2005 the net earnings of 333 million for 2006 included a pretax charge of 307 million for unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives and a pretax charge of 216 million for adjustments to aros and demolition costs primarily related to our closed bartow florida complex the net loss of 390 million for 2005 included a 999 million charge to record a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to cf industries inc’s net operating loss carryforwards generated during preipo operations a 283 million loss on the extinguishment of debt a gain of approximately 140 million associated with the early termination of certain natural gas hedge positions a pretax charge of 93 million for unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives a pretax charge of 128 million for upward adjustments to aros primarily related to our closed bartow florida complex and a 61 million tax benefit from a refund of canadian income taxes 

net sales 

our net sales were 19 billion for both 2006 and 2005 higher average selling prices for ammonia and phosphate fertilizers in 2006 were offset by lower nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes our total sales volume of 84 million tons for 2006 approximated the volume sold in 2005 nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 119000 tons or 2 to 63 million tons for 2006 compared to 64 million tons in 2005 due primarily to the cessation of production by us agrichemicals to whom we had sold ammonia previously our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales of 21 million tons for 2006 approximated the amount sold in 2005 nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer prices for 2006 averaged 2 and 6 higher respectively than the prices for similar products in 2005 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged 217 per ton for 2006 compared to 202 per ton in 2005 an increase of 7 primarily due to higher natural gas costs and higher purchased product costs 

cf industries holdings inc 

phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged 207 per ton for 2006 compared to 200 per ton in the prior year an increase of 4 mainly due to higher ammonia and sulfur costs 

during 2006 we sold approximately 30 million tons of fertilizer under our fpp representing approximately 36 of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period in 2005 we sold approximately 52 million tons of fertilizer under this program representing approximately 62 of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period the lower level of fpp sales volumes in 2006 reflected the hesitancy of our customers during the last half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 to make commitments during the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during those periods 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 4 to 545 million in 2006 compared to 570 million in 2005 the yearoveryear decrease in expense for 2006 resulted largely from the absence of expenses related to our august 2005 ipo including expenses associated with the termination of a longterm incentive plan upon completion of our ipo this decrease was partially offset by additional stockbased compensation expense and additional administrative expenses associated with being a publicly held company both incurred in 2006 

other operating—net 

other operating—net increased to 214 million in 2006 from 141 million in 2005 on an annual basis we review all aspects of the closed bartow complex with respect to asset retirement obligations aros and other plant site closure related activities as a result of our 2006 review we have revised our estimates for water treatment and phosphogypsum stack system closure costs as well as costs to close the bartow plant site additional costs are expected to be incurred to treat water mainly in 2007 and 2008 to accommodate closure of the cooling pond phosphogypsum stack system closure costs associated with the cooling channel are expected to increase due to additional closure work and higher costs for previously identified activities we also expect to incur additional costs related to site closure activities including closure of wastewater treatment systems as well as storm water management consequently we recorded a charge of 149 million primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006 to reflect these revised estimates we also recorded a 33 million charge again primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006 for additional planned demolition activities at bartow in 2005 111 million of adjustments to bartow phosphogypsum stack asset retirement costs were recorded as a result of revised engineering estimates prepared in connection with the preparation of a revised closure plan for the plant city phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond system for a detailed explanation of the accounting for aros at bartow please refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

interest—net 

net interest income increased to 96 million in 2006 from 06 million in 2005 interest expense decreased 79 to 29 million in 2006 from 140 million in 2005 due to the full repayment of our term notes out of our cash and shortterm investments in the third quarter of 2005 this decrease was partially offset by 10 million of interest expense in the second quarter of 2006 related to a canadian tax matter interest income decreased to 125 million in 2006 from 146 million in 2005 as higher average rates of return were more than offset by lower average balances of invested cash 

minority interest 

amounts reported as minority interest represent the interest of the 34 minority holder of cfl’s common and preferred shares the increase in 2006 was due to improved 2006 cfl operating results the improvement in cfl operating results reflects stronger market conditions for nitrogen fertilizers produced in canada 

cf industries holdings inc 

income taxes 

our income tax provision for 2006 was 197 million or an effective tax rate of 372 this compared with a tax provision of 1287 million on pretax earnings for 2005 for 2005 the income tax provision of 1287 million included the following items income tax expense of 354 million on earnings before income taxes a charge of 999 million to establish a valuation allowance as previously discussed a tax benefit of 05 million for adjustments to prior years’ tax returns and a tax benefit related to a canadian income tax refund of 61 million our effective tax rate exclusive of the 999 million noncash charge and the 61 million refund of canadian income taxes was 377 the decrease in the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes results principally from lower state income taxes 

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

in 2005 the domestic nitrogen fertilizer industry which benefited from tight global supply conditions through most of the year was adversely impacted by rising natural gas prices in the third and fourth quarters of the year the domestic phosphate fertilizer industry continued to show improvement due primarily to strong export demand earlier in 2005 and a tighter domestic supplydemand balance in the second half of the year due to hurricanerelated production curtailments our total gross margin decreased by approximately 69 million or 3 to 2092 million in 2005 from 2161 million in 2004 due largely to deteriorating nitrogen fertilizer market conditions in the latter part of the year partially offset by increased selling prices for phosphate fertilizers the net loss of 390 million in 2005 included a 999 million charge to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforwards generated during our preipo operations as a cooperative a 61 million refund of canadian income taxes the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to our accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations that reduced net earnings by 28 million a 283 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt a gain of approximately 140 million on our derivatives due to the early termination of hedge positions recognized in the third quarter an increase of 111 million in bartow phosphogypsum stack asset retirement obligations related to revised engineering cost estimates and 93 million of unrealized marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives 

net sales 

our net sales increased 16 to 19 billion in 2005 compared to 17 billion in 2004 due to higher average selling prices and an increase in phosphate fertilizer sales volumes partially offset by a decrease in nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes nitrogen fertilizer prices in 2005 averaged 19 higher than the prices for similar products in the comparable period of 2004 reflecting strong demand and tight supply phosphate fertilizer prices in 2005 were 10 higher than corresponding prices in 2004 resulting primarily from strong international demand during the first half of the year and tight domestic supply during the second half of 2005 our total annual sales volume was 84 million tons in 2005 compared to 85 million tons in 2004 as a 109000 ton increase in the volume of phosphate fertilizers sold in 2005 was more than offset by a 174000 ton decrease in nitrogen fertilizer sales volume 

cost of sales 

total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged 202 per ton in 2005 compared to 164 per ton in 2004 an increase of 23 primarily due to higher natural gas prices as well as higher purchased product costs phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged 200 per ton in 2005 compared to 187 per ton in the prior year an increase of 7 mainly due to higher phosphate rock and ammonia costs 

cf industries holdings inc 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 36 to 570 million in 2005 compared to 418 million in 2004 the 152 million increase in 2005 was largely due to increased administrative expenses related to completion of our initial public offering 65 million our longterm incentive plan 33 million including expenses associated with the termination of the plan upon completion of our initial public offering and compensation expense associated with our stockbased awards 32 million 

other operating—net 

other operating—net decreased to 141 million in 2005 from 251 million in 2004 the 110 million decrease was due primarily to a 46 million decrease in costs related to the bartow facility in 2005 compared to 2004 22 million of gains realized in 2005 on the sales of a previously idled distribution terminal and excess land at our bartow complex and a 34 million provision recorded in 2004 for environmental remediation requirements at our ahoskie north carolina nitrogen facility which has been closed for 23 years an 118 million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 for future expenditures to treat water at bartow and other bartow environmental remediation requirements prior to that time bartow water treatment costs were expensed as incurred a decrease in recurring bartow water treatment expense in 2005 was partially offset by 111 million of adjustments to bartow phosphogypsum stack asset retirement obligations as a result of revised engineering cost estimates the decrease in recurring bartow water treatment expense in 2005 was due to the accounting treatment prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 for a detailed explanation of the accounting for water treatment costs at bartow please refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

interest—net 

interestnet swung to 06 million of net interest income in 2005 from 168 million of net expense in 2004 interest expense decreased 38 to 140 million in 2005 from 227 million in 2004 primarily due to lower average debt outstanding in 2005 the decrease in debt outstanding in 2005 was due to scheduled principal payments as well as the full repayment of our term notes interest income more than doubled to 146 million in 2005 from 59 million in 2004 as a result of higher average rates of return and to a lesser extent higher average balances of invested cash 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

the 283 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2005 consists of a 264 million penalty associated with the prepayment of our term notes and the writeoff of 19 million of unamortized financing fees related to our longterm debt and our previous senior secured revolving credit facility 

minority interest 

amounts reported as minority interest represent the interest of the 34 minority holder of cfl’s common and preferred shares the decrease in 2005 was due to reduced cfl operating results the deterioration in cfl operating results reflects weaker market conditions for nitrogen fertilizers particularly in the latter half of 2005 

income taxes 

our income tax provision in 2005 included a noncash charge of 999 million recorded in the third quarter as previously discussed a 61 million refund of canadian income taxes received in the third quarter as well as the normal provision for income taxes on earnings our effective tax rate exclusive of 

cf industries holdings inc 

the 999 million noncash charge and the 61 million refund of canadian income taxes was approximately 38 in both 2005 and 2004 an increase in our 2005 effective tax rate due to the tax effect of expenses associated with our initial public offering which are not deductible for income tax purposes was offset by a tax benefit for adjustments for prior years’ tax returns 

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle—net of taxes 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded additional asset retirement obligations due to implementation of fasb interpretation fin no 47— accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and recorded a related charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle reduced net earnings in 2005 by 28 million for a discussion of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle please see the “overview” section of this discussion and analysis

segment review 

our business is organized and managed internally based on two segments the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business which are differentiated primarily by their products the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate 

nitrogen fertilizer business 

the following table presents summary operating data for our nitrogen fertilizer business 

 

1   includes the cost of natural gas purchases and realized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives

2   total production at donaldsonville and medicine hat including the 34 interest of westco our joint venture partner in cfl

3   gross ammonia production including amounts subsequently upgraded onsite into urea andor uan

cf industries holdings inc 

year ended december 31 2006 compared to year ended december 31 2005 

net sales   nitrogen fertilizer net sales were 15 billion for both 2006 and 2005 as higher average ammonia selling prices were for the most part offset by lower sales volume nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 2 to 63 million tons in 2006 compared to 64 million tons in 2005 ammonia and uan sales volumes decreased by 11 and 3 respectively for 2006 compared to the prior year while urea sales volume increased by 4 ammonia sales volumes decreased due primarily to lower sales from our tampa terminal due to us agrichemicals a former customer ceasing phosphate operations in 2005 increases in industry consumption in the fall in anticipation of strong corn and wheat prices offset a spring during which the industry experienced fewer corn acres planted and reduced application rates the decrease in uan sales compared to sales for 2005 was due primarily to less corn acreage planted and reduced demand in the southern portion of the country due to drought conditions both experienced during the first half of 2006 the impact of these factors was partially offset by strong summer and fall fill demand resulting from the anticipation of a stronger uan market later in 2006 and into the spring of 2007 ammonia sales prices increased by 14 for 2006 compared to the prior year primarily due to tight world market conditions and strong fourth quarter domestic demand

cost of sales   total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged 217 per ton for 2006 compared to 202 per ton for 2005 an increase of 7 largely due to unfavorable variances related to natural gas derivatives and higher purchased product costs while the overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied to our donaldsonville facility and cfl’s medicine hat facility decreased by 1 for 2006 versus the cost in 2005 the favorable effect of this variance was more than offset by the impact of the realized losses on natural gas derivatives immediately recognized in cost of sales we recognized 307 million of unrealized marktomarket losses on derivatives in 2006 compared to 93 million in 2005 due to our discontinuing hedge accounting in the last quarter of 2005 and the decline in natural gas prices that occurred during the respective periods we also recorded approximately 140 million of hedge gains in 2005 mainly in the third quarter the costs of finished fertilizer products purchased for resale were approximately 89 million higher in 2006 than in 2005 due to the overall increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices as well as an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by purchased products both factors mainly occurring during the first six months of 2006 see the “overview” section of this discussion and analysis for additional information about the impact of accounting for our natural gas derivatives

during 2006 we sold approximately 27 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under our fpp representing approximately 44 of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the period in 2005 we sold approximately 45 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program representing approximately 70 of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the period the lower level of fpp sales volumes in 2006 reflected the hesitancy of our customers during the last half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 to make commitments during the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during those respective periods 

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

net sales   nitrogen fertilizer net sales increased 15 to 15 billion in 2005 compared to 13 billion in 2004 as higher average selling prices more than offset a decrease in sales volume ammonia urea and uan sales prices increased by 14 21 and 18 respectively in 2005 compared to the prior year the increase in ammonia prices in the first half of 2005 was due to strong us demand and tight supply conditions in midwestern us markets during the last half of 2005 the sharp increase in natural gas prices and the resulting drop in domestic production caused ammonia prices to increase urea prices increased in 2005 due to a tight world market caused by plant outages abroad reduced domestic production resulting from higher natural gas prices and the impact of increased buying related to demand that had been deferred from previous periods an improved overall nitrogen fertilizer market earlier in

2005 combined with tight supplies resulting from reduced domestic production later in the year because of higher natural gas prices supported higher uan selling prices in 2005 our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 3 in 2005 to 64 million tons as compared to 66 million tons sold in 2004 although both ammonia and uan sales volumes decreased by 4 from 2004 urea sales volume was comparable to the prior year the decrease in ammonia sales volume was primarily due to the loss of sales out of our tampa florida terminal due to the loss of a key customer uan sales volume declined in 2005 due to reduced supply availability resulting from scheduled plant turnarounds and production and shipping disruptions caused by two hurricanes 

cost of sales   total cost of sales of nitrogen fertilizers averaged 202 per ton in 2005 compared to 164 per ton in 2004 an increase of 23 largely due to higher natural gas prices higher purchased product costs and unrealized marktomarket losses partially offset by the favorable impact of the early termination of certain natural gas hedge positions associated with our forward pricing program the overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied to our donaldsonville and cfl’s medicine hat facilities increased by 29 in 2005 versus the cost in 2004 mainly due to continued tight market conditions for natural gas and the impact of the two gulf hurricanes purchased product costs were approximately 573 million higher in 2005 than in 2004 due to additional quantities purchased to meet sales commitments as well as the overall increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices previously discussed as previously mentioned we recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in the third quarter of 2005 a gain of approximately 140 million which arose from the early termination of fpprelated natural gas positions we also recognized 93 million of unrealized marktomarket losses on derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2005 as an increase in cost of sales due to our discontinuation of hedge accounting see the “overview” section of this discussion and analysis for additional information about the impact of accounting for our natural gas derivatives

during 2005 we sold approximately 45 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer under our forward pricing program representing approximately 70 of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume in 2004 we sold approximately 36 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program representing approximately 54 of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the year

phosphate fertilizer business 

the following table presents summary operating data for our phosphate fertilizer business 

 

1   p 2 o 5 is the basic measure of the nutrient content in phosphate fertilizer products

year ended december 31 2006 compared to year ended december 31 2005 

net sales   phosphate fertilizer net sales increased 10 to 4823 million for 2006 compared to 4387 million in 2005 due to higher average selling prices and increased sales volumes average phosphate fertilizer prices during 2006 increased by 6 compared to prices in 2005 due to the impact of increased domestic demand on what was already a relatively tight supplydemand balance our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales volumes of 21 million tons in 2006 increased by 4 over the prior year’s level due primarily to stronger domestic demand for dap during the second half of the year during the fourth quarter of 2006 we made our first dap export sales through phoschem an export association representing north american phosphate producers we joined phoschem in october of 2006 phoschem is presently our primary means of exporting phosphate fertilizer products approximately 22 of our 2006 fourth quarter phosphate fertilizer net sales were made through phoschem

cost of sales   phosphate cost of sales averaged 207 per ton for 2006 compared to 200 per ton for 2005 the 4 increase was mainly due to higher ammonia and sulfur costs ammonia prices increased by 6 during 2006 compared to 2005 reflecting stronger global market conditions through the first half of 2006 sulfur costs increased by 3 for 2006 compared to 2005 the increase mainly occurring in the first

six months of 2006 reflected the lingering impact of supply disruptions that occurred in 2005 due to hurricane activity 

during 2006 we sold approximately 294000 tons of phosphate fertilizers under our fpp representing approximately 14 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period in 2005 we sold approximately 718000 tons of phosphate fertilizers under this program representing approximately 36 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period the lower level of fpp sales volumes in 2006 reflected the hesitancy of our customers during the last half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 to make commitments during the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during those respective periods 

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

net sales   phosphate fertilizer net sales increased 16 to 4387 million in 2005 compared to 3768 million in 2004 due to a combination of higher average selling prices and increased sales volume our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales of 20 million tons in 2005 represented an increase of 6 compared to 2004 within our total phosphate fertilizer sales sales of dapmap to domestic customers increased by 14 totaling 14 million tons in 2005 compared to 12 million tons in 2004 the increase in sales to domestic customers in 2005 as compared to 2004 is due to increased market penetration average phosphate fertilizer prices in 2005 increased by 10 compared to prices in 2004 due largely to strong international phosphate fertilizer demand in the first half of the year as well as the impact of domestic industry production cuts occurring mainly over the second half of 2005

cost of sales   phosphate cost of sales averaged 200 per ton in 2005 compared to 187 per ton in 2004 the 7 increase was mainly due to higher phosphate rock costs and higher ammonia costs phosphate rock costs increased by 17 in 2005 compared to 2004 due primarily to increased costs resulting from less favorable mining conditions over the first six months of 2005 ammonia prices increased by 10 in 2005 compared to 2004 reflecting stronger global market conditions mainly in the last three quarters of 2005

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of cash are operating cash flow which includes customer advances and our senior secured revolving credit facility our primary uses of cash are operating costs working capital needs capital expenditures and dividends our working capital requirements are affected by several factors including demand for our products selling prices for our products raw material costs freight costs and seasonality factors inherent in the business 

cash balances 

as of december 31 2006 we had cash and cash equivalents of 254 million shortterm investments of 3002 million and a 1027 million current liability attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under our forward pricing program as of december 31 2005 the comparable amounts were 374 million 1793 million and 1316 million respectively our shortterm investments consist of availableforsale auction rate securities that are reported at fair value we believe that our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments our operating cash flows and credit available under our senior secured revolving credit facility are adequate to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 we had 1764 million and 1926 million available respectively under our senior secured revolving credit facility 

cf industries holdings inc 

debt 

notes payable representing amounts owed by cfl to its minority interest holder with respect to advances were 42 million as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under out 250 million senior secured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2006 or december 31 2005 

on august 16 2005 we replaced our 140 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a new 250 million senior secured revolving credit facility the senior secured revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate and is available through august 16 2010 this facility is secured by working capital certain equipment and the donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex the credit facility provides up to 250 million subject to a borrowing base for working capital and general corporate purposes including up to 50 million for the issuance of letters of credit there was 1764 million of available credit under the senior secured revolving credit facility and no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit as of december 31 2006 

on august 17 2005 we repaid in full 2356 million of our outstanding term notes plus associated prepayment penalties and accrued interest in the amount of 293 million with cash on hand and by liquidating shortterm investments 

capital spending 

capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity and to improve plant efficiency in response to the difficult industry environment prior to 2004 we had deferred nonessential capital expenditures whenever it was possible to do so without compromising the operational integrity of our facilities or the safety of our employees the 101 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2006 as compared to 2005 related primarily to greater plant turnaround activity during 2005 we expect to spend approximately 110 million to 120 million on capital expenditures in both 2007 and 2008 the projection for 2007 includes spending carried over from projects initiated in 2006 these amounts also include approximately 24 million in 2007 and 14 million in 2008 for capital expenditures at cfl of which we are obligated to fund 66 

financial assurance requirements 

in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate fertilizer business we are subject to financial assurance requirements previously these financial assurance requirements were satisfied without the need for any advance expenditure of corporate funds provided our financial statements met certain criteria referred to as the financial tests however pursuant to a 2005 amendment to the florida regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure of phosphogypsum stacks we established an escrow account to meet such future obligations in order to take advantage of a safe harbor provision in the regulations that would obviate the need for us to meet the financial test criteria in the future in march of 2006 we contributed 111 million to this escrow account which by rule is earmarked to cover the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for our phosphosgypsum stacks as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure in the first quarter of 2007 we expect to contribute another 94 million over the next nine years we expect to contribute between 40 million and 70 million annually based upon the required funding formula as defined in the regulations and an assumed rate of return of 4 on invested funds the amount of money that will accumulate in the account by the year 2016 including interest earned on invested funds is currently estimated to be approximately 85 million after 2016 contributions to the account are estimated to average less than 10 million annually for the following 17 years the balance in the account is estimated to be approximately 170 million by 2033 the amounts recognized as expense in 

cf industries holdings inc 

operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data these expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the account which are based on the guidelines set forth in the florida regulations ultimately the cash in this account will be used to settle the asset retirement obligations 

additionally florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surfacewatermitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted the demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a cash deposit arrangement based on these current regulations we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in florida utilizing either of these methods 

forward pricing program fpp 

we offer a fpp to our customers under which product may be ordered for future delivery with a significant portion of the sales proceeds generally being collected before the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 we had approximately 1027 million and 1316 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 we had approximately 17 million tons of product and 12 million tons of product respectively committed to be sold under the fpp most of this product was scheduled to ship within 150 days of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively 

while customer advances were a significant source of liquidity in both 2006 and 2005 the level of sales under the fpp is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers’ perceptions of future market fundamentals the lower level as of december 31 2005 reflected the hesitancy of our customers to make commitments in the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during that reporting period 

the level of our customers’ participation in our fpp may vary over time should the level of participation decrease there is a risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings of future periods if the level of sales under the fpp were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase also borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future fpp sales activity 

other liquidity requirements 

we paid cash dividends of 44 million on outstanding common stock during 2006 this amount represents an annual rate equal to 008 per share we expect to pay quarterly dividends at such a rate for the foreseeable future under certain conditions our 250 million senior secured revolving credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends 

we also funded contributions to our us and canadian pension plans totaling 86 million in 2006 we expect to contribute 56 million to our pension plans in 2007

cash flows 

operating activities 

year ended december 31 2006 compared to year ended december 31 2005 

net cash generated from operating activities in 2006 was 2036 million compared to 1372 million in 2005 the 664 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was primarily due to 956 million less cash used to fund working capital in 2006 other major factors affecting operating cash flow during 2006 were a 668 million decrease in operating earnings partially offset by the adjustment for the 214 million noncash effect of unrealized losses on derivatives the 956 million reduction in cash used to fund working capital is the difference between 95 million used in 2006 and 1051 million consumed in 2005 during 2006 accounts receivable increased by 613 million and customer advances decreased by 289 million resulting in a net use of cash of 902 million which was partially offset by a 516 million decrease in inventories and a 171 million decrease in margin deposits the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to more volume shipped under normal commercial terms a significant portion of the sales proceeds for volumes shipped under the fpp is generally received prior to shipment the decrease in customer advances was due primarily to changes in the product mix of outstanding orders and lower perunit contract prices the decrease in inventories reflects lower perunit nitrogen fertilizers manufacturing cost and lower quantities of phosphate fertilizers held at december 31 2006 the decrease in margin deposits was primarily due to lower margin requirements the use of 1051 million in cash in 2005 for working capital changes was primarily due to a 799 million decrease in customer advances and a 148 million change in net product exchanges assets the decrease in customer advances was primarily due to lower levels of forward sales on order as of december 31 2005 as compared to december 31 2004 

on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 a portion of the spare parts inventory has been reclassified from inventory to other noncurrent assets based on our expectations of when these parts will be utilized on the consolidated statements of cash flows corresponding reclassifications have been made to inventory and othernet in operating activities 

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

net cash generated from operating activities in 2005 was 1372 million compared to 3442 million in 2004 the 2070 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was primarily due to a 2064 million increase in cash used to fund working capital net changes in working capital consumed 1051 million of cash in 2005 compared to 1013 million of cash generated by working capital reductions in 2004 during 2005 accounts receivable increased by 92 million inventories increased by 103 million net product exchange assets increased by 148 million and customer advances decreased by 799 million resulting in a net use of cash of 1142 million which was partially offset by a 102 million decrease in margin deposits the increase in accounts receivable was due to higher selling prices in december of 2005 versus december of 2004 and reduced sales volume shipped under the forward pricing program for which a substantial portion of the sales proceeds is generally received prior to shipment the increase in inventories was due to higher per unit manufacturing costs and increased prices for purchased products which were partially offset by reduced quantities held at december 31 2005 the decrease in customer advances was primarily due to lower levels of forward sales on order as of december 31 2005 as compared to december 31 2004 the 1013 million of cash generated by changes in working capital in 2004 was primarily due to a 455 million increase in customer advances a 414 million decrease in accounts receivable and a 441 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses the increase in customer advances in 2004 was due primarily to higher levels of forward sales on order as of december 31 2004 as compared to december 31 2003 the decrease in accounts receivable was due primarily to an 

cf industries holdings inc 

increase in sales volume shipped under the forward pricing program for which a substantial portion of the sales proceeds is generally received prior to shipment the increased accounts payable and accrued expenses were largely related to higher trade credit obligations to our gas suppliers reflecting higher natural gas prices 

on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 amounts owed and due from product exchanges have been reclassified from a net amount in inventory to current assets and current liabilities to conform to the 2005 presentation on the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2005 and 2004 corresponding adjustments have been made to inventory and product exchanges—net these reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income loss or cash flow from operations

obligations 

contractual obligations 

the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 

 

1   based on debt balances and interest rates as of december 31 2006 all our longterm debt was repaid on august 17 2005 see the “overview” section of this discussion and analysis for further information on the transaction

2   represents notes payable to the cfl minority interest holder while the entire principal amount is due december 31 2009 cfl may prepay all or a portion of the principal at its sole option

3   includes anticipated expenditures under certain requirements contracts to transport raw materials and finished product between our facilities the majority of these arrangements allow for reductions in usage based on our actual operating rates amounts set forth above are based on normal operating rates and contracted or spot prices where applicable as of december 31 2006 and actual operating rates and prices may differ

4   includes minimum commitments to purchase natural gas based on prevailing nymex forward prices at december 31 2006 also includes minimum commitments to purchase ammonia and urea for resale and commitments to purchase ammonia and sulfur for use in phosphate fertilizer production the amounts set forth above for these commitments are based on spot prices as of december 31 2006 and actual prices may differ

5   liquid markets exist for the possible resale of the natural gas ammonia and urea purchased for resale and ammonia and sulfur purchased for use in phosphate fertilizer production under the majority of these commitments but gains or losses could be incurred on resale

other longterm obligations 

as of december 31 2006 our other liabilities included balances related to asset retirement obligations aros and environmental remediation liabilities and shutdown costs the estimated timing and amount of cash outflows associated with these liabilities are as follows 

 

1   represents the undiscounted inflationadjusted estimated cash outflows required to settle the aros the corresponding present value of these future expenditures is 871 million as of december 31 2006 and 745 million as of december 31 2005 the increase in the present value of these future expenditures is due to recording changes in estimates on existing aros as previously discussed

we also have unrecorded aros at our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex at cfl’s medicine hat facility and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included is reclamation of land and in the case of donaldsonville reclamation of two effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2006 dollars is between 12 million and 15 million we do not currently believe that there is a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities therefore the table above does not contain any cash flows for these aros see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our aros as described in “—financial assurance requirements” we intend to set aside cash on an annual basis in an escrow account established to cover costs associated with closure of our phosphogypsum stack system this account will be the source of a significant portion of the cash required to settle the aros pertaining to the phosphogypsum stack system

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when title is transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change 

useful lives of depreciable assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed a comprehensive review of the depreciable lives of our production facilities and related assets as well as estimated production capacities used to develop our unitsofproduction uop depreciation expense as a result of this review we increased the depreciable lives of certain assets at our nitrogen production facilities from ten years to fifteen years separately we revised the estimates of production capacities for certain uop assets at our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex and all uop assets at our plant city florida phosphate complex as a result of these changes we expect that depreciation expense will be reduced by approximately 11 million during 2007 

of the 11 million anticipated reduction in depreciation expense approximately 10 million relates to our nitrogen production assets and 1 million relates to our phosphate production assets included in the 10 million expected decrease in depreciation for nitrogen assets is approximately 1 million relating to cfl a joint venture of which we own 66 

cf industries holdings inc 

we review the depreciable lives assigned to our production facilities and related assets on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews 

inventory valuation 

we review our inventory balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operational plans for the inventory and historical price activity of inventory if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we would immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales price ultimately realized were less than our initial estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation 

asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation liabilities 

costs associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the bartow and plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complexes and costs associated with land reclamation activities at our hardee florida phosphate rock mine are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 143— accounting for asset retirement obligations  if the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated asset retirement obligations aros are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service costs associated with the cessation of operations at all of our facilities are accounted for in accordance with fin no 47— accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  this interpretation requires us to recognize a liability for aros for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain the obligations related to closure reclamation and cessation of operations are capitalized at their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded the liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time the asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over their estimated useful life the aggregate carrying value of all of our aros was 871 million as of december 31 2006 and 745 million as of december 31 2005 the increase in the aggregate carrying value of these aros is due to recording changes in estimates on existing aros as previously discussed 

environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated consistent with the requirements of sfas no 5— accounting for contingencies  estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts existing technology sitespecific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations in reporting environmental liabilities no offset is made for potential recoveries all liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur in accordance with gaap environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits changes in laws regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements the amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled 94 million as of december 31 2006 and 79 million as of december 31 2005 

the actual amounts to be spent on aros and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments and cost inflation as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

recoverability of longlived assets 

we review the carrying values of our plant property and equipment on a regular basis in accordance with sfas no 144— accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  if impairment of an asset has occurred an impairment charge is recognized immediately factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume prices inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the recoverability of the values associated with our longlived assets is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the ability of the company to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

upon the completion of our ipo cf industries inc ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes on the date of our ipo cf industries inc had a deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards nols generated from business conducted with cf industries inc’s preipo owners these net operating loss carryforwards totaled 250 million with expirations ranging from 2021 through 2023 the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2005 includes a charge of 999 million to establish a 100 valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to these nols the valuation allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset will be realized since cf industries inc is no longer a cooperative for federal income tax purposes 

in connection with the ipo we entered into a net operating loss agreement with cf industries inc’s preipo owners nol agreement relating to the future treatment of the preipo nols under the nol agreement if it is finally determined that cf industries inc’s net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized subsequent to the ipo we will pay to cf industries inc’s preipo owners an amount equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved 

pension assets and liabilities 

pension assets and liabilities are affected by the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 2385 million at december 31 2006 which was 297 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2006 pbo was computed based on a 570 discount rate which was based on yields for highquality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension liability declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 174 million higher than the amount previously discussed conversely if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 156 million lower the discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2006 was 550 and was the discount rate used to

compute the pbo at december 31 2005 if the discount rate used to compute 2006 pension expense was lower by 50 basis points 2006 pension expense would have been approximately 18 million higher than the amount calculated conversely if the discount rate used to compute 2006 pension expense was higher by 50 basis points 2006 pension expense would have been approximately 17 million lower than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 75 expected longterm rate of return on assets is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher by 50 basis points pension expense for 2006 would have been 09 million lower conversely if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2006 would have been 09 million higher 

retiree medical benefits 

retiree medical benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions including discount rates used to compute the present value of the future obligations and expected increases in health care costs changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs affect the recorded amount of retiree medical benefits expense 

stockbased compensation 

costs associated with stockbased compensation are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 123r— sharebased payment sfas 123r which requires us to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the grant date fair value of all sharebased awards over the service period the fair value of nonqualified stock options granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes option valuation model key assumptions used in the blackscholes option valuation model include expected volatility and expected life the basis for determining these assumptions may change as more experience is obtained with our own historical stock prices and employees’ option exercise behavior 

we accrue the cost of stockbased awards on the straightline method over the applicable vesting period as a result total compensation cost recognized for 2006 on a pretax basis was 81 million as of december 31 2006 on a pretax basis there was approximately 116 million and 14 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonqualified options and restricted stock which is expected to be recognized over 14 and 16 years respectively see note 26 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of stockbased compensation 

recent accounting pronouncements 

we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 158— employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r as of december 31 2006 this statement requires an entity to recognize the funded status of benefit plans as assets andor liabilities on the balance sheet recognize gains and losses prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations in other comprehensive income measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal yearend balance sheet and provide disclosure in the notes of the effects of the amortization of amounts included in other comprehensive income on the next fiscal year’s periodic benefit cost the measurement provisions of the statement had no impact on our consolidated financial statements as our plan assets and benefit obligations were already measured as of yearend the impact of adopting sfas no 158 was an increase in liabilities for defined benefit plans of 479 million a decrease in other noncurrent assets of 03 million a net increase in deferred income tax assets of 181 million and an increase in accumulated other 

cf industries holdings inc 

comprehensive loss of 301 million see notes 3 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of the impact of adopting sfas no 158 

in 2006 financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 48— accounting for uncertainty in income taxes was issued   this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 109— accounting for income taxes  the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return it also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the interpretation is effective for the company beginning january 1 2007 we are performing a review and analysis to determine the impact of the adoption of the interpretation on our consolidated financial statements

forward pricing program fpp 

in mid2003 we instituted a program that has reduced the risk inherent in the relationship between volatile fertilizer prices and natural gas costs for product that we manufacture our basic concept principally applied to nitrogen fertilizers is to fix the price of our principal raw material natural gas coincident with the establishment of the fertilizer sales price which often occurs months in advance of shipment customer advances which typically represent a significant portion of the contract’s sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with the fpp are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as is the case for all of our sales transactions revenue is recognized when title transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost using natural gas derivative instruments or in some cases with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases 

during 2006 we sold approximately 27 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer representing approximately 44 of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume and approximately 294000 tons of phosphate fertilizer representing approximately 14 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume under the fpp in 2005 we sold approximately 45 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer representing approximately 70 of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume and approximately 718000 tons of phosphate fertilizer representing approximately 36 of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume under the fpp during 2004 we sold approximately 39 million tons of fertilizer representing approximately 45 of our sales volume under the fpp as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 we had approximately 17 million tons of product and 12 million tons of product respectively committed to be sold under this program the majority of these amounts were scheduled to ship within 150 days of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively 

as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products and a substantial portion of the cost to manufacture the products under our fpp often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment 

participation in the fpp is affected by market conditions and our customers’ expectations there can be no assurance that we will transact the same percentage of our business under the fpp in the future should the level of participation decrease there is a risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings of future periods

discussion of seasonality impacts on operations 

our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

interest rate fluctuations 

borrowings under variable rate notes payable bear a current market rate of interest such that we are subject to interest rate risk on these borrowings the revolving credit facility bears a similar risk but as of december 31 2006 there were no borrowings under this facility as of december 31 2006 a 100 basis point change in interest rates on our floating rate loans which totaled 42 million would result in a 42000 change in pretax earnings loss on an annual basis 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we are exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar as a result of our 66 economic interest and our 49 common equity interest in cfl at the present time we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to cfl 

commodity prices 

our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to the nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer sales not made under the forward pricing program are sensitive to changes in nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia by approximately 33 

we use natural gas in the manufacture of our nitrogen fertilizer products because natural gas prices are volatile our natural gas acquisition policy includes the objective of providing protection against significant adverse natural gas price movements we manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering periods not exceeding three years the derivative instruments currently used are swaps these contracts reference primarily nymex futures contract prices which represent fair value at any given time the related contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods as of december 31 2006 we had hedged approximately 306 million mmbtus of natural gas most of which related to sales that had been contracted to be sold through our forward pricing program as of december 31 2006 we also establish derivative positions in natural gas that are unrelated to forward pricing program contracts if we consider it appropriate to do so 

cf industries holdings inc 

through the third quarter of 2005 we designated documented and assessed accounting for hedge relationships which resulted primarily in cash flow hedges that required us to record the derivatives as assets and liabilities at their fair value on the balance sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income loss the gain or loss of an effective cash flow hedge was deferred in other comprehensive income loss until the month after the hedged natural gas was used to manufacture inventoried products which approximated the period of inventory turns of upgraded products and the release of the cost of the hedged gas to cost of sales ineffective hedge gains and losses were recorded immediately in cost of sales 

instability in the natural gas market during the last half of 2005 and our resulting decision to supply fpp orders from sources other than production reduced our ability to predict future natural gas requirements consequently we ceased classifying derivatives as cash flow hedges as defined in sfas no 133— accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result while the derivatives are still carried at their fair value on the balance sheet unrealized gains or losses related to the derivatives are recognized in operations as they occur 

we purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of dap and map we attempt to include any price fluctuations related to these raw materials in our selling prices of finished products but there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered we enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices a 10 per related ton change in the cost of a ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change dap production cost by 210 per ton and 380 per ton respectively we also purchase ammonia urea and uan to augment or replace production at our facilities
