loss and loss expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among others historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made although the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

the company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves the amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was 1387 million and 1655 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the aggregate net discount for those reserves after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 452 million and 483 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively at december 31 2021 discount rates by year ranged from 07 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 34 

substantially all discounted workers’ compensation reserves 97 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2021 are excess workers’ compensation reserves in order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period once established no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized the expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the company’s loss payout experience 

the company also discounts reserves for certain other longduration workers’ compensation reserves representing approximately 3 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2021 including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease these reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 

to date known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the company’s operations because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to significant environmental or asbestos exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language 

the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses relating to environmental and asbestos claims on policies written before adoption of the absolute exclusion was 20 million at december 31 2021 and 19 million at december 31 2020 the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years 



 

1 the cumulative effect adjustment resulting from changes in accounting principals relates to the allowance for expected credit losses on reinsurance recoverables that commenced on january 1 2020 due to the adoption of asu 201613 see note 1 for more details 

2 claims occurring during the current year are net of loss reserve discounts of 21 million 10 million and 20 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

3 the change in estimates for claims occurring in prior years is net of loss reserve discount on an undiscounted basis the estimates for claims occurring in prior years decreased by 19 million in 2021 and 21 million in 2020 and increased by 19 million in 2019 respectively 

4 for certain retrospectively rated insurance policies and reinsurance agreements changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years are offset by additional or return premiums 

  

also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 13 reserves for losses and loss expenses included in our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the changes in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2021 as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” in the company’s us regulatory filings is as follows 



 

1 for statutory purposes the company discounts its workers’ compensation reinsurance reserves at 25 as prescribed or permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware in its gaap financial statements the company discounts excess workers’ compensation reserves at the riskfree rate and assumed workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate 

reinsurance 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

us regulation   

our us insurance subsidiaries are principally regulated by their domiciliary state insurance departments and are 

subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the other us jurisdictions in which they do business as of january 1 2022 there are six domiciliary states related to our us insurance subsidiaries 

overview  our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums loss expenses and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than our excess and surplus lines and reinsurance 

subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and 

surplus lines and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

  

legislative and regulatory activity related to the covid19 pandemic in 2020 us state insurance regulators issued directives and guidance in response to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic which encouraged or directed insurance companies to implement accommodations such as extending grace periods for premium payments and forbearing on the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies due to nonpayment of premiums in addition there has been industry and regulatory discussion regarding the appropriate role of pandemic business interruption coverage and whether insurers should be required to provide such coverage in 2020 legislators of several states proposed bills that would mandate retroactive coverage of pandemicrelated business interruption losses to date however none of these proposals has meaningfully progressed or been enacted there appears to be a broadly held and bipartisan consensus that pandemic risk is generally uninsurable absent some kind of publiclyfunded backstop at the federal level there are ongoing discussions regarding a federal response to the risk of future pandemics some of which include proposals to create publicprivate partnerships with insurers it is too early to determine which proposal if any may ultimately gain the support of congress and how any new legislation might affect our business see “risk factors — risks related to our industry — the covid19 pandemic has materially and adversely affected our results of operations and is expected to continue and therefore may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and liquidity” 

holding company statutes  in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations 

we must also annually submit to our lead state regulator an “enterprise risk management report” which identifies the activities and circumstances of any affiliated company that might have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our group or our us licensed insurers 

in addition all states have adopted changes to the holding company act that authorize us insurance regulators to lead or participate in the groupwide supervision of certain international insurance groups in november 2019 the international association of insurance supervisors “iais” an international standard setter adopted a global framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups as discussed below under “ international regulation” this framework includes a riskbased groupwide global insurance capital standard “ics” which is undergoing a fiveyear monitoring period that started in january 2020 

in the united states the national association of insurance commissioners the “naic” has developed a group capital calculation tool that uses a riskbased capital aggregation methodology for all entities in an insurance holding company system the goal is to provide us regulators with a method to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of each entity in a group in a way that applies to all companies regardless of their structure in 2020 the naic adopted amendments to the 

model holding company act and regulation that implement the group capital calculation by requiring the ultimate controlling person of an insurer subject to holding company registration to file the group capital calculation with its lead state regulator the annual filing requirement will become effective once the states have adopted the naic holding company amendments the naic has proposed an accreditation standard for these amendments for a oneyear comment period starting on january 1 2022 

all states have adopted the naics risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act the “orsa model act” which requires an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an own risk and solvency assessment summary report “orsa report” the orsa report is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks under the orsa model act as enacted by the states we are required to 

• regularly no less than annually conduct an orsa to assess the adequacy of our risk management framework and current and estimated projected future solvency position 

• internally document the process and results of the assessment and 

• provide an orsa report annually to the commissioner of insurance of the state of delaware our lead state commissioner 

cybersecurity regulations new york has adopted a cybersecurity regulation for financial services institutions that are authorized by the new york state department of financial services the “nydfs” which applies to our insurance subsidiaries licensed in new york the regulation requires these entities to assess risks associated with their information systems and establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers’ private data and the confidentiality 

integrity and availability of the licensee’s information systems the naic has adopted the insurance data security model law the “cybersecurity model law” for consideration by state legislatures which when adopted by the states establishes standards for data security the investigation of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to or the misuse of certain nonpublic information and reporting to insurance commissioners the cybersecurity model law imposes significant regulatory burdens intended to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of information systems as of december 31 2021 the cybersecurity model law or a form thereof had been adopted by several states including two of our us insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states a drafting note in the cybersecurity model law states that a licensee’s compliance with the new york cybersecurity regulation is intended to constitute compliance with the cybersecurity model law but compliance remains a statebystate issue and we would need to consider any differences in implementation and enforcement of the cybersecurity model law as part of our compliance efforts additionally the federal trade commission amended the “standards for safeguarding customer information rules otherwise known as the “safeguards rule” in 2021 to require covered financial institutions to implement certain data security measures and practices in their information security programs many of the requirements of the amended safeguards rule are similar to the new york cybersecurity regulation and the cybersecurity model law but there are some differences that may impose increased operational burdens and compliance costs 

certain states are developing or have developed regulations related to privacy and data security for example in 2018 california enacted the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which broadly regulates the collection processing and disclosure of california residents’ personal information imposes limits on the “sale” of personal information and grants california residents certain rights to among other things access and delete data about them in certain circumstances ccpa also established a private right of action with potentially significant statutory damages whereby businesses that fail to implement reasonable security measures to protect against breaches of personal information could be liable to affected consumers ccpa became effective on january 1 2020  california subsequently enacted the california privacy rights act “cpra” which amends the ccpa to impose additional limitations and obligations with respect to covered businesses’ use and sharing of certain personal data the cpra will come into full effect in january 2023 compliance with ccpacpra 

may increase the cost of providing our services in california other states have considered – and some states have adopted 

 similar proposals for instance virginia and colorado enacted data privacy laws in 2021 that will come into effect in january 2023 and july 2023 respectively these laws establish in those states many of the same data privacy and security requirements as other existing laws such as the ccpa we cannot predict the impact if any that any proposed or future cybersecurity regulations or state laws will have on our business financial condition or results of operations 

riskbased capital requirements  the naic utilizes a riskbased capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the naic rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any rbc action level as of december 31 2021 

insurance regulatory information system the naic also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios for property and casualty insurers referred to as the insurance regulatory information system “iris” on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 

guaranty funds  our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and the insolvent companys available funds are insufficient to pay policyholders and claimants the amounts to which they are entitled the protection afforded under a states guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums in that state the naic postassessment property and liability insurance guaranty association model act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

additionally state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory propertyliability “shared market” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “fair” plans in addition some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 

dividends  we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

trade practices  state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers including provisions governing marketing and sales practices policyholder services claims management and complaint handling state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 

investment regulation investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind quality and concentration of investments in general these laws and regulations permit investments in federal state and municipal obligations corporate bonds preferred and common equity securities mortgage loans real estate and certain other investments subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications investments that do not comply with these limits and qualifications are deducted in our insurance subsidiaries calculation of their statutory capital and surplus 

terrorism risk insurance the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism pursuant to the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2019 “tripra” the program was extended until december 31 2027 

tripra provides a federal backstop to all us based property and casualty insurers for insurance related losses resulting from any act of terrorism on us soil or against certain us air carriers vessels or foreign missions tripra is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism tripras definition of certified acts includes domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tripra when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism 

under the program the federal government will pay 80 of an insurers covered losses in excess of the insurers applicable deductible the insurers deductible is based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2021 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2022 will be approximately 1135 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 200 million industrywide for any calendar year after 2020 tripra limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

excess and surplus lines  the regulation of our us subsidiaries excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business principally with respect to rates and policy forms strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 

climate change and financial risks  the topic of climate risk has come under increased scrutiny by insurance regulators in september 2020 the nydfs issued a circular letter to new york domestic and foreign authorized insurance companies which impacts our insurance subsidiaries licensed in new york the circular letter states that the nydfs expects insurers to integrate financial risks related to climate change into their governance frameworks risk management processes and business strategies for example the letter states that an insurer should designate a board member or board committee as well as a senior management function that oversees the management of the financial risks associated with climate change 

the nydfs also adopted an amendment to the regulation that governs enterprise risk management effective as of august 13 2021 that requires an insurance group to include certain additional risks such as climate change risk in its enterprise risk management function 

in addition the federal insurance office the “fio” has been instructed by president biden’s executive order on climaterelated financial risk dated may 20 2021 to seek public comment on a series of questions that “will help inform fio’s assessment of climaterelated financial risks for the insurance sector” the fio’s request for information notes that it “plans to … take a leadership role in analyzing how the insurance sector may help mitigate climaterelated risks and to that 

end it will engage with the insurance sector to assess how the sector may help achieve national climaterelated goals including mitigation adaptation and transition to a lower carbon economy” the comment period ended in november 2021 

diversity and corporate governance  insurance regulators are also focused on the topic of race diversity and inclusion on march 16 2021 the nydfs issued a circular letter stating that it expects the insurers it regulates such as our insurance subsidiaries licensed in new york to make diversity of their leadership a business priority and a key element of their corporate governance see “ – human capital resources” below 

federal regulation the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance although federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states and created two new federal government bodies the fio and the financial stability oversight council the “fsoc” the fio does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance although it has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements as discussed below the fio has authority to represent the united states in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the us insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act addresses the roles played by federal regulators at international insurance standardsetting forums and it directs the director of the fio and the board of governors of the federal reserve to support increased transparency at international standardsetting regulatory forums eg the iais these federal regulations also instruct the fio and the federal reserve to achieve consensus positions with the states through the naic prior to taking a position on any insurance proposal by a global insurance regulatory forum 

the doddfrank act authorizes the secretary of the treasury and us trade representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance the us and the european union eu signed such a covered agreement the eu covered agreement in september 2017 the eu covered agreement addresses three areas of prudential supervision reinsurance group supervision and the exchange of information between the us and eu under the eu covered agreement reinsurance collateral requirements will no longer apply to qualifying eu reinsurers that sell reinsurance to the us market and us reinsurers operating in the eu market will no longer be subject to “local presence” requirements the eu covered agreement establishes group supervision practices that apply only to us and eu insurance groups operating in both territories for instance the eu covered agreement states that provided the us has adopted group supervision including worldwide group governance solvency capital and reporting usheadquartered insurance groups with operations in the eu will be supervised at the worldwide level only by us insurance regulators precluding eu insurance supervisors from exercising solvency and capital requirements over the worldwide operations of those insurers 

in december 2018 the us department of the treasury and the office of the us trade representative entered 

into a covered agreement with the uk the “uk covered agreement” and together with the eu covered agreement the “covered agreements” in anticipation of the uk’s exit from the eu the uk covered agreement largely reflects the provisions of the eu covered agreement and incorporates the same timeframes within it under the doddfrank act the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with the covered agreements 

under the terms of the covered agreements state credit for reinsurance laws that result in nonus reinsurers subject to the covered agreements being treated less favorably than us reinsurers may be preempted by the applicable covered agreement beginning on september 1 2022 accordingly in june 2019 the naic adopted amendments to its credit 

for reinsurance model law in order to satisfy the substantive and timing requirements of the covered agreements which amendments have been adopted by our us insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states these amendments will become an naic accreditation standard beginning on september 1 2022 with enforcement beginning on january 1 2023 the amended credit for reinsurance model law also extends the zero reinsurance collateral provisions in the covered agreements to qualified reinsurers domiciled in us jurisdictions that are accredited by the naic and to nonus jurisdictions that have not entered into a covered agreement with the us but which the naic has identified as “reciprocal jurisdictions” pursuant to the naic qualified jurisdiction process we cannot currently predict the impact of these changes to the law or whether any other covered agreements will be successfully adopted and cannot currently estimate the impact of these changes to the law and any such adopted covered agreements on our business financial condition or operating results 

the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states’ financial stability in the event of the insurer’s material financial distress or failure ie a “systemically important financial institution” or a “nonbank sifi” an insurer so designated by the fsoc will be subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards there are currently no such nonbank sifis designated by the fsoc the fsoc changed its process for designating nonbank sifis effective in january 2020 by adopting an activitiesbased approach and moving away from the entitiesbased approach 

based upon our current business model and balance sheet we do not believe that we will be designated by the fsoc as such an institution although the potential impact of any future amendments to the doddfrank act on the us insurance industry is not clear our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically important nonbank financial companies 

international regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by the prudential regulation authority “pra” andor the financial conduct authority “fca” the pra’s primary objectives with regard to insurers are to promote the safety and soundness of insurers and to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for current and future policyholders while the fca has three operational objectives i to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers ii to protect and enhance the integrity of the united kingdom’s financial system and iii to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the financial services markets the pra and fca employ a variety of regulatory tools to achieve their objectives including periodic auditing and reporting requirements risk assessment reviews minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements dividend restrictions in certain cases approval requirements governing the appointment of key officers approval requirements governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements 

our lloyd’s managing agency is also regulated by lloyd’s and the lloyd’s syndicate business is subject to lloyd’s supervision through lloyd’s we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of lloyd’s international licenses in each such country we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country our insurance subsidiary based in liechtenstein is regulated by the financial market authority of liechtenstein fma which has regulatory tools analogous to those of the uk regulators noted above 

additionally uk and liechtenstein laws and regulations also impact us as “controllers” of our europeanregulated subsidiaries whereby we are required to notify the appropriate authorities about significant events relating to such regulated subsidiaries’ controllers ie persons or entities which have certain levels of direct or indirect voting power or economic interests in the regulated entities as well as changes of control and to submit annual reports regarding their controllers the prafca’s senior managers and certification regime and analogous regulation in liechtenstein further provide regulatory frameworks for standards of fitness and propriety conduct and accountability for individuals in positions of responsibility at insurers in addition certain employees are individually registered at lloyd’s 

following the expiry of the transition period for the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu on december 31 2020 an insurance company with authorization to write insurance business in the uk is no longer permitted to provide crossborder services on a “passporting” basis in the remaining member states of the european economic area “eea” a group including member states of the eu and norway liechtenstein and iceland instead uk insurance companies are now required to establish either a subsidiary or a branch in an eea member state and apply for direct authorization with the local regulator in that jurisdiction 

eea insurers have similarly lost their right to provide crossborder services on a “passporting” basis into the uk as a result the uk branch of our liechtenstein subsidiary has applied for direct authorization to carry on insurance business in the uk in the meantime the branch is currently able to perform regulated insurance business in the uk under the supervision of the prafca pursuant to the uk ‘temporary permissions regime’ while the application is being considered 

see below “risks relating to our businessthe united kingdom leaving the eu could adversely affect our business” for more information 

our insurance business throughout the eu and eea is subject to “solvency ii” an insurance regulatory regime governing among other things capital adequacy and risk management which became effective on january 1 2016 following the uk’s withdrawal from the eu and the expiry of the transition period on december 31 2020 our lloyd’s managing agency and the uk branch of our liechtenstein subsidiary are now subject to a separate uk prudential regime this domestic regime is identical to solvency ii from january 1 2021 however the two regimes may diverge over time the uk has undertaken a review of solvency ii and of the regulatory regime applicable to uk authorized insurers and reinsurers 

the uk has undertaken a review of solvency ii and of the regulatory regime applicable to uk authorized insurers and reinsurers the uk’s hm treasury is now working alongside the pra to prepare a package of proposed reforms to the uk’s domestic regulatory regime for consultation in early 2022 similarly the european commission has undertaken its own review of solvency ii and on september 22 2021 published a package of proposed legislative reforms for amending the existing regulatory framework this proposed legislation is now being discussed by the european parliament and council 

solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency under solvency ii it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii currently the us system of insurance regulation relating to group supervision is not deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii by european union authorities the pra will also perform separate but 

comparable supervision of group solvency under the uk’s own domestic prudential regime where a us holding company is a parent of a subsidiary uk insurer or reinsurer 

the liechtenstein financial services regulator the fma is the group supervisor for our europeanregulated subsidiaries however the covered agreements prohibit any eu supervisor or the pra as applicable from exercising groupwide supervision at any level above the highest company organized in the country of that supervisor 

we must also comply with the eu general data protection regulation eu 2016879 “gdpr” which took effect in may 2018 the regulation’s goal is to impose increased individual rights and protections for all personal data located in or originating from the eu the data protection act 2018 and the uk general data protection regulation which is the retained eu law version of the gdpr by virtue of the european union withdrawal act 2018 and as amended by the data protection privacy and electronic communications amendments etc eu exit regulations 2019 together “uk gdpr” regulate data protection for all individuals within the uk both the gdpr and the uk gdpr are extraterritorial in that they apply to all businesses in the eu and the uk respectively and any business outside the eu and the uk that process eu andor uk personal data of individuals in the eu andor the uk moreover there are significant fines associated with noncompliance in particular we need to monitor our compliance with all relevant member states’ laws and regulations including where permitted derogations from the gdpr and the uk gdpr are introduced the introduction of the gdpr and the uk gdpr and any resultant changes in eu member states’ or uk national laws and regulations has increased our compliance obligations and has necessitated the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data and has required us to change our business practices regarding these matters 

in addition we may become subject to or affected by regulatory policies adopted by the iais an international standard setter consisting of supervisors and regulators from more than 200 jurisdictions the iais has been working on several initiatives to consider changes to insurer solvency standards and group supervision of companies in a holding company system in response to the increasing globalization of the insurance sector in november 2019 the iais formally adopted a global framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups “iaigs” which is referred to as the common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups or “comframe” comframe is intended to provide a framework of basic standards for iaigs and a process for supervisors to cooperate in the supervision of iaigs also in november 2019 the iais adopted a riskbased groupwide global insurance capital standard “ics” that will apply to iaigs and ultimately form a part of comframe the ics commenced a fiveyear monitoring period in january 2020 which is being used for confidential reporting and discussion in supervisory colleges to provide feedback to the iais on the ics’s design and performance but will not trigger any supervisory action following this monitoring period the ics is expected to be implemented in 2025 as a groupwide prescribed capital requirement for iaigs and integrated into the rest of comframe as noted above under “ us regulation” it is unclear how the development of the ics will interact with existing capital requirements for insurance companies in the united states and the naic’s development of the gcc 

our international operations are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in mexico australia and canada and in certain other countries in europe south america and southeast asia generally our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements while each country imposes licensing solvency auditing and financial reporting requirements the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially key areas where country regulations may differ include i the type of financial reports to be filed ii a requirement to use local intermediaries iii the amount of reinsurance permissible iv the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates and v the type and frequency of regulatory examinations 

competition   

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with many insurance companies of various sizes as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as selfinsured retentions or captive programs transacting business in the united states and internationally we compete directly with a large number of these companies competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our businesses can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our businesses establish their own pricing practices based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit 

competition for insurance business within the united states comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers our specialty businesses compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers our regional businesses compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers additionally direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional businesses by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company we compete internationally with native insurance operations both large and small which in some cases are related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

competition for reinsurance business which is especially strong comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance partner re and others 

in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively

other information about the companys business 

we maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition our businesses develop new coverages or enter lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 

seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance businesses although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms wildfires earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 

we have no customer that accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues 

compliance by w r berkley and its subsidiaries with federal state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below occur our businesses results of operations andor financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in addition to those described below our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

risks relating to our industry   

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties in demand and pricing causing cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business in recent years we have faced significant competition in our business as a result of new entrants and capital providers as well as existing insurers seeking to gain or maintain market share recently premium rates have increased at an accelerating pace for most lines of business while they have decreased in others most notably workers compensation the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic or social inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return have impacted rate adequacy with interest rates remaining at or near historic lows these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which can pressure premium rates in certain areas and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume in some parts of our business   

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies diversified financial services companies and insurtech companies competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided including ease of doing business over the internet speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written in recent years the insurance industry has undergone consolidation which may further increase 

competition in some parts of our business and may cause our insurance subsidiaries to incur greater customer retention and acquisition expenses affecting the profitability of existing and new business 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial andor marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance market include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers 

the insurance industry continues to attract new capital which leads to increased competition in our business recently insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business excluding workers compensation however loss costs have also increased and the duration and magnitude of the improving pricing environment remains uncertain with the low level of interest rates available current price levels for certain lines of business may remain below the prices required for us to achieve our longterm return objectives we expect to continue to face strong competition in some parts of our business 

in recent years various types of investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital or access to thirdparty capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively in addition technology companies or other third parties have created and may in the future create technologyenabled business models processes platforms or alternate distribution channels that may adversely impact our competitive position in some parts of our business 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves   

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 154 billion as of december 31 2021 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on managements assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions both inflation overall and medical cost inflation which has historically been greater than inflation overall can have an adverse impact in addition although 

the company has estimated the potential covid19 impact to its contingency and event cancellation workers’ compensation and other lines of business under a number of possible scenarios due to covid19’s continued evolving impact there remains a high degree of uncertainty around the company’s covid19related reserves 

reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain   

as industry practices and economic legal judicial social technological and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include but are not limited to 

• judicial expansion of policy coverage and a greater propensity to grant claimants more favorable amounts and the impact of new theories of liability 

• plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers including us in purported class action litigation relating to claimshandling and other practices 

• social inflation trends including higher and more frequent claims more favorable judgments and legislated increases 

• medical developments that link health issues to particular causes resulting in liability claims 

• claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies including cyber security related risks 

• claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions and 

• increased claims due to third party funding of litigation 

in some instances these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies as a result the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued 

in addition the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue to remove limitations on recovery to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business 

the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes   

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results for example catastrophe losses net of reinsurance recoveries were 202 million in 2021 including covid19 related losses 340 million in 2020 including covid19 related losses and 90 million in 2019 similarly manmade catastrophes can also have a material impact on our financial results 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes tsunamis hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires pandemics as well as terrorist and other manmade activities including drilling mining and other industrial accidents the bankruptcy of a major company war or other military actions social unrest 

cyber events or terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and longerterm natural catastrophe trends may be changing due to climate change causing increased variability and unpredictability the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic has previously materially and adversely affected our results of operations and may further materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and liquidity 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic including the related impact on the us and global economies had materially and adversely affected our results of operations we expect the pandemic and its impact on our business may continue and potentially even worsen but we cannot predict the magnitude or duration of its continued impact particularly given the great uncertainties associated with covid19 including regarding the reopening of the us and global economies and the recovery from its devastating economic and other effects the ultimate impact of covid19 on our results of operations financial position and liquidity is not yet known and likely will not be known for some time but includes the following 

adverse legislative and regulatory action legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to covid19 may adversely affect us particularly in our workers’ compensation and property coverages businesses for example our business may be subject to certain initiatives including but not limited to legislative and regulatory action that seeks to retroactively mandate coverage for losses that our insurance policies would not otherwise cover and which were not priced to cover legislative and regulatory action providing for shifting presumptions with respect to the burdens of proof for “essential” workers on workers’ compensation coverages and varying definitions of “essential” workers actions prohibiting us from cancelling insurance policies in accordance with our policy terms or nonrenewing policies at their natural expiration andor orders to provide premium refunds grant extended grace periods for premium payments and provide extended time to pay past due premiums any such action would likely increase both our underwriting losses and our expenses and any legal challenges to any such action could take years to resolve 

claim losses related to covid19 may exceed reserves  as of december 31 2021 we recorded approximately 274 million for covid19related losses of the 274 million of covid19related losses 239 million are reported losses and 35 million is booked as ibnr our reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown given the great uncertainties associated with covid19 and its impact and the limited information upon which our current assumptions and assessments have been made our reserves and the underlying estimated level of claim losses and costs arising from covid19 may materially change 

claim losses and adjustment expenses may increase  as the effects of covid19 on industry practices and economic legal judicial social and other environmental conditions occur unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverages may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent including in the area of property coverages where physical damage requirements and communicable disease exclusions are currently being challenged or by increasing the number andor size of claims each of which could adversely impact our results 

reinsurance  we purchase reinsurance in order to transfer part of the risk that we have assumed by writing insurance policies to reinsurance companies in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with assuming such risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred to the reinsurer it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders there may be uncertainty surrounding the availability of reinsurance coverage for covid19related losses as our reinsurers may dispute the applicability of reinsurance to such losses including the application of reinsurance reinstatements and as a result our reinsurers may refuse to pay reinsurance recoverables related thereto or they may not pay them on a timely basis in addition we may be unable to renew our current reinsurance coverages or obtain appropriate new reinsurance covers with respect to certain exposures under our policies including covid19related exposures and therefore our net exposures could increase or if we are unwilling to bear such increase in net exposure we may reduce our level of underwriting commitments 

premium volumes may be negatively impacted  the demand for insurance is significantly influenced by general economic conditions consequently reduced economic activity relating to the covid19 pandemic is likely to decrease demand for our insurance products and services and negatively impact our premium volumes and in certain cases may result in return of premiums due to a decrease in exposures this may continue for an indefinite period with the magnitude of the impact impossible to predict in addition as we continue to evaluate the effects of covid19 on the insurance coverages we currently offer our appetite for providing certain coverages in various jurisdictions may change which could further negatively impact our premium volumes any such reduction in our premiums would likely cause our expense ratio to rise 

investments  further disruptions in global financial markets due to the continuing impact of covid19 could cause us to incur additional unrealized andor realized investment losses beyond the investment fund losses incurred in prior years including impairments in our fixed maturity portfolio and other investments in addition the economic uncertainty resulting from covid19 may result in a further decline in interest rates which may negatively impact our net investment income from future investment activity 

credit risk  as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face greater credit risk from our policyholders independent agents and brokers in connection with the payment and remittance of premiums as a result of the economic conditions caused by covid19 similarly our credit risk related to the reimbursement of deductibles from policyholders and in connection with reinsurance recoverables has increased 

operational disruptions and costs  our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management or a significant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our agents brokers suppliers or other third party service providers are unable to continue to work because of illness government directives or otherwise in addition our agents brokers suppliers and other third party service providers which we rely on for key aspects of our operations are subject to risks and uncertainties 

related to the covid19 pandemic which may interfere with their ability to fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreedupon terms in response to the covid19 pandemic we have in place remote working policies which have resulted in disruptions to our business routines heightened risk to cybersecurity attacks and data security incidents and a greater dependency on internet and telecommunication access and capabilities 

changing climate conditions may alter the frequency and increase the severity of catastrophic events and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results 

over the past several years changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming appear to have contributed to the unpredictability frequency and severity of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures there is a growing scientific consensus that global warming and other climate change are altering the frequency severity andor peril characteristics of catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes windstorms floods and other natural disasters such changes make it more difficult for us to predict and model catastrophic events reducing our ability to accurately price our exposure to such events and mitigate our risks any increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters may adversely affect our financial condition and results 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts   

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2019 “tripra” for up to 80 of our covered losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2021 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2022 is approximately 1135 million in addition the coverage provided under tripra does not apply to reinsurance that we write to the extent that our reinsurers have excluded coverage for certain terrorist acts or have priced this coverage at rates that make purchasing such coverage economically infeasible we may not have reinsurance protection and could be exposed to potential losses as a result of any acts of terrorism 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business   

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered in the united states by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

• standards of solvency including riskbased capital measurements 

• restrictions on the nature quality and concentration of investments 

• limitations on the amount of dividends tax distributions intercompany loans and other payments that can be made without prior regulatory approval 

• requirements pertaining to certain methods of accounting 

• evaluating enterprise risk to an insurer 

• rate and form regulation pertaining to certain of our insurance businesses 

• potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired insolvent or failed insurance companies and 

• involvement in the payment or adjudication of catastrophe or other claims beyond the terms of the policies 

state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters our insurance business internationally is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations outside the united states 

federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to conditions in the financial markets global insurance supervision and other factors may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 

the doddfrank act effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant nonbank financial companies including insurance companies be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve the doddfrank act also established a federal insurance office “fio” which is authorized to study monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure our business could be affected by changes whether as a result of potential changes to the doddfrank act to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

the topic of climate risk has come under increased scrutiny by insurance regulators in september 2020 the nydfs issued a circular letter to new york domestic and foreign authorized insurance companies which impacts our insurance subsidiaries licensed in new york the circular letter states that the nydfs expects insurers to integrate financial risks related to climate change into their governance frameworks risk management processes and business strategies the nydfs also adopted an amendment to the regulation that governs enterprise risk management effective as of august 13 2021 that requires an insurance group to include certain additional risks such as climate change risk in its enterprise risk management function in addition the fio has been instructed by president biden’s executive order on climaterelated financial risk dated may 20 2021 to seek public comment on a series of questions that “will help inform fio’s assessment of climaterelated financial risks for the insurance sector” the fio’s request for information notes that it “plans to … take a leadership role in analyzing how the insurance sector may help mitigate climaterelated risks and to that end it will engage with the insurance sector to assess how the sector may help achieve national climaterelated goals including mitigation adaptation and transition to a lower carbon economy” these measures may subject us to increased oversight at the state and federal level 

state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in the united states although congress has considered various proposals regarding federal regulation of insurance in addition to the changes brought about by the doddfrank act such as proposals for the creation of an optional federal charter for insurance companies we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution in addition the new us administration and the volatile political environment may increase the chance of other federal legislative and regulatory changes that could affect us in ways we cannot predict 

with respect to international measures solvency ii the eu regime concerning the capital adequacy risk management 

and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers may affect our insurance businesses implementation of solvency ii in eu member states occurred on january 1 2016 and as the solvency ii regime evolves over time we may be required to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance in particular the european commission has undertaken a review of solvency ii and on september 22 2021 published a package of proposed legislative reforms for amending the existing regulatory framework this proposed legislation is now being discussed by the european parliament and the european commission  in addition despite the waiver of the solvency ii group capital requirements we received solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers additionally our capital requirements and compliance requirements may be adversely affected if the european commission does not deem the insurance regulatory regimes of the jurisdictions outside the eu in which we have insurance or reinsurance companies domiciled to be “equivalent” to solvency ii 

similarly following the uk’s withdrawal from the eu and the expiry of the transition period on december 31 2020  our uk subsidiaries are now subject to a separate uk prudential regime to which the same considerations will apply the uk’s domestic prudential regime is currently identical to solvency ii although the two regimes and their respective requirements may diverge over time the uk has already declared that it considers the solvency ii regime as “equivalent” to its own however the eu is still determining whether to make “equivalency” declarations in respect of the uk’s prudential regime it is also possible that any “equivalency” determinations made by either side could be withdrawn in the future which would adversely affect our capital and compliance requirements 

if our compliance with solvency ii the uk’s prudential regime or any other regulatory regime is challenged we may be subject to monetary or other penalties in addition in order to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements or as a result of any investigation including remediation efforts we could be required to incur significant expenses and undertake additional work which in turn may divert resources from our business 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes 

in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may further restrict the conduct of our business 

risks relating to our business 

our expanding international operations expose us to increased investment political legalregulatory and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america canada mexico scandinavia the asiapacific region south africa and australia expose us to increased investment political legalregulatory and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our investments in nonusdenominated assets are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

we face additional risks as a result of our international operations which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition including burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and the associated risk and costs of noncompliance exposure to undeveloped or evolving legal systems which may result in unpredictable or inconsistent application of laws and regulations exposure to commercial political legal or regulatory corruption political economic or other instability in countries in which we conduct business including possible terrorist acts the imposition of tariffs trade barriers or other protectionist laws or business practices that favor local competition increased costs and adverse effects on our business changes to visa or immigration policies diminished ability to enforce our contractual rights potential increased risk of data breaches differences in cultural environments sociopolitical instability social political or economic instability resulting from climate change changes in regulatory requirements including changes in regulatory treatment of certain products or services exposure to local economic conditions and its impact on our clients’ performance and creditworthiness and restrictions on the repatriation of nonus investments and earnings 

the united kingdom leaving the eu could adversely affect our business 

in accordance with the withdrawal agreement implementing the uk leaving the eu “brexit” the uk formally left the eu on january 31 2020 the agreement provided for a transitional period which ended on december 31 2020 during which time the uk continued to enjoy the same rights and obligations as it had as a member state though without participating in the eu institutions during the transitional period the uk and the eu negotiated a longterm agreement covering among other things the terms of trade between them culminating in the execution of the entry into a “trade and cooperation agreement” 

however notwithstanding the finalization of the trade and cooperation agreement between the uk and the eu uncertainty remains regarding the impact of brexit including the implementation and enforcement of terms and conditions of the agreement and the uk’s future relationship with the eu brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and differing laws and regulations between the uk and the eu specifically in relation to financial services the trade and cooperation agreement 

did not provide for eu and uk regulated firms to be able to access each other’s markets via passporting rights both eu and uk insurers therefore lost their respective passporting rights from january 1 2021 it is also unclear whether the eu will make “equivalence” determinations in respect of relevant aspects of uk financial services regulation as a result the uk branch of our liechtenstein subsidiary has applied to be directly authorized to perform insurance business in the uk which application remains under consideration 

more generally barriers to trade resulting from brexit could affect the attractiveness of the uk and impact our uk business we also face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences related to brexit including with respect to volatility in financial markets exchange rates and interest rates these uncertainties could increase the volatility of or reduce our investment results in particular periods or over time brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies 

any of these potential effects and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our president and ceo executive chairman senior executive officers presidents of our businesses experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to 

maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new products and markets 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses   

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis this failure to pay or failure to pay on a timely basis may be due to factors such as whether reinsurers their affiliates or certain indemnitors have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2021 the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 2923 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk certain of these amounts are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

we are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders independent agents and brokers 

in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business including credit risk relating to policyholders independent agents and brokers for example our policyholders independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds 

as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn while we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms our efforts may not be successful for example to reduce such credit risk we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us in cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged andor the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit 

we are rated by am best standard  poors moodys and fitch and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poors moodys and fitch our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings especially given that rating agencies may change their criteria or increase capital requirements for various rating levels for instance standard  poors has recently proposed changes to its rating model which could impact our rating depending on final changes that are implemented 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poors moodys or fitch our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a ratings downgrade could also adversely limit our access to capital markets which may increase the cost of debt a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

if conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable which may result from disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so on terms acceptable to us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful our financial results could be adversely affected by acquired businesses not performing as projected unforeseen liabilities routine and unanticipated transactionrelated charges diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges or growth strategies loss of key employees challenges in integrating information technology systems of acquired companies with our own amortization of expenses related to intangibles charges for impairment of longterm assets or goodwill and indemnification the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience difficulties with our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems our ability to conduct our business could be negatively or severely impacted   

our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe terrorist attack or industrial accident or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if our business continuity plans or system security does not sufficiently address such a business interruption system failure or service denial our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed 

failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability  

although we have taken steps intended to protect our data and information technology systems and mitigate the risk of harm caused by cybersecurity incidents or breaches no safeguards are perfect and any failure of these safeguards could cause a substantial disruption of our business operations which could result in service interruptions data security compromises regulatory action and other similar operational and legal issues as well as substantial remediation and other costs while to our knowledge we have not recently experienced any material security incidents we are constantly managing an influx of attempts and efforts to infiltrate and compromise our systems and data our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks computer viruses hackers employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches our electronic transmission of personal confidential and proprietary information to third parties with whom we have business relationships and our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security while we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these thirdparty vendors and others with whom we do business our vendors and third parties could still suffer data breaches that could result in the exposure of sensitive data and the infiltration of our computer systems our failure to effectively protect sensitive personal andor proprietary information whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors could result in significant monetary and reputational damages material adverse effects to our financial condition costly litigation or other regulatory enforcement 

actions these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security including required compliance with the gdpr ccpa cpra and additional statespecific privacy statutes and regulations could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs as a result our ability to conduct our 

business could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective   

our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting claim processing and investment activities many of which are highly complex these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies as well as legal and regulatory standards including those related to privacy anticorruption antibribery and global finance and insurance matters our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance that the control systems objectives will be met if our controls are not effective it could lead to financial loss unanticipated risk exposure including underwriting credit and investment risk or damage to our reputation 

we could be adversely affected by recent and future changes in us federal income tax laws 

tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 fundamentally overhauled the us tax system by among other significant changes reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 in the context of the taxation of us propertycasualty insurance companies such as the company the act also modifies the loss reserve discounting rules and the proration rules that apply to reduce reserve deductions to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate it is possible that other legislation could be introduced and enacted by the current congress or future congresses that could have an adverse impact on us new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying provisions of the act may be forthcoming we cannot predict if when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect or their potential impact on us 

limitations in risk management and loss limitation methods may adversely impact our business 

we seek to effectively manage risk and limit our losses in a variety of ways including through effective underwriting tailoring policy terms and the use of reinsurance however there are certain limitations in these and similar tactics and as a result loss levels may be higher than modeled or otherwise expected which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

increased scrutiny on social responsibility and the efforts we take to implement related measures or the failure to take such measures may adversely impact our business 

there is increased scrutiny from regulators and investors on the measures companies take to be socially responsible although we have made efforts to be responsible in this manner for example through our commitment to fostering a unifying culture and encouraging innovation across our operating units these types of pressures may nonetheless present challenges and have an adverse impact on our business in addition we may be subject to negative publicity based on a failure or perceived failure to achieve various social responsibility initiatives and goals relating to diversity equity and inclusion and commitment to longterm sustainability we may announce from time to time or based on an actual or perceived increase in related risks as a result of our or our industry’s business activities 

risks relating to our investments   

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations   

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2021 our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 166 billion or 699 of our total investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 52 state and municipal securities 203 corporate securities 337 assetbacked securities 270 mortgagebacked securities 65 and foreign government 73 

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise if significant inflation or an increase in interest rates were to occur the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would be negatively impacted conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations additionally given the low interest rate environment we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals 

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession during periods of market disruption it 

may be difficult to value certain of our securities particularly if trading becomes less frequent andor market data becomes less observable there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the then current financial environment in such cases more securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment 

although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue many states and municipalities operate under deficits or projected deficits the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuers ability to perform its obligations thereunder additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to actions by the federal reserve economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we have invested a portion of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets which are subject to significant volatility and may decline in value 

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets at december 31 2021 our investment in these assets was approximately 56 billion or 235 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents 

merger and arbitrage trading securities were 12 billion or 50 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2021 merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

real estate related investments including directly owned investment funds and loans receivable were 22 billion or 93 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2021 we also invest in real estate financial services energy transportation and other investment funds the values of these investments are subject to fluctuation based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and the related asset valuations in particular in addition our investments in real estate related assets and other alternative investments are less liquid than our other investments 

these investments are subject to significant volatility as a result of the conditions in the financial and commodity markets and the global economy 

risks relating to limitations on dividends from subsidiaries and antitakeover provisions 

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts 

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and competitive pressures on maintaining financial strength ratings and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries during 2022 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 966 million future regulatory actions could further restrict our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to pay us dividends as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations pay dividends or repurchase shares 

laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable and may restrict a stockholders ability to purchase our common stock 

generally united states insurance holding company laws require that before a person can acquire control of an insurance company prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is domiciled pursuant to applicable laws and regulations “control” over an insurer is generally presumed to 

exist if any person directly or indirectly owns controls holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 or more of the voting securities of that insurer or any parent company of such insurer indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock thus the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled are likely to apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common stock some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates on the one hand and the target insurer and its affiliates on the other hand have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state additionally many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements 

these provisions can also lead to the imposition of conditions on an acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 

certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 

these provisions include 

• our classified board of directors and the ability of our board to increase its size and to appoint directors to fill newly created directorships 

• the requirement that 80 of our stockholders must approve mergers and other transactions between us and the holder of 5 or more of our shares unless the transaction was approved by our board of directors prior to such holders acquisition of 5 of our shares and 

• the need for advance notice in order to raise business or make nominations at stockholders meetings 

these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

w r berkley corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the united states and operates worldwide in two segments of the property and casualty business insurance and reinsurance  monoline excess our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches it also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics while providing our business units with certain operating autonomy our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital investment reinsurance enterprise risk management and actuarial financial and corporate legal staff support the company’s primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments 

an important part of our strategy is to form new businesses to capitalize on various opportunities over the years the company has formed numerous businesses that are focused on important parts of the economy in the us including healthcare cyber security energy and agriculture and on growing international markets including the asiapacific region south america and mexico 

the profitability of the company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time an insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural and other disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic or social inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses general insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity ie the level of capital employed in the industry and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital 

the company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income and investment gains the company’s invested assets are invested principally in fixed maturity securities the return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities returns available on fixed maturity investments have been at low levels for an extended period 

the company also invests in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets the companys investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced and the company expects to continue to experience greater fluctuations in investment income the companys share of the earnings or losses from investment funds is generally reported on a onequarter lag in order to facilitate the timely completion of the companys consolidated financial statements 

on february 23 2022 the company announced that it has entered into an agreement for the sale of a real estate investment consisting of an office building located at 52 lime street london uk known as “the scalpel” for £718 million subject to agreed upon adjustments the transaction is scheduled to close on march 7 2022 the company estimates that it will realize a pretax gain of more than 300 million in the first quarter of 2022 subject to adjustment for final transaction expenses and certain items including the impact of the foreign exchange rate at the date of the close 

the covid19 pandemic including the related impact on the us and global economies has materially and adversely affected our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 the company recorded approximately 58 million for current accident year covid19related losses net of reinsurance at the same time covid19 has led to reduced loss frequency in certain lines of business which has begun to return to prepandemic levels as many economies and legal systems have reopened as a result of higher levels of vaccination the ultimate impact of covid19 on the economy and the company’s results of operations financial position and liquidity is not within the company’s control and remains unclear due to among other factors uncertainty in connection with its claims reserves and reinsurance recoverables 

the scope duration and magnitude of the direct and indirect effects of covid19 continue to evolve in ways that are difficult or impossible to anticipate while many of the potential impacts on the company have receded as populations have begun to become vaccinated new variants of the covid19 virus including the “omicron” variant and the slowing of vaccination rates among certain populations continue to create risks to the company as a result the impact of covid19 on the company’s results of operations for the year of 2021 is not necessarily indicative of its impact for 2022 or beyond despite the effects of covid19 to date the company’s financial position and liquidity improved for the year ended december 31 2021 

critical accounting estimates 

the following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses assumed reinsurance premiums and otherthantemporary impairments of investments management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments 

reserves for losses and loss expenses  to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among other things historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent a certain calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to uncertainty these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations the company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each business these methods include paid loss development incurred loss development paid and incurred bornhuetterferguson methods and frequency and severity methods in circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others that method is used to set the point estimate for example the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data for new lines of business where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods the actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered industry loss experience is used to supplement the company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the company’s own data is limited the actuarial data is analyzed by line of business coverage and accident or policy year as appropriate for each business 

the establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses these qualitative considerations include among others the impact of reunderwriting initiatives changes in the mix of business changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits the expansion of coverage exclusions whether or not defense costs are within policy limits and changes in deductibles and attachment points 

the key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is priced and written before any actual claims experience has emerged this expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each business expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the longtail lines such as excess casualty and claims with a high medical component such as workers’ compensation reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses and are derived from the company’s own experience and industry data the paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred however different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates 

loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves including expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits retentions rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 

another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses less ibnr is required for lines with short reporting lags as a result loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates for lines with short reporting lags which include commercial automobile primary workers’ compensation other liability claimsmade and property business the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date for lines of business with long reporting lags which include other liability occurrence products liability excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider historically the company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags 

the key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the latest reported loss data current trends and other factors observed if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate the following table reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity relative to our assumptions on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2021 



our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 128 billion as of december 31 2021 relate to multiple accident years therefore the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above the impact of such changes would likely be manifested gradually over the course of many years as the magnitude of the changes became evident 

approximately 28 billion or 22 of the company’s net loss reserves as of december 31 2021 relate to the reinsurance  monoline excess segment there is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of excess workers compensation and assumed reinsurance loss reserves in the case of excess workers’ compensation our policies generally attach at 1 million or higher the claims which reach our layer therefore tend to involve the most serious injuries and many remain open for the lifetime of the claimant which extends the claim settlement tail these claims also occur less frequently but tend to be larger than primary claims which increases claim variability in the case of assumed reinsurance our loss reserve estimates are based in part upon information received from ceding companies if information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct the company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate furthermore due to 

delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is also extended management considers the impact of delayed reporting and the extended tail in its selection of loss development factors for these lines of business 

information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business this information which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies the company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the company the information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks 

following is a summary of the company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of december 31 2021 and 2020 

  



following is a summary of the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses by major line of business as of december 31 2021 and 2020 

  



 

1 reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business are net of an aggregate net discount of 452 million and 483 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

2 shorttail lines include commercial multiperil nonliability inland marine accident and health fidelity and surety boiler and machinery and other lines 

3 reinsurance  monoline excess includes property and casualty reinsurance as well as operations that solely retain risk on an excess basis 

the company evaluates reserves for losses and loss expenses on a quarterly basis changes in estimates of prior year losses are reported when such changes are made the changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends 

certain of the companys insurance and reinsurance contracts are retrospectively rated whereby the company collects more or less premiums based on the level of loss activity for those contracts changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years may be fully or partially offset by additional or return premiums 

net prior year development ie the sum of prior year reserve changes and prior year earned premiums changes for each of the last three years ended december 31 are as follows 



the covid19 global pandemic has impacted and may further impact the company’s results through its effect on claim frequency and severity loss cost trends have been impacted and may be further impacted by covid19related claims in certain lines of business losses incurred from covid19related claims have been offset to a certain extent by lower claim frequency in certain lines of our businesses however as the economy and legal systems have reopened the benefit of lower claim frequency has begun to abate although as populations have continued to be vaccinated against the virus and the effects of the pandemic have receded in many jurisdictions most particularly the united states it remains too early to determine the ultimate net impact of covid19 on the company new variants of the covid19 virus including the “omicron” variant and the slowing of vaccination rates among certain populations continue to create risks with respect to loss costs and the potential for renewed impact of the other effects of covid19 associated with economic conditions inflation and social distancing and work from home rules 

most of the covid19related claims reported to the company to date involve certain shorttailed lines of business including contingency and event cancellation business interruption and film production delay the company has also received covid19related claims for longertailed casualty lines of business such as workers’ compensation and other liability however the estimated incurred loss impact for these reported claims are not material at this time given the continuing uncertainty regarding the pandemics pervasiveness the future impact that the pandemic may have on claim frequency and severity remains uncertain at this time 

the company has estimated the potential covid19 impact to its contingency and event cancellation workers’ compensation and other lines of business under a number of possible scenarios however due to covid19’s continued evolving impact there remains a high degree of uncertainty around the company’s covid19 reserves in addition should the pandemic continue or worsen as a result of new covid19 variants or otherwise governments in the jurisdictions where we operate may renew their efforts to expand policy coverage terms beyond the policy’s intended coverage accordingly losses arising from these actions and the other factors described above could exceed the company’s reserves established for those related policies 

as of december 31 2021 the company had recognized losses for covid19related claims activity net of reinsurance of approximately 274 million of which 233 million relates to the insurance segment and 41 million relates to the reinsurance  monoline excess segment such 274 million of covid19related losses included 239 million of reported losses and 35 million of ibnr for the year ended december 31 2021 the company recognized current accident year losses for covid19related claims activity net of reinsurance of approximately 58 million of which 54 million relates to the insurance segment and 4 million relates to the reinsurance  monoline excess segment 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 7 million in 2021 

insurance – reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 20 million in 2021 net of additional and return premiums the overall favorable development in 2021 was attributable to favorable development on the 2020 accident year partially offset by adverse development on the 2016 through 2019 accident years 

the favorable development on the 2020 accident year was largely concentrated in the commercial auto liability and other liability lines of business including commercial multiperil liability during 2020 the company achieved larger rate increases in these lines of business than were contemplated in its budget and in its initial loss ratio selections the company also experienced significantly lower reported claim frequency in these lines in 2020 relative to historical averages and lower 

reported incurred losses relative to its expectations we believe that the lower claim frequency and lower reported incurred losses were caused by the impacts of the covid19 pandemic for example lockdowns reduced driving and traffic work from home and court closures however due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on accident year 2020 incurred losses the company elected not to react to these lower reported trends during 2020 as more information became available and the 2020 accident year continued to mature during 2021 the company started to recognize favorable accident year 2020 development in response to the continuing favorable reported loss experience relative to its expectations 

the adverse development on the 2016 through 2019 accident years is concentrated largely in the other liability line of business including commercial multiperil liability but is also seen to a lesser extent in commercial auto liability the adverse development for these accident years is driven by a higher than expected number of large losses reported and particularly impacted the directors and officers liability lawyers professional liability and excess and surplus lines casualty classes of business we also believe that increased social inflation is contributing to the increased number of large losses for example higher jury awards on cases which go to trial and the corresponding higher demands from plaintiffs and higher values required to reach settlement on cases which do not go to trial 

reinsurance  monoline excess – reserves for the reinsurance  monoline excess segment developed unfavorably by 13 million in 2021 the unfavorable development in the segment was driven by the nonproportional reinsurance assumed liability and other liability lines of business related primarily to accident years 2017 through 2019 and was partially offset by favorable development in excess workers’ compensation business which was spread across many prior accident years the unfavorable nonproportional reinsurance assumed liability and other liability development was associated with our us and uk assumed reinsurance business and related primarily to accounts insuring construction projects and professional liability exposures 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 16 million in 2020 

insurance  reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 24 million in 2020 net of additional and return premiums continuing the pattern seen in recent years the overall favorable development in 2020 resulted from more significant favorable development on workers’ compensation business which was partially offset by unfavorable development on professional liability including excess professional liability 

for workers’ compensation the favorable development was spread across almost all prior accident years including prior to 2011 but was most significant in accident years 2016 through 2019 the favorable workers’ compensation development reflects a continuation of the benign loss cost trends experienced during recent years particularly the favorable claim frequency trends ie number of reported claims per unit of exposure the long term trend of declining workers’ compensation frequency can be attributable to improved workplace safety loss severity trends were also aided by our continued investment in claims handling initiatives such as medical case management services and vendor savings through usage of preferred provider networks and pharmacy benefit managers reported workers’ compensation losses in 2020 continued to be below our expectations at most of our businesses and were below the assumptions underlying our initial loss ratio picks and our previous reserve estimates for most prior accident years 

for professional liability business unfavorable development was driven mainly by large losses reported in the directors and officers “do” lawyers professional and excess hospital professional liability lines of business for these lines of business we continue to see an increase in the number of large losses reported and a lengthening of the reporting “tail” beyond historical levels we believe a contributing cause is rising social inflation in the form of for example higher jury awards on cases that go to trial and the corresponding higher demands from plaintiffs and higher values required to reach settlement on cases that do not go to trial the unfavorable development for professional liability affected mainly accident years 2016 through 2018 

reinsurance  monoline excess – reserves for the reinsurance  monoline excess segment developed unfavorably by 8 million in 2020 the unfavorable development in the segment was driven by nonproportional assumed liability business written in both the us and uk and was partially offset by favorable development on excess workers’ compensation business the unfavorable nonproportional assumed liability development was concentrated in accident years 2014 through 2018 and related primarily to accounts insuring construction projects and professional liability exposures 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 19 million in 2019 

insurance  reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 21 million in 2019 net of additional and return premiums this overall favorable development resulted from more significant favorable development on workers’ compensation business which was partially offset by unfavorable development on professional liability and general liability business 

for workers’ compensation the favorable development was spread across many accident years including prior to 2010 but was most significant in accident years 2014 through 2018 and particularly 2017 and 2018 the favorable workers’ compensation development reflects a continuation during 2019 of the benign loss cost trends experienced during recent years particularly the favorable claim frequency trends ie number of reported claims per unit of exposure the long term trend of declining workers’ compensation frequency can be attributable to improved workplace safety loss severity trends were also aided by our continued investment in claims handling initiatives such as medical case management services and vendor savings through usage of preferred provider networks and pharmacy benefit managers our initial loss ratio “picks” for this line of business over the past few accident years have contemplated an increase in loss cost trends and reflect decreasing premium rates in the marketplace reported workers’ compensation losses in 2019 continued to be below our expectations at most of our 

operating units and were below the assumptions underlying our initial loss ratio picks and our previous reserve estimates 

for professional liability business the unfavorable development was driven mainly by an increase in the number of large losses reported in the lawyers professional liability and directors and officers “do” liability lines of business many of the lawyers large losses involved claims made against insured law firms relating to work performed on matters stemming from the 2008 financial crisis these claims affected mainly accident years 2013 through 2016 in addition for both of these lines of business we have seen evidence of social inflation in the form of higher jury awards on cases that go to trial and corresponding higher demands from plaintiffs and higher values required to reach settlement on cases that do not go to trial the unfavorable development for do affected mainly accident years 2014 through 2017 

for general liability business most of the unfavorable development emanated from our excess and surplus lines es businesses and was driven by an increase in the number of large losses reported many of these large losses were from construction and contracting classes of business which have also been impacted by social inflation the general liability unfavorable development impacted mainly accident years 2015 through 2018 

reinsurance  monoline excess  reserves for the reinsurance  monoline excess segment developed unfavorably by 2 million in 2019 the unfavorable development in the segment was driven by nonproportional assumed liability business in both the us and uk and was largely offset by favorable development on excess workers’ compensation business the unfavorable nonproportional assumed liability development was concentrated in accident years 2015 through 2018 and included an adjustment for the ogden discount rate in the uk 

reserve discount  the company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves the amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was 1387 million and 1655 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the aggregate net discount for those reserves after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 452 million and 483 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively at december 31 2021 discount rates by year ranged from 07 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 34 

substantially all discounted workers’ compensation reserves 97 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2021 are excess workers’ compensation reserves in order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period once established no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized the expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the company’s loss payout experience 

the company also discounts reserves for certain other longduration workers’ compensation reserves representing approximately 3 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2021 including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease these reserves are discounted at statutory rates prescribed or permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 

assumed reinsurance premiums  the company estimates the amount of assumed reinsurance premiums that it will receive under treaty reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contracts these premium estimates are revised as the actual amount of assumed premiums is reported to the company by the ceding companies as estimates of assumed premiums are made or revised the related amount of earned premiums commissions and incurred losses associated with those premiums are recorded estimated assumed premiums receivable were approximately 60 million and 44 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the assumed premium estimates are based upon terms set forth in reinsurance agreements information received from ceding companies during the underwriting and negotiation of agreements reports received from ceding companies and discussions and correspondence with reinsurance intermediaries the company also considers its own view of market conditions economic trends and experience with similar lines of business these premium estimates represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate amount of premiums to be received under its assumed reinsurance agreements

fair value measurements  the company’s fixed maturity available for sale securities equity securities and its trading account securities are carried at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or 

paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available the fair value of the vast majority of the company’s portfolio is based on observable data other than quoted prices and accordingly is classified as level 2 

in classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy the company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable the company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information the company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers the uninterrupted availability of such inputs the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time if the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable the security is categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers and reference data quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions for publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable the company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data for securities traded only in private negotiations the company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer financial data projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk  the fair value of the company’s investments is subject to risks of fluctuations in credit quality and interest rates the company uses various models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage interest rate risk the company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate relationship between the effective duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities ie policy claims and debt obligations the effective duration for the fixed maturity portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was 24 years at both december 31 2021 and 2020 

in addition the fair value of the company’s international investments is subject to currency risk the company attempts to manage its currency risk by matching its foreign currency assets and liabilities where considered appropriate 

the following table outlines the groups of fixed maturity securities and their effective duration at december 31 2021 



duration is a common measure of the price sensitivity of fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates the company determines the estimated change in fair value of the fixed maturity securities assuming parallel shifts in the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static the estimated fair value at specified levels at december 31 2021 would be as follows 



arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less the company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies including short sales 

additionally the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options selling call options or entering into swap contracts the companys merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks

loss and loss expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among others historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made although the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

the company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves the amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was 1655 million and 1731 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the aggregate net discount for those reserves after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 483 million and 530 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively at december 31 2020 discount rates by year ranged from 07 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 36 

substantially all discounted workers’ compensation reserves 97 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2020 are excess workers’ compensation reserves in order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period once established no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized the expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the company’s loss payout experience 

the company also discounts reserves for certain other longduration workers’ compensation reserves representing approximately 3 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2020 including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease these reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 

to date known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the company’s operations because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to significant environmental or asbestos exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language 

the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses relating to environmental and asbestos claims on policies written before adoption of the absolute exclusion was 19 million at december 31 2020 and 24 million at december 31 2019 the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years 



 

1 the cumulative effect adjustment resulting from changes in accounting principals relates to the allowance for expected credit losses on reinsurance recoverables that commenced on january 1 2020 due to the adoption of asu 201613 see note 1 for more details 

2 claims occurring during the current year are net of loss reserve discounts of 10 million 20 million and 24 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

3 the change in estimates for claims occurring in prior years is net of loss reserve discount on an undiscounted basis the estimates for claims occurring in prior years decreased by 21 million in 2020 and increased by 19 million in 2019 and decreased by 4 million in 2018 respectively 

4 for certain retrospectively rated insurance policies and reinsurance agreements changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years are offset by additional or return premiums 

  

also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 13 reserves for losses and loss expenses included in our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the changes in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2020 as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” in the company’s us regulatory filings is as follows 



 

1 for statutory purposes the company discounts its workers’ compensation reinsurance reserves at 25 as prescribed or permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware in its gaap financial statements the company discounts excess workers’ compensation reserves at the riskfree rate and assumed workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate 

reinsurance 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

us regulation   

our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 

overview  our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums loss expenses and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance 

subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

legislative and regulatory activity related to the covid19 pandemic since march 2020 us state insurance regulators have issued directives and guidance in response to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic which have encouraged or directed insurance companies to implement accommodations such as extending grace periods for premium payments and forbearing on the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies due to nonpayment of premium in addition there has been industry and regulatory discussion regarding the appropriate role of pandemic business interruption coverage which could potentially mandate retroactive coverage of pandemicrelated business interruption losses that insurance policies would not otherwise cover and were not priced to cover such losses in december 2020 the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” expressed its view that a federal mechanism is necessary to address the business interruption coverage gap for pandemic risk proposals for a prospective federal backstop for pandemic business interruption coverages are currently under development and consideration these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our business 

see “risk factors — risks related to our industry — the covid19 pandemic has materially and adversely affected our results of operations and is expected to continue and therefore may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and liquidity” 

holding company statutes  in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations 

in addition we must annually submit to our lead state regulator an “enterprise risk management report” which identifies the activities and circumstances of any affiliated company that might have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our group or our us licensed insurers 

nearly all states have also adopted changes to the holding company act that authorize us insurance regulators to lead or participate in the groupwide supervision of certain international insurance groups in november 2019 the international association of insurance supervisors “iais” an international standard setter adopted a global framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups as discussed below under “ international regulation” this framework includes a riskbased groupwide global insurance capital standard “ics” which will undergo a fiveyear monitoring period that started in january 2020 in the us the naic has developed a group capital calculation tool that uses a riskbased capital aggregation methodology for all entities in an insurance holding company system the goal is to provide us regulators with a method to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of each entity in a group in a way that applies to all companies regardless of their structure the naic adopted the group capital calculation methodology and amendments to the naic’s model holding company act and regulation these amendments which implement the annual filing requirement for the group capital calculation now have to be adopted by state legislatures in order to become effective 

nearly all states have adopted the naics risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act the “orsa model act” which requires an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an own risk and solvency assessment summary report “orsa” the orsa is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks under orsa we are required to 

• regularly no less than annually conduct an orsa to assess the adequacy of our risk management framework and current and estimated projected future solvency position 

• internally document the process and results of the assessment and 

• provide a confidential highlevel orsa summary report annually to the commissioner of insurance of the state of delaware our lead state commissioner 

cybersecurity regulations new york’s cybersecurity regulation for financial services institutions that are authorized by the new york state department of financial services part 500 including our insurance subsidiaries licensed in new york became effective on march 1 2017 the regulation requires these entities to assess risks associated with their information systems and establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers’ private data and the confidentiality integrity and availability of the licensee’s information systems on october 24 2017 the naic adopted the insurance data security model law the “cybersecurity model law” which establishes standards for data security the investigation of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to or the misuse of certain nonpublic information and reporting to insurance commissioners the cybersecurity model law imposes significant regulatory burdens intended to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of information systems its implementation will be based on adoption by state 

legislatures as of december 31 2020 the cybersecurity model law had been adopted by 11 states including one of our domiciliary states importantly a drafting note in the cybersecurity model law states that a licensee’s compliance with the new york cybersecurity regulation is intended to constitute compliance with the cybersecurity model law 

certain states are developing or have developed regulations related to privacy and data security for example in 2018 california enacted the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which broadly regulates the collection processing and disclosure of california residents’ personal information imposes limits on the “sale” of personal information and grants california residents certain rights to among other things access and delete data about them in certain circumstances ccpa also established a private right of action with potentially significant statutory damages whereby businesses that fail to implement reasonable security measures to protect against breaches of personal information could be liable to affected consumers ccpa became effective on january 1 2020 and compliance with the ccpa may increase the cost of providing our services in california other states have considered  and may adopt  similar proposals we cannot predict the impact if any that any proposed or future cybersecurity regulations will have on our business financial condition or results of operations 

riskbased capital requirements  the naic utilizes a riskbased capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the naic rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any rbc action level as of december 31 2020 

insurance regulatory information system the naic also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios for property and casualty insurers referred to as the insurance regulatory information system “iris” on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 

guaranty funds  our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and the insolvent companys available funds are insufficient to pay policyholders and claimants the amounts to which they are entitled the protection afforded under a states guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums in that state the naic postassessment property and liability insurance guaranty association model act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

additionally state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory propertyliability “shared market” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “fair” plans in addition some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 

dividends  we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

trade practices  state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers including provisions governing marketing and sales practices policyholder services claims management and complaint handling state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 

investment regulation investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind quality and concentration of investments in general these laws and regulations permit investments in federal state and municipal obligations corporate bonds preferred and common equity securities mortgage loans real estate and certain other investments subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications investments that do 

not comply with these limits and qualifications are deducted in our insurance subsidiaries calculation of their statutory capital and surplus 

terrorism risk insurance the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism pursuant to the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2019 “tripra” the program was extended until december 31 2027 

tripra provides a federal backstop to all us based property and casualty insurers for insurance related losses resulting from any act of terrorism on us soil or against certain us air carriers vessels or foreign missions tripra is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism tripras definition of certified acts includes domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tripra when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism 

under the program the federal government will pay 80 of an insurers covered losses in excess of the insurers applicable deductible the insurers deductible is based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2020 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2021 will be approximately 1014 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 200 million industrywide for any calendar year after 2020 tripra limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

excess and surplus lines  the regulation of our us subsidiaries excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business principally with respect to rates and policy forms strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 

climate change and financial risks  in september 2020 the new york state department of financial services the “nydfs” issued a circular letter to new york domestic and foreign insurance companies which impacts our insurance subsidiaries licensed in new york the circular letter states that the nydfs expects insurers to integrate financial risks related to climate change into their governance frameworks risk management processes and business strategies for example the letter states that an insurer should designate a board member or board committee as well as a senior management function that oversees the management of the financial risks associated with climate change the nydfs will publish guidance on climaterelated financial supervision and it will incorporate questions on this topic into their examinations starting in 2021 

federal regulation although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act created two new federal government bodies the federal insurance office the “fio” and the financial stability oversight council the “fsoc” which may impact the regulation of insurance although the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements it does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance the fio has authority to represent the united states in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the us insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk in may 2018 the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act “economic growth act” was signed into law among other things the economic growth act addresses the roles played by federal regulators at international insurance standardsetting forums it directs the director of the fio and the board of governors of the federal reserve to support increased transparency at international standardsetting regulatory forums eg the iais these federal regulations also instruct the fio and the federal reserve to achieve consensus positions with the states through the naic prior to taking a position on any insurance proposal by a global insurance regulatory forum 

the doddfrank act authorizes the secretary of the treasury and us trade representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance and in september 2017 the us and the european union eu signed such a covered agreement the eu covered agreement 

the eu covered agreement addresses three areas of prudential supervision reinsurance group supervision and the exchange of information between the us and eu under the eu covered agreement reinsurance collateral requirements will no longer apply to qualifying eu reinsurers that sell reinsurance to the us market and us reinsurers operating in the eu 

market will no longer be subject to “local presence” requirements the eu covered agreement establishes group supervision practices that apply only to us and eu insurance groups operating in both territories for instance the eu covered agreement states that provided the us has adopted group supervision including worldwide group governance solvency capital and reporting usheadquartered insurance groups with operations in the eu will be supervised at the worldwide level only by us insurance regulators precluding eu insurance supervisors from exercising solvency and capital requirements over the worldwide operations of usheadquartered insurers under the doddfrank act the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with the eu covered agreement 

in late december 2018 the us department of the treasury and the office of the us trade representative entered into a covered agreement with the uk the “uk covered agreement” which will extend the benefits of a covered agreement to the uk after brexit the agreement between the us and the uk largely reflects the provisions of the eu covered agreement and incorporates the same timeframes within it 

under the terms of such eu and uk covered agreements beginning september 1 2022 state credit for reinsurance laws that result in nonus reinsurers subject to the covered agreements being treated less favorably than us reinsurers may be preempted by the applicable covered agreement accordingly in june 2019 the naic adopted amendments to its credit for reinsurance model law in order to satisfy the substantive and timing requirements of the covered agreements and to pave the way for us states to similarly amend their credit for reinsurance laws and avoid potential federal preemption of these laws these amendments will become an naic accreditation standard beginning september 1 2022 with enforcement beginning on january 1 2023 the newly amended credit for reinsurance model law also extends the zero reinsurance collateral provisions in the covered agreements to us jurisdictions that are accredited by the naic and to nonus jurisdictions that have not entered into a covered agreement with the us but the naic has identified as “reciprocal jurisdictions” pursuant to the naic qualified jurisdiction process we cannot currently predict the impact of these changes to the law or whether any other covered agreements will be successfully adopted and cannot currently estimate the impact of these changes to the law and any such adopted covered agreements on our business financial condition or operating results 

the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states’ financial stability in the event of the insurer’s material financial distress or failure ie a “systemically important financial institution” or a “nonbank sifi” an insurer so designated by the fsoc will be subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards there are currently no such nonbank sifis designated by the fsoc on december 4 2019 the fsoc approved final guidance related to a revised process for designating nonbank sifis which substantially changed its previous procedures by adopting an activitiesbased approach and moving away from the entitiesbased approach the final guidance became effective on january 29 2020 

based upon our current business model and balance sheet we do not believe that we will be designated by the fsoc as such an institution although the potential impact of any future amendments to the doddfrank act on the us insurance industry is not clear our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically important nonbank financial companies 

international regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by the prudential regulation authority “pra” andor the financial conduct authority “fca” the pra’s primary objectives with regard to insurers are to promote the safety and soundness of insurers and to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for current and future policyholders while the fca has three operational objectives i to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers ii to protect and enhance the integrity of the united kingdom’s financial system and iii to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the financial services markets the pra and fca employ a variety of regulatory tools to achieve their objectives including periodic auditing and reporting requirements risk assessment reviews minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements dividend restrictions in certain cases approval requirements governing the appointment of key officers approval requirements governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements 

our lloyd’s managing agency is also regulated by lloyd’s and the lloyd’s syndicate business is subject to lloyd’s supervision through lloyd’s we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of lloyd’s international licenses in each such country we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country our insurance subsidiary based in liechtenstein is regulated by the financial market authority of liechtenstein which has regulatory tools analogous to those of the uk regulators noted above 

additionally uk and liechtenstein laws and regulations also impact us as “controllers” of our europeanregulated subsidiaries whereby we are required to notify the appropriate authorities about significant events relating to such regulated subsidiaries’ controllers ie persons or entities which have certain levels of direct or indirect voting power or economic interests in the regulated entities as well as changes of control and to submit annual reports regarding their controllers the 

prafca’s senior managers and certification regime and analogous regulation in liechtenstein further provide regulatory frameworks for standards of fitness and propriety conduct and accountability for individuals in positions of responsibility at insurers in addition certain employees are individually registered at lloyd’s 

following the expiry of the transition period for the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu on december 31 2020 an insurance company with authorization to write insurance business in the uk is no longer permitted to provide crossborder services on a “passporting” basis in the remaining member states of the european economic area “eea” a group including member states of the eu and norway liechtenstein and iceland instead uk insurance companies are now required to establish either a subsidiary or a branch in an eea member state and apply for direct authorization with the local regulator in that jurisdiction 

eea insurers have similarly lost their right to provide crossborder services on a “passporting” basis into the uk as a result the uk branch of our liechtenstein subsidiary has applied for direct authorization to carry on insurance business in the uk in the meantime the branch is currently able to perform regulated insurance business in the uk under the supervision of the prafca pursuant to the uk ‘temporary permissions regime’ while the application is being considered 

see below “risks relating to our businessthe united kingdom leaving the eu could adversely affect our business” for more information 

our insurance business throughout the eu and eea is subject to “solvency ii” an insurance regulatory regime governing among other things capital adequacy and risk management which became effective on january 1 2016 following the uk’s withdrawal from the eu and the expiry of the transition period on december 31 2020 our lloyd’s managing agency and the uk branch of our liechtenstein subsidiary are now subject to a separate uk prudential regime this domestic regime is identical to solvency ii from january 1 2021 however the two regimes may diverge over time the uk is currently undertaking a review of solvency ii and of the regulatory regime applicable to uk authorized insurers and reinsurers lloyd’s applies a capital adequacy test to all lloyd’s syndicates including our syndicate that is based on the uk prudential regime 

solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency under solvency ii it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii currently the us system of insurance regulation relating to group supervision is not deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii by european union authorities the pra will also perform separate but comparable supervision of group solvency under the uk’s own domestic prudential regime where a us holding company is a parent of a subsidiary uk insurer or reinsurer 

the liechtenstein financial services regulator the financial markets authority is the group supervisor for our europeanregulated subsidiaries however both the eu and the uk covered agreements prohibit any eu supervisor or the pra as applicable from exercising groupwide supervision at any level above the highest company organized in the country of that supervisor 

we must also comply with the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” which took effect in may 2018 the regulation’s goal is to impose increased individual rights and protections for all personal data located in or originating from the eu the uk has also implemented the gdpr both the gdpr and the uk gdpr are extraterritorial in that they apply to all businesses in the eu and the uk respectively and any business outside the eu and the uk that process eu andor uk personal data of individuals in the eu andor the uk moreover there are significant fines associated with noncompliance in particular we need to monitor our compliance with all relevant member states’ laws and regulations including where permitted derogations from the gdpr and the uk gdpr are introduced the introduction of the gdpr and the uk gdpr and any resultant changes in eu member states’ or uk national laws and regulations has increased our compliance obligations and has necessitated the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data and has required us to change our business practices regarding these matters 

in addition we may be affected by regulatory policies adopted by the iais an international standard setter consisting of supervisors and regulators from more than 200 jurisdictions the iais has been working on several initiatives to consider changes to insurer solvency standards and group supervision of companies in a holding company system in response to the increasing globalization of the insurance sector in november 2019 the iais formally adopted a global framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups “iaigs” which is referred to as the common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups or “comframe” comframe is intended to provide a framework of basic standards for iaigs and a process for supervisors to cooperate in the supervision of iaigs also in november 2019 the iais adopted a riskbased groupwide global insurance capital standard “ics” that will apply to iaigs and ultimately form a part of comframe the ics commenced a fiveyear monitoring period in january 2020 which is being used for confidential reporting and discussion in supervisory colleges to provide feedback to the iais on the ics’s design and performance but will not trigger any supervisory action following this monitoring period the ics is expected to be implemented in 2025 as a group 

wide prescribed capital requirement for iaigs and integrated into the rest of comframe as noted above under “ us regulation” it is unclear how the development of the ics will interact with existing capital requirements for insurance companies in the united states and the naic’s development of the gcc 

our international operations are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in mexico australia and canada and in certain other countries in europe south america and southeast asia generally our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements while each country imposes licensing solvency auditing and financial reporting requirements the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially key areas where country regulations may differ include i the type of financial reports to be filed ii a requirement to use local intermediaries iii the amount of reinsurance permissible iv the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates and v the type and frequency of regulatory examinations 

competition   

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with many insurance companies of various sizes as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as selfinsured retentions or captive programs transacting business in the united states and internationally we compete directly with a large number of these companies competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our operating units can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our operating units establish their own pricing practices based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit 

competition for insurance business within the united states comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers our specialty operating units compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers other regional units compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers additionally direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional units by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company we compete internationally with native insurance operations both large and small which in some cases are related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

competition for reinsurance business which is especially strong comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance partner re and others 

in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively 

human capital resources

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below occur our businesses results of operations andor financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in addition to those described below our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

risks relating to our industry   

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties in demand and pricing causing cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business in recent years we have faced significant competition in our business as a result of new entrants and capital providers as well as existing insurers seeking to gain or maintain market share recently premium rates have increased at an accelerating pace for most lines of business while they have decreased in others most notably workers compensation the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic or social inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return have impacted rate adequacy with interest rates remaining at or near historic lows these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which have pressured premium rates in certain areas and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume in some parts of our business   

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies diversified financial services companies and insurtech companies competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided including ease of doing business over the internet speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written in recent years the insurance industry has undergone consolidation which may further increase competition in some parts of our business 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial andor marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance market include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers 

over the past several years increased supply has led to significant competition in our business our es operating units have also encountered competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share more recently insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business excluding workers compensation however loss costs have also increased and the duration and magnitude of the improving pricing environment remains uncertain with the low level of interest rates available current price levels for certain lines of business may remain below the prices required for us to achieve our longterm return objectives we expect to continue to face strong competition in some parts of our business 

in recent years various types of investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital or access to thirdparty capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively in addition technology companies or other third parties have created and may in the future create technologyenabled business models processes platforms or alternate distribution channels that may adversely impact our competitive position in some parts of our business 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves   

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 138 billion as of december 31 2020 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on managements assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions both inflation overall and medical cost inflation which has historically been greater than inflation overall can have an adverse impact 

reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain   

as industry practices and economic legal judicial social and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include but are not limited to 

• judicial expansion of policy coverage and a greater propensity to grant claimants more favorable amounts and the impact of new theories of liability 

• plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers including us in purported class action litigation relating to claimshandling and other practices 

• social inflation trends including higher and more frequent claims more favorable judgments and legislated increases 

• medical developments that link health issues to particular causes resulting in liability claims 

• claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies including cyber security related risks 

• claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions and 

• increased claims due to third party funding of litigation 

in some instances these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies as a result the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued 

in addition the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue to remove limitations on recovery to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business 

the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes   

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results for 

example catastrophe losses net of reinsurance recoveries were 340 million in 2020 including covid19 related losses 90 million in 2019 and 105 million in 2018 similarly manmade catastrophes can also have a material impact on our financial results 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes tsunamis hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires pandemics as well as terrorist and other manmade activities including drilling mining and other industrial accidents cyber events or terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic has materially and adversely affected our results of operations and is expected to continue and therefore may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and liquidity 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic including the related impact on the us and global economies has materially and adversely affected our results of operations we expect the pandemic and its impact on our business to continue and potentially even worsen but we cannot predict the magnitude or duration of its continued impact particularly given the great uncertainties associated with covid19 including regarding the reopening of the us and global economies and the recovery from its devastating economic and other effects the ultimate impact of covid19 on our results of operations financial position and liquidity is not yet known and likely will not be known for some time but includes the following 

adverse legislative and regulatory action legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to covid19 may adversely affect us particularly in our workers’ compensation and property coverages businesses for example our business may be subject to certain initiatives including but not limited to legislative and regulatory action that seeks to retroactively mandate coverage for losses that our insurance policies would not otherwise cover and which were not priced to cover legislative and regulatory action providing for shifting presumptions with respect to the burdens of proof for “essential” workers on workers’ compensation coverages and varying definitions of “essential” workers actions prohibiting us from cancelling insurance policies in accordance with our policy terms or nonrenewing policies at their natural expiration andor orders to provide premium refunds grant extended grace periods for premium payments and provide extended time to pay past due premiums any such action would likely increase both our underwriting losses and our expenses and any legal challenges to any such action could take years to resolve 

claim losses related to covid19 may exceed reserves  as of december 31 2020 we recorded approximately 171 million for covid19related losses net of applicable reinsurance and reinstatement premiums of approximately 18 million of the 171 million of covid19related losses 95 million are reported losses and 76 million is booked as ibnr our reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown given the great uncertainties associated with covid19 and its impact and the limited information upon which our current assumptions and assessments have been made our reserves and the underlying estimated level of claim losses and costs arising from covid19 may materially change 

claim losses and adjustment expenses may increase  as the effects of covid19 on industry practices and economic legal judicial social and other environmental conditions occur unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverages may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent including in the area of property coverages where physical damage requirements and communicable disease exclusions are currently being challenged or by increasing the number andor size of claims each of which could adversely impact our results 

reinsurance  we purchase reinsurance in order to transfer part of the risk that we have assumed by writing insurance policies to reinsurance companies in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with assuming such risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred to the reinsurer it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders there may be uncertainty surrounding the availability of reinsurance coverage for covid19related losses as our reinsurers may dispute the applicability of reinsurance to such losses including the application of reinsurance reinstatements and as a result our reinsurers may refuse to pay reinsurance recoverables related thereto or they may not pay them on a timely basis in addition we may be unable to renew our current reinsurance coverages 

or obtain appropriate new reinsurance covers with respect to certain exposures under our policies including covid19related exposures and therefore our net exposures could increase or if we are unwilling to bear such increase in net exposure we may reduce our level of underwriting commitments 

premium volumes may be negatively impacted  the demand for insurance is significantly influenced by general economic conditions consequently reduced economic activity relating to the covid19 pandemic is likely to decrease demand for our insurance products and services and negatively impact our premium volumes and in certain cases may result in return of premiums due to a decrease in exposures this may continue for an indefinite period with the magnitude of the impact impossible to predict in addition as we continue to evaluate the effects of covid19 on the insurance coverages we currently offer our appetite for providing certain coverages in various jurisdictions may change which could further negatively impact our premium volumes any such reduction in our premiums would likely cause our expense ratio to rise 

investments  further disruptions in global financial markets due to the continuing impact of covid19 could cause us to incur additional unrealized andor realized investment losses beyond the investment fund losses incurred to date including impairments in our fixed maturity portfolio and other investments in addition the economic uncertainty resulting from covid19 may result in a further decline in interest rates which may negatively impact our net investment income from future investment activity 

credit risk  as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face greater credit risk from our policyholders independent agents and brokers in connection with the payment and remittance of premiums as a result of the economic conditions caused by covid19 similarly our credit risk related to the reimbursement of deductibles from policyholders and in connection with reinsurance recoverables has increased 

operational disruptions and costs  our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management or a significant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our agents brokers suppliers or other third party service providers are unable to continue to work because of illness government directives or otherwise in addition our agents brokers suppliers and other third party service providers which we rely on for key aspects of our operations are subject to risks and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic which may interfere with their ability to fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreedupon terms in response to the covid19 pandemic we have implemented remote working policies which have resulted in disruptions to our business routines heightened risk to cybersecurity attacks and data security incidents and a greater dependency on internet and telecommunication access and capabilities 

changing climate conditions may alter the frequency and increase the severity of catastrophic events and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results 

over the past several years changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming appear to have contributed to the unpredictability frequency and severity of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures there is a growing scientific consensus that global warming and other climate change are altering the frequency severity andor peril characteristics of catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes windstorms floods and other natural disasters such changes make it more difficult for us to predict and model catastrophic events reducing our ability to accurately price our exposure to such events and mitigate our risks any increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters may adversely affect our financial condition and results 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts   

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2019 “tripra” for up to 80 of our covered losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2020 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2021 is approximately 1014 million in addition the coverage provided under tripra does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business   

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered in the united states by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

• standards of solvency including riskbased capital measurements 

• restrictions on the nature quality and concentration of investments 

• requirements pertaining to certain methods of accounting 

• evaluating enterprise risk to an insurer 

• rate and form regulation pertaining to certain of our insurance businesses 

• potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired insolvent or failed insurance companies and 

• involvement in the payment or adjudication of catastrophe or other claims beyond the terms of the policies 

state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters our insurance business internationally is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations outside the united states 

federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to conditions in the financial markets global insurance supervision and other factors may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 

the doddfrank act effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant nonbank financial companies including insurance companies be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve the doddfrank act also established a federal insurance office “fio” which is authorized to study monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure our business could be affected by changes whether as a result of potential changes to the doddfrank act to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

although state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in the united states in addition to the changes brought about by the doddfrank act congress has considered various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter and repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarranferguson act we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution in addition the change in the us administration and the volatile political environment may increase the chance of other federal legislative and regulatory changes that could affect us in ways we cannot predict 

with respect to international measures solvency ii the eu regime concerning the capital adequacy risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers may affect our insurance businesses implementation of solvency ii in eu member states occurred on january 1 2016 and as the solvency ii regime evolves over time we may be required to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance in particular the european commission and european regulators are undertaking a review of solvency ii which is anticipated to be completed in the third quarter of 2021 in addition despite the waiver of the solvency ii group capital requirements we received solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers additionally our capital requirements and compliance requirements may be adversely affected if the eu commission does not deem the insurance regulatory regimes of the jurisdictions outside the eu in which we have insurance or reinsurance companies domiciled to be “equivalent” to solvency ii 

similarly following the uk’s withdrawal from the eu and the expiry of the transition period on december 31 2020 our uk subsidiaries are now subject to a separate uk prudential regime to which the same considerations will apply the uk’s domestic prudential regime is currently identical to solvency ii although the two regimes and their respective requirements may diverge over time the uk has already declared that it considers the solvency ii regime as “equivalent” to its own however the eu is still determining whether to make “equivalency” declarations in respect of the uk’s prudential regime it is also possible that any “equivalency” determinations made by either side could be withdrawn in the future which would adversely affect our capital and compliance requirements 

if our compliance with solvency ii the uk’s prudential regime or any other regulatory regime is challenged we may be subject to monetary or other penalties in addition in order to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements or as a result of any investigation including remediation efforts we could be required to incur significant expenses and undertake additional work which in turn may divert resources from our business 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide 

variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may further restrict the conduct of our business 

risks relating to our business 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america canada mexico scandinavia the asiapacific region south africa and australia expose us to increased investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our investments in nonusdenominated assets are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

the united kingdom leaving the eu could adversely affect our business 

in accordance with the withdrawal agreement implementing the uk leaving the eu “brexit” the uk formally left the eu on january 31 2020 the agreement provided for a transitional period which ended on december 31 2020 during which time the uk continued to enjoy the same rights and obligations as it had as a member state though without participating in the eu institutions during the transitional period the uk and the eu negotiated a longterm agreement covering among other things the terms of trade between them culminating in the execution of the entry into a “trade and cooperation agreement” 

however notwithstanding the finalization of the trade and cooperation agreement between the uk and the eu uncertainty remains regarding the impact of brexit including the implementation and enforcement of terms and conditions of the agreement and the uk’s future relationship with the eu brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and differing laws and regulations between the uk and the eu specifically in relation to financial services under the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement both eu and uk insurers lost their respective passporting rights from january 1 2021 and it is unclear whether the eu will make “equivalence” determinations in respect of relevant aspects of uk financial services regulation as a result the uk branch of our liechtenstein subsidiary has applied to be directly authorized to perform insurance business in the uk which application remains under consideration 

more generally barriers to trade resulting from brexit could affect the attractiveness of the uk and impact our uk business we also face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences related to brexit including with respect to volatility in financial markets exchange rates and interest rates these uncertainties could increase the volatility of or reduce our investment results in particular periods or over time brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies 

any of these potential effects and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our president and ceo executive chairman senior executive officers presidents of our operating units experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new products and markets 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses   

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay 

such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2020 the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 2425 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk certain of these amounts are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

we are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders independent agents and brokers 

in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business including credit risk relating to policyholders independent agents and brokers for example our policyholders independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds 

as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn while we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms our efforts may not be successful for example to reduce such credit risk we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us in cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged andor the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit 

we are rated by am best standard  poors moodys and fitch and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poors moodys and fitch our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poors moodys or fitch our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a ratings downgrade could also adversely limit our access to capital markets which may increase the cost of debt a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

if conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable which may result from disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so on terms acceptable to us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to 

possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience difficulties with our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems our ability to conduct our business could be negatively or severely impacted   

our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe terrorist attack or industrial accident or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if our business continuity plans or system security does not sufficiently address such a business interruption system failure or service denial our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed 

failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability  

our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks computer viruses hackers employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches our electronic transmission of personal confidential and proprietary information to third parties with whom we have business relationships and our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security while we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these thirdparty vendors and others with whom we do business our vendors and third parties could still suffer data breaches that could result in the exposure of sensitive data and the infiltration of our computer systems our failure to effectively protect sensitive personal and our proprietary information whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors could result in significant monetary and reputational damages costly litigation or other regulatory enforcement actions these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs as a result our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective   

our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting claim processing and investment activities many of which are highly complex these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies as well as legal and regulatory standards including those related to privacy anticorruption antibribery and global finance and insurance matters our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance that the control systems objectives will be met if our controls are not effective it could lead to financial loss unanticipated risk exposure including underwriting credit and investment risk or damage to our reputation 

we could be adversely affected by recent and future changes in us federal income tax laws 

tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 fundamentally overhauled the us tax system by among other significant changes reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 in the context of the taxation of us propertycasualty insurance companies such as the company the act also modifies the loss reserve discounting rules and the proration rules that apply to reduce reserve deductions to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate it is possible that other legislation could be introduced and enacted by the current congress or future congresses that could have an adverse impact on us new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying provisions of the act may be forthcoming we cannot predict if when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect or their potential impact on us 

risks relating to our investments   

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations   

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2020 our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 142 billion or 679 of our total investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 43 state and municipal securities 260 corporate securities 329 assetbacked securities 226 mortgagebacked securities 73 and foreign government 69 

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise if significant inflation or an increase in interest rates were to occur the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would be negatively impacted conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations additionally given the low interest rate environment we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals 

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession during periods of market disruption it may be difficult to value certain of our securities particularly if trading becomes less frequent andor market data becomes less observable there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the then current financial environment in such cases more securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment 

although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue many states and municipalities operate under deficits or projected deficits the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuers ability to perform its obligations thereunder additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the continued low inflation actions by the federal reserve economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we have invested a portion of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets which are subject to significant volatility and may decline in value 

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets at december 31 2020 our investment in these assets was approximately 43 billion or 206 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents 

merger and arbitrage trading securities were 3415 million or 16 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2020 merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

real estate related investments including directly owned investment funds and loans receivable were 23 billion or 111 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2020 we also invest in real estate financial services energy transportation and other investment funds the values of these investments are subject to fluctuation based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and the related asset valuations in particular in addition our investments in real estate related assets and other alternative investments are less liquid than our other investments 

these investments are subject to significant volatility as a result of the conditions in the financial and commodity markets and the global economy 

risks relating to limitations on dividends from subsidiaries and antitakeover provisions 

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts 

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries during 2021 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 721 million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations pay dividends or repurchase shares 

laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable and may restrict a stockholders ability to purchase our common stock 

generally united states insurance holding company laws require that before a person can acquire control of an insurance company prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is domiciled pursuant to applicable laws and regulations “control” over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person directly or indirectly owns controls holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 or more of the voting securities of that insurer or any parent company of such insurer indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock thus the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled are likely to apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common stock some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates on the one hand and the target insurer and its affiliates on the other hand have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state additionally many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements 

these provisions can also lead to the imposition of conditions on an acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 

certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 

these provisions include 

• our classified board of directors and the ability of our board to increase its size and to appoint directors to fill newly created directorships 

• the requirement that 80 of our stockholders must approve mergers and other transactions between us and the holder of 5 or more of our shares unless the transaction was approved by our board of directors prior to such holders acquisition of 5 of our shares and 

• the need for advance notice in order to raise business or make nominations at stockholders meetings 

these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

w r berkley corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the united states and operates worldwide in two business segments of the property and casualty business insurance and reinsurance  monoline excess our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches it also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics while providing our business units with certain operating autonomy our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital investment reinsurance and enterprise risk management and actuarial financial and corporate legal staff support the companys primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments 

an important part of our strategy is to form new operating units to capitalize on various business opportunities over the years the company has formed numerous new operating units that are focused on important parts of the economy in the us including healthcare cyber security energy and agriculture and on growing international markets including the asiapacific region south america and mexico 

the profitability of the company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time an insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural and other disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic or social inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses general insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity ie the level of capital employed in the industry and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital 

the company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income and investment gains the company’s invested assets are invested principally in fixed maturity securities the return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities returns available on fixed maturity investments have been at low levels for an extended period 

the company also invests in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets the companys investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced and the company expects to continue to experience greater fluctuations in investment income the companys share of the earnings or losses from investment funds is generally reported on a onequarter lag in order to facilitate the timely completion of the companys consolidated financial statements 

effective january 1 2020 the company adopted new accounting standard asu 201613 financial instruments  credit losses refer to note 1 in the financial statements for further information on the accounting guidance and impact of its adoption on the companys results and financial position 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic including the related impact on the us and global economies has materially and adversely affected our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 the company recorded approximately 171 million for covid19related losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums of approximately 18 million the ultimate impact of covid19 on the economy and on the company’s results of operations financial position and liquidity is uncertain and not within the company’s control the scope duration and magnitude of the direct and indirect effects of covid19 continue to evolve in ways that are difficult or impossible to anticipate despite the effects of covid19 to date the company’s financial position and liquidity improved commencing in the second quarter 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our results of operations financial position and liquidity is expected to include among others 

adverse legislative and regulatory action legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or that may be taken in response to covid19 such as those that seek to retroactively mandate or provide a presumption of coverage for losses which our insurance policies would not otherwise cover and were not priced to cover may adversely affect us particularly in our workers’ compensation and property coverages businesses 

claim losses related to covid19 may exceed reserves given the great uncertainties associated with covid19 and its impact and the limited information upon which our current assumptions and assessments have been made our reserves and underlying estimated level of claim losses and costs arising from covid19 may materially change 

claim losses and adjustment expenses may increase as the effects of covid19 on industry practices and economic legal judicial social and other environmental conditions continue to evolve unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverages may emerge including in the area of property coverages where physical damage requirements and communicable disease exclusions are currently being challenged 

reinsurance reinsurers may dispute the applicability of reinsurance to covid19 related losses including the application of reinsurance reinstatements and as a result our reinsurers may refuse to pay reinsurance recoverables related thereto or they may not pay them on a timely basis in addition we may be unable to renew our current reinsurance coverages or purchase new coverages with respect to certain exposures under our policies including covid19related exposures 

premium volumes may be negatively impacted reduced economic activity relating to the covid19 pandemic will likely decrease demand for our insurance products and services in addition we may alter our view on the insurance coverages that are appropriate to offer in various jurisdictions which could further negatively impact our premium volumes 

investments further disruptions in global financial markets due to the continuing impact of covid19 could cause us to incur additional unrealized andor realized investment losses including impairments in our fixed income portfolio and other investments 

credit risk as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face greater credit risk from our policyholders independent agents and brokers in connection with the payment and remittance of premiums as a result of the economic conditions caused by covid19 similarly our credit risk related to the reimbursement of deductibles from policyholders and in connection with reinsurance recoverables has increased 

operational disruptions and costs our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management or a significant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our agents brokers suppliers or other third party service providers are unable to continue to work because of illness government directives or otherwise in response to the covid19 pandemic we have implemented remote working policies which have resulted in disruptions to our business routines heightened risk to cybersecurity attacks and data security incidents and a greater dependency on internet and telecommunication access and capabilities 

critical accounting estimates 

the following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses assumed reinsurance premiums and otherthantemporary impairments of investments management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments 

reserves for losses and loss expenses  to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among other things historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent a certain calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to uncertainty these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations the company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each operating unit these methods include paid loss development incurred loss development paid and incurred bornhuetterferguson methods and frequency and severity methods in circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others that method is used to set the point estimate for example the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data for new lines of business where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods the actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered industry loss experience is used to supplement the company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the company’s own data is limited the actuarial data is analyzed by line of business coverage and accident or policy year as appropriate for each operating unit 

the establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses these qualitative considerations include among others the impact of reunderwriting initiatives changes in the mix of business changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits the expansion of coverage exclusions whether or not defense costs are within policy limits and changes in deductibles and attachment points 

the key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is priced and written before any actual claims experience has emerged this expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each operating unit expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the longtail lines such as excess casualty and claims with a high medical component such as workers’ compensation reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses and are derived from the company’s own experience and industry data the paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred however different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates 

loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves including expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits retentions rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 

another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses less ibnr is required for lines with short reporting lags as a result loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates for lines with short reporting lags which include commercial automobile primary workers’ compensation other liability claimsmade and property business the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date for lines of business with long reporting lags which include other liability occurrence products liability excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider historically the company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags 

the key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the latest reported loss data current trends and other factors observed if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate the following table reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity relative to our assumptions on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2020 



our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 116 billion as of december 31 2020 relate to multiple accident years therefore the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above the impact of such changes would likely be manifested gradually over the course of many years as the magnitude of the changes became evident 

approximately 26 billion or 22 of the company’s net loss reserves as of december 31 2020 relate to the reinsurance  monoline excess segment there is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of excess workers compensation and assumed reinsurance loss reserves in the case of excess workers’ compensation our policies generally attach at 1 million or higher the claims which reach our layer therefore tend to involve the most serious injuries and many remain open for the lifetime of the claimant which extends the claim settlement tail these claims also occur less frequently but tend to be larger than primary claims which increases claim variability in the case of assumed reinsurance our loss reserve estimates are based in part upon information received from ceding companies if information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct the company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate furthermore due to 

delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is also extended management considers the impact of delayed reporting and the extended tail in its selection of loss development factors for these lines of business 

information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business this information which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies the company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the company the information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks 

following is a summary of the company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of december 31 2020 and 2019 

  



following is a summary of the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses by major line of business as of december 31 2020 and 2019 

  



 

1 reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business are net of an aggregate net discount of 483 million and 530 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

2 shorttail lines include commercial multiperil nonliability inland marine accident and health fidelity and surety boiler and machinery and other lines 

3 reinsurance  monoline excess includes property and casualty reinsurance as well as operations that solely retain risk on an excess basis 

the company evaluates reserves for losses and loss expenses on a quarterly basis changes in estimates of prior year losses are reported when such changes are made the changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends 

certain of the companys insurance and reinsurance contracts are retrospectively rated whereby the company collects more or less premiums based on the level of loss activity for those contracts changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years may be fully or partially offset by additional or return premiums 

net prior year development ie the sum of prior year reserve changes and prior year earned premiums changes for each of the last three years ended december 31 are as follows 



the ongoing covid19 global pandemic has impacted and will likely continue to impact the company’s results through its effect on claim frequency and severity loss cost trends have been impacted and will likely be further impacted by covid19related claims in certain lines of business as well as by other effects of covid19 associated with economic conditions inflation and social distancing and work from home rules for example although it is still too early to determine the net impact it appears that the losses incurred due to covid19related claims are being offset to a certain extent by lower claim frequency in certain lines of our businesses including commercial auto workers’ compensation and other liability however given the continuing nature of the pandemic the impact of covid19 could ultimately increase or decrease overall loss cost trends and is likely to have differing impacts on the companys different lines of business 

most of the covid19related claims reported to the company to date involve certain shorttailed lines of business including contingency and event cancellation business interruption and film production delay the company expects additional claims to be reported for these lines of business the company has also received covid19related claims for longertailed casualty lines of business such as workers’ compensation and other liability however the estimated incurred loss impact for these reported claims appears to be modest at this time given the continuing uncertainty regarding the pandemics pervasiveness the future impact that the pandemic may have on claim frequency and severity remains uncertain at this time in workers’ compensation for example nearly twothirds of the states have enacted rules legislation or administrative orders creating a presumption that certain “essential” workers who contract covid19 did so through the course of their employment several other states are considering similar actions including varying the definition of “essential” workers while the ultimate impact of these presumptions are unknown at this time the company believes that such state actions will likely increase workers’ compensation claims with respect to workers deemed “essential” although this impact may be partially offset by lower workers’ compensation claim frequency with respect to nonessential workers 

the company has estimated the potential covid19 impact to its contingency and event cancellation workers’ compensation and other lines of business under a number of possible scenarios however due to covid19’s evolving impact and the still limited amount of available data there remains a high degree of uncertainty around the company’s covid19 reserves in addition several states and international jurisdictions through regulation legislation andor judicial action continue to seek to expand policy coverage terms beyond the policy’s intended coverage including for example but not limited to property coverages where there are attempts to extend business interruption coverage where there is no physical damage or loss to property and attempts to disregard policy exclusions for communicable disease accordingly losses arising from these actions and the other factors described above could exceed the company’s reserves established for those related policies 

for the year ended december 31 2020 the company recognized losses for covid19related claims activity net of reinsurance of approximately 171 million of which 161 million related to the insurance segment and 10 million related to the reinsurance  monoline excess segment such 171 million of covid19related losses included 95 million of reported losses and 76 million of ibnr 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 16 million in 2020 

insurance  reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 24 million in 2020 net of additional and return premiums continuing the pattern seen in recent years the overall favorable development in 2020 resulted from more significant favorable development on workers’ compensation business which was partially offset by unfavorable development on professional liability including excess professional liability 

for workers’ compensation the favorable development was spread across almost all prior accident years including prior to 2011 but was most significant in accident years 2016 through 2019 the favorable workers’ compensation development reflects a continuation of the benign loss cost trends experienced during recent years particularly the favorable claim frequency trends ie number of reported claims per unit of exposure the long term trend of declining workers’ compensation frequency can be attributable to improved workplace safety loss severity trends were also aided by our continued investment in claims handling initiatives such as medical case management services and vendor savings through usage of preferred provider networks and pharmacy benefit managers reported workers’ compensation losses in 2020 continued to be below our expectations at most of our operating units and were below the assumptions underlying our initial loss ratio picks and our previous reserve estimates for most prior accident years 

for professional liability business unfavorable development was driven mainly by large losses reported in the directors and officers “do” lawyers professional and excess hospital professional liability lines of business for these lines of 

business we continue to see an increase in the number of large losses reported and a lengthening of the reporting “tail” beyond historical levels we believe a contributing cause is rising social inflation in the form of for example higher jury awards on cases that go to trial and the corresponding higher demands from plaintiffs and higher values required to reach settlement on cases that do not go to trial the unfavorable development for professional liability affected mainly accident years 2016 through 2018 

reinsurance  monoline excess – reserves for the reinsurance  monoline excess segment developed unfavorably by 8 million in 2020 the unfavorable development in the segment was driven by nonproportional assumed liability business written in both the us and uk and was partially offset by favorable development on excess workers’ compensation business the unfavorable nonproportional assumed liability development was concentrated in accident years 2014 through 2018 and related primarily to accounts insuring construction projects and professional liability exposures 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 19 million in 2019 

insurance  reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 21 million in 2019 net of additional and return premiums this overall favorable development resulted from more significant favorable development on workers’ compensation business which was partially offset by unfavorable development on professional liability and general liability business 

for workers’ compensation the favorable development was spread across many accident years including prior to 2010 but was most significant in accident years 2014 through 2018 and particularly 2017 and 2018 the favorable workers’ compensation development reflects a continuation during 2019 of the benign loss cost trends experienced during recent years particularly the favorable claim frequency trends ie number of reported claims per unit of exposure the long term trend of declining workers’ compensation frequency can be attributable to improved workplace safety loss severity trends were also aided by our continued investment in claims handling initiatives such as medical case management services and vendor savings through usage of preferred provider networks and pharmacy benefit managers our initial loss ratio “picks” for this line of business over the past few accident years have contemplated an increase in loss cost trends and reflect decreasing premium rates in the marketplace reported workers’ compensation losses in 2019 continued to be below our expectations at most of our operating units and were below the assumptions underlying our initial loss ratio picks and our previous reserve estimates 

for professional liability business the unfavorable development was driven mainly by an increase in the number of large losses reported in the lawyers professional liability and directors and officers “do” liability lines of business many of the lawyers large losses involved claims made against insured law firms relating to work performed on matters stemming from the 2008 financial crisis these claims affected mainly accident years 2013 through 2016 in addition for both of these lines of business we have seen evidence of social inflation in the form of higher jury awards on cases that go to trial and corresponding higher demands from plaintiffs and higher values required to reach settlement on cases that do not go to trial the unfavorable development for do affected mainly accident years 2014 through 2017 

for general liability business most of the unfavorable development emanated from our excess and surplus lines es businesses and was driven by an increase in the number of large losses reported many of these large losses were from construction and contracting classes of business which have also been impacted by social inflation the general liability unfavorable development impacted mainly accident years 2015 through 2018 

reinsurance  monoline excess  reserves for the reinsurance  monoline excess segment developed unfavorably by 2 million in 2019 the unfavorable development in the segment was driven by nonproportional assumed liability business in both the us and uk and was largely offset by favorable development on excess workers’ compensation business the unfavorable nonproportional assumed liability development was concentrated in accident years 2015 through 2018 and included an adjustment for the ogden discount rate in the uk

workers’ compensation losses in 2018 continued to be below our expectations at most of our operating units and were below the assumptions underlying our previous reserve estimates 

for professional liability business adverse development was primarily related to unexpected large directors and officers “do” liability losses at one of our us operating units as well as lawyers professional liability losses at another operating unit the adverse development stemmed primarily from accident years 2015 and 2016 and was driven by a higher frequency of large losses than we had experienced in previous years

fair value measurements  the company’s fixed maturity available for sale securities equity securities and its trading account securities are carried at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available the fair value of the vast majority of the company’s portfolio is based on observable data other than quoted prices and accordingly is classified as level 2 

in classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy the company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable the company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information the company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers the uninterrupted availability of such inputs the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time if the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable the security is categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers and reference data quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions for publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable the company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data for securities traded only in private negotiations the company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer financial data projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information

reinsurance 

the company follows customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its exposures in exchange for paying reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies it writes reinsurance is purchased by the company principally to reduce its net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage the company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and attempts to place its coverages only with financially sound carriers reinsurance coverage and retentions vary depending on the line of business location of the risk and nature of loss the company’s reinsurance purchases include the following 

• property reinsurance treaties  the company purchases property reinsurance to reduce its exposure to large individual property losses and catastrophe events following is a summary of significant property reinsurance treaties in effect as of january 1 2021 the company’s property per risk reinsurance generally covers losses between 25 million and 65 million the company’s catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program provides protection for net losses between 175 million and 395 million for the majority of business written by its us insurance segment operating units and lloyds syndicate excluding offshore energy but some perils are protected above 15 million the company’s catastrophe reinsurance agreements are subject to certain limits exclusions and reinstatement premiums

• facultative reinsurance  the company also purchases facultative reinsurance on certain individual policies or risks that are in excess of treaty reinsurance capacity

the company places a number of its casualty treaties on a “risk attaching” basis under risk attaching treaties all claims from policies incepting during the period of the reinsurance contract are covered even if they occur after the expiration date of the reinsurance contract if the company is unable to renew or replace its existing reinsurance coverage protection for unexpired policies would remain in place until their expiration in such case the company could revise its underwriting strategy for new business to reflect the absence of reinsurance protection the casualty catastrophe treaty highlighted above was purchased on a losses discovered basis property catastrophe and workers’ compensation catastrophe reinsurance is generally placed on a “losses occurring basis” whereby only claims occurring during the period are covered if the company is unable to renew or replace these reinsurance coverages unexpired policies would not be protected though we frequently have the option to purchase runoff coverage in our treaties

3 many states require licensed insurers that provide workers compensation insurance to participate in programs that provide workers compensation to employers that cannot procure coverage from an insurer on a voluntary basis insurers can fulfill this residual market obligation by participating in pools where results are shared by the participating companies the company acts as a servicing carrier for workers compensation pools in certain states as a servicing carrier the company writes residual market business directly and then cedes 100 of this business to the respective pool as a servicing carrier the company receives fee income for its services the company does not retain underwriting risk and credit risk is limited as ceded balances are jointly shared by all the pool members

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk  the fair value of the company’s investments is subject to risks of fluctuations in credit quality and interest rates the company uses various models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage interest rate risk the company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate relationship between the effective duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities ie policy claims and debt obligations the effective duration for the fixed maturity portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was 24 years at december 31 2020 and 28 years at december 31 2019 

in addition the fair value of the company’s international investments is subject to currency risk the company attempts to manage its currency risk by matching its foreign currency assets and liabilities where considered appropriate 

the following table outlines the groups of fixed maturity securities and their effective duration at december 31 2020 



duration is a common measure of the price sensitivity of fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates the company determines the estimated change in fair value of the fixed maturity securities assuming parallel shifts in the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static the estimated fair value at specified levels at december 31 2020 would be as follows 



arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less the company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies including short sales 

additionally the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options selling call options or entering into swap contracts the companys merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks

loss and loss expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among others historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made although the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent 

  

management’s best estimates setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

the company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves the amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was 1731 million and 1793 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the aggregate net discount for those reserves after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 530 million and 563 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively at december 31 2019  discount rates by year ranged from 20 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 37 

substantially all discounted workers’ compensation reserves 97 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2019  are excess workers’ compensation reserves in order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period once established no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized the expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the company’s loss payout experience 

the company also discounts reserves for certain other longduration workers’ compensation reserves representing approximately 3 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2019  including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease these reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 

to date known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the company’s operations because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to significant environmental or asbestos exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language 

the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses relating to environmental and asbestos claims on policies written before adoption of the absolute exclusion was 24 million at december 31 2019 and 28 million at december 31 2018  the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

  

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years 



 

   

also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 13 reserves for losses and loss expenses included in our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the changes in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2019 as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” in the company’s us regulatory filings is as follows 



 

 

  

reinsurance 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

us regulation   

our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 

overview  our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums loss expenses and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

holding company statutes  in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations 

in addition we must annually submit to our lead state regulator an “enterprise risk management report” which identifies the activities and circumstances of any affiliated company that might have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our group or our us licensed insurers 

approximately half the states have also adopted changes to the holding company act that authorize us insurance regulators to lead or participate in the groupwide supervision of certain international insurance groups in november 2019 the international association of insurance supervisors “iais” an international standard setter adopted a global framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups as discussed below under “ international regulation” this framework includes a riskbased groupwide global insurance capital standard “ics” which will undergo a fiveyear monitoring period starting in january 2020 in the us the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” is developing a group capital calculation tool that uses a riskbased capital aggregation methodology for all entities in an insurance holding company system the goal is to provide us regulators with a method to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of each entity in a group in a way that applies to all companies regardless of their structure the naic expects to adopt the group capital calculation tool in 2020 it is unclear how the development of group capital measures will interact with existing capital requirements for insurance companies in the united states and with international capital standards it is possible that we may be required to hold additional capital as a result of these developments 

nearly all states have adopted the naics risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act the “orsa model act” which requires an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an own risk and solvency assessment summary report “orsa” the orsa is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks under orsa we are required to 

 

  

 cybersecurity regulations new york’s cybersecurity regulation for financial services institutions that are authorized by the new york state department of financial services part 500 including our insurance subsidiaries licensed in new york became effective on march 1 2017 the regulation requires these entities to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers’ private data and the confidentiality integrity and availability of the licensee’s information systems on october 24 2017 the naic adopted the insurance data security model law the “cybersecurity model law” which establishes standards for data security the investigation of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to or the misuse of certain nonpublic information and reporting to insurance commissioners the cybersecurity model law imposes significant new regulatory burdens intended to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of information systems its implementation will be based on adoption by state legislatures to date the cybersecurity model law has only been adopted in a few states including one of our domiciliary states importantly a drafting note in the cybersecurity model law states that a licensee’s compliance with the new york cybersecurity regulation is intended to constitute compliance with the cybersecurity model law 

certain states are developing or have developed regulations related to privacy and data security for example in 2018 california enacted the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which broadly regulates the sale of california residents’ personal information and grants california residents certain rights to among other things access and delete data about them in certain circumstances ccpa became effective on january 1 2020 and compliance with the ccpa may increase the cost of providing our services in california other states have considered  and may adopt  similar proposals we cannot predict the impact if any that any proposed or future cybersecurity regulations will have on our business financial condition or results of operations 

riskbased capital requirements  the naic utilizes a riskbased capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the naic rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any rbc action level as of december 31 2019  

insurance regulatory information system the naic also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios for property and casualty insurers referred to as the insurance regulatory information system “iris” on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 

guaranty funds  our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and the insolvent companys available funds are insufficient to pay policyholders and claimants the amounts to which they are entitled the protection afforded under a states guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums in that state the naic postassessment property and liability insurance guaranty association model act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

additionally state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory propertyliability “shared market” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “fair” plans in addition some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 

dividends  we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

  

trade practices  state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers including provisions governing marketing and sales practices policyholder services claims management and complaint handling state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 

investment regulation investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind quality and concentration of investments in general these laws and regulations permit investments in federal state and municipal obligations corporate bonds preferred and common equity securities mortgage loans real estate and certain other investments subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications investments that do not comply with these limits and qualifications are deducted in our insurance subsidiaries calculation of their statutory capital and surplus 

terrorism risk insurance the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism pursuant to the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “tripra” the program was extended until december 31 2027 

tripra provides a federal backstop to all us based property and casualty insurers for insurance related losses resulting from any act of terrorism on us soil or against certain us air carriers vessels or foreign missions tripra is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism tripras definition of certified acts includes domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tripra when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism 

under the program the federal government will pay 81 of an insurers covered losses in excess of the insurers applicable deductible as of january 1 2020 this amount will decrease to 80 on a prorata basis over a fiveyear period that began in 2017 the insurers deductible is based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2019 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2020 will be approximately 993 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 200 million industrywide for calendar year 2020 and any calendar year thereafter tripra limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

excess and surplus lines  the regulation of our us subsidiaries excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business principally with respect to rates and policy forms strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 

federal regulation although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act created two new federal government bodies the federal insurance office the “fio” and the financial stability oversight council the “fsoc” which may impact the regulation of insurance although the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements it does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance the fio has authority to represent the united states in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the us insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk in may 2018 the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act “economic growth act” was signed into law among other things the economic growth act addresses the roles played by federal regulators at international insurance standardsetting forums it directs the director of the fio and the board of governors of the federal reserve to support increased transparency at international standardsetting regulatory forums eg the iais these federal regulations also instruct the fio and the federal reserve to achieve consensus positions with the states through the naic prior to taking a position on any insurance proposal by a global insurance regulatory forum 

the doddfrank act authorizes the secretary of the treasury and us trade representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance a “covered agreement” in september 2017 the us and the european union eu signed the covered agreement 

the covered agreement addresses three areas of prudential supervision reinsurance group supervision and the exchange of information between the us and eu each party is working on its internal requirements and procedures such as amending 

  

or promulgating appropriate statutes and regulations in order for the covered agreement to become effective under the covered agreement reinsurance collateral requirements will no longer apply to qualifying eu reinsurers that sell reinsurance to the us market and us reinsurers operating in the eu market will no longer be subject to “local presence” requirements the covered agreement establishes group supervision practices that apply only to us and eu insurance groups operating in both territories for instance the covered agreement states that provided the us has adopted group supervision including worldwide group governance solvency capital and reporting usheadquartered insurance groups with operations in the eu will be supervised at the worldwide level only by us insurance regulators precluding eu insurance supervisors from exercising solvency and capital requirements over the worldwide operations of usheadquartered insurers 

us states have five years from the date of signature to remove reinsurance collateral requirements for eu reinsurers that meet certain standards such as minimum capital and solvency ratios and claims payment standards while eu member states have two years to revise their “local presence” laws under the doddfrank act the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with the covered agreement in late december 2018 the us department of the treasury and the office of the us trade representative entered into a covered agreement with the uk which will extend the benefits of a covered agreement to the uk after brexit 

additionally in june 2019 the naic adopted amendments to its credit for reinsurance model law in order to satisfy the substantive and timing requirements of the covered agreement and to pave the way for us states to similarly amend their credit for reinsurance laws and avoid potential federal preemption of these laws the naic has also taken steps to make its amended credit for reinsurance model law an accreditation standard for all states the newly amended credit for reinsurance model law also extends the zero reinsurance collateral provisions in the covered agreement to us jurisdictions that are accredited by the naic and to nonus jurisdictions that have not entered into a covered agreement with the us but the naic has identified as “reciprocal jurisdictions” pursuant to the naic qualified jurisdiction process we cannot currently predict the impact of these changes to the law or whether any other covered agreements will be successfully adopted and cannot currently estimate the impact of these changes to the law and any such adopted covered agreements on our business financial condition or operating results 

the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure ie a systemically important financial institution or a nonbank sifi an insurer so designated by fsoc will be subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards there are currently no such nonbank sifis designated by fsoc in november 2017 the us department of treasury issued a report recommending certain changes to fsoc’s process for designating nonbank sifis in order to make the designation process more rigorous clear and transparent on december 4 2019 fsoc approved final guidance related to a revised process for designating nonbank sifis which substantially changes fsoc’s previous procedures by adopting an activitiesbased approach and moving away from the entitiesbased approach the final guidance became effective on january 29 2020 

based upon our current business model and balance sheet we do not believe that we will be designated by the fsoc as such an institution although the potential impacts of the doddfrank act its implementing regulations and potential amendments to the doddfrank act on the us insurance industry are not clear our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically important nonbank financial companies 

international regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by the prudential regulation authority pra andor the financial conduct authority fca the pras primary objectives with regard to insurers are to promote the safety and soundness of insurers and to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for current and future policyholders while the fca has three operational objectives i to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers ii to protect and enhance the integrity of the united kingdoms financial system and iii to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the financial services markets the pra and fca employ a variety of regulatory tools to achieve their objectives including periodic auditing and reporting requirements risk assessment reviews minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements dividend restrictions in certain cases approval requirements governing the appointment of key officers approval requirements governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements certain of our subsidiaries are authorized by the pra to effect and carry out contracts of insurance which includes reinsurance in the uk and are regulated by both the pra and the fca for prudential and conduct of business matters respectively 

our lloyds managing agency is also regulated by lloyds and the lloyds syndicate business is subject to lloyds supervision through lloyds we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of lloyds international licenses in each such country we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country our insurance subsidiary based in liechtenstein is regulated by the financial market authority of liechtenstein which has regulatory tools 

  

analogous to those of the uk regulators noted above additionally uk and liechtenstein laws and regulations also impact us as “controllers” of our europeanregulated subsidiaries whereby we are required to notify the appropriate authorities about significant events relating to such regulated subsidiaries controllers ie persons or entities which have certain levels of direct or indirect voting power or economic interests in the regulated entities as well as changes of control and to submit annual reports regarding their controllers the prafcas senior managers and certification regime and analogous regulation in liechtenstein further provide regulatory frameworks for standards of fitness and propriety conduct and accountability for individuals in positions of responsibility at insurers in addition certain employees are individually registered at lloyds 

an insurance company with authorization to write insurance business in the uk may currently provide crossborder services in the other member states of the european economic area “eea” a group including member states of the eu and norway liechtenstein and iceland these rights may be restricted or modified depending on the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu see below “risks relating to our businessthe united kingdom leaving the eu could adversely affect our business” for more information 

our insurance business throughout the eu and eea is subject to solvency ii an insurance regulatory regime governing among other things capital adequacy and risk management which became effective on january 1 2016 lloyd’s applies a capital adequacy test to all lloyd’s syndicates including our syndicate that is based on solvency ii principles solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency under solvency ii it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii currently the us system of insurance regulation relating to group supervision is not deemed equivalent to solvency ii by european union authorities however we have received a waiver from the pra subject to conditions with respect to the pras supervision of our group which waives the requirement on us to maintain a group solvency capital requirement as calculated under solvency ii rules the covered agreement also prohibits any eu supervisor from exercising groupwide supervision at any level above the highest company organized in the country of that supervisor 

we must also comply with the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” which took effect in may 2018 the regulation’s goal is to impose increased individual rights and protections for all personal data located in or originating from the eu gdpr is extraterritorial in that it applies to all businesses in the eu and any business outside the eu that process eu personal data of individuals in the eu moreover there are significant fines associated with noncompliance in particular we will need to monitor our compliance with all relevant member states laws and regulations including where permitted derogations from the gdpr are introduced the introduction of the gdpr and any resultant changes in eu member states’ national laws and regulations has increased our compliance obligations and has necessitated the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data and has required us to change our business practices regarding these matters 

in addition we may be affected by regulatory policies adopted by the iais an international standard setter consisting of supervisors and regulators from more than 200 jurisdictions the iais has been working on several initiatives to consider changes to insurer solvency standards and group supervision of companies in a holding company system in response to the increasing globalization of the insurance sector in november 2019 the iais formally adopted a global framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups “iaigs” which is referred to as the common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups or “comframe” comframe is intended to provide a framework of basic standards for iaigs and a process for supervisors to cooperate in the supervision of iaigs also in november 2019 the iais adopted a riskbased groupwide global insurance capital standard “ics” that will apply to iaigs and ultimately form a part of comframe the ics will undergo a fiveyear monitoring period starting in january 2020 during which time it will be used for confidential reporting and discussion in supervisory colleges to provide feedback to the iais on the ics’s design and performance but it will not trigger any supervisory action following the monitoring period the ics is expected to be implemented in 2025 as a groupwide prescribed capital requirement for iaigs and integrated into the rest of comframe as noted above under “ us regulation” it is unclear how the development of the ics will interact with existing capital requirements for insurance companies in the united states and the naic’s development of the gcc 

our international operations are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in mexico australia and canada and in certain other countries in europe south america and southeast asia generally our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements while each country imposes licensing solvency auditing and financial reporting requirements the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially key areas where country regulations may differ include i the type of financial reports to be filed ii a requirement to use local intermediaries iii the amount of reinsurance permissible iv the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates and v the type and frequency of regulatory examinations 

  

competition   

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with many insurance companies of various sizes as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as selfinsured retentions or captive programs transacting business in the united states and internationally we compete directly with a large number of these companies competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our operating units can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our operating units establish their own pricing practices based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit 

competition for insurance business within the united states comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers our specialty operating units compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers other regional units compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers additionally direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional units by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company we compete internationally with native insurance operations both large and small which in some cases are related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

competition for reinsurance business which is especially strong comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance partner re and others 

in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively 

employees   

as of january 31 2020  we employed 7493 individuals of this number our subsidiaries employed 7356 persons and the remaining persons were employed at the parent company 

other information about the companys business 

we maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition our operating units develop new coverages or enter lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 

seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance operating units although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms wildfires earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below occur our businesses results of operations andor financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in addition to those described below our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

risks relating to our industry   

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties in demand and pricing causing cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business in recent years we have faced significant competition in our business as a result of new entrants and capital providers as well as existing insurers seeking to gain or maintain market share recently premium rates have increased at an accelerating pace for most lines of business while they have decreased in others most notably workers compensation the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic or social inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return have impacted rate adequacy with interest rates remaining at or near historic lows these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which have pressured premium rates in certain areas and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume   

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies diversified financial services companies and insurtech companies competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided including ease of doing business over the internet speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written in recent years the insurance industry has undergone consolidation which may further increase competition 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial andor marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance market include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers 

over the past several years increased supply has led to significant competition in our business our es operating units have also encountered competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share more recently insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business excluding workers compensation however loss costs have also increased and the duration and magnitude of the improving pricing environment remains uncertain with the low level of interest rates available current price levels for certain lines of business may remain below the prices required for us to achieve our longterm return objectives we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business 

in recent years various types of investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital or access to thirdparty capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively in addition technology companies or other third parties have created and may in the future create technologyenabled business models processes platforms or alternate distribution channels that may adversely impact our competitive position 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms 

  

and conditions acceptable to us if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves   

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately  126 billion as of december 31 2019  our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on managements assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions both inflation overall and medical cost inflation which has historically been greater than inflation overall can have an adverse impact 

reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain   

as industry practices and economic legal judicial social and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include but are not limited to 

 in some instances these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies as a result the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued 

in addition the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue to remove limitations on recovery to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes   

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results for example catastrophe losses net of reinsurance recoveries were 90 million in 2019  105 million in 2018  and 184 million in 2017  similarly manmade catastrophes can also have a material impact on our financial results 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes tsunamis hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist and other manmade activities including drilling mining and other industrial accidents cyber events or terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changing climate conditions may increase the frequency and severity of catastrophic events and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results 

over the past several years changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming appear to have contributed to the unpredictability frequency and severity of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures there is a growing scientific consensus that global warming and other climate change are increasing the frequency and severity of catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods and other natural disasters such changes make it more difficult for us to predict and model catastrophic events reducing our ability to accurately price our exposure to such events and mitigate our risks any increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters may adversely affect our financial condition and results 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts   

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “tripra” for up to 81 of our covered losses as of january 1 2020 for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2019 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2020 is approximately 993 million in addition the coverage provided under tripra does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business   

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered in the united states by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 



  

state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters our insurance business internationally is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations outside the united states 

federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to conditions in the financial markets global insurance supervision and other factors may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 

the doddfrank act effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant nonbank financial companies including insurance companies be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve the doddfrank act also established a federal insurance office “fio” which is authorized to study monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure the potential impact of the doddfrank act as amended by the economic growth act on the us insurance business is not clear our business could be affected by changes whether as a result of the doddfrank act or otherwise to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

although state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in the united states in addition to the changes brought about by the doddfrank act congress has considered various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter and repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarranferguson act we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution in addition the current administration and the volatile political environment may increase the chance of other federal legislative and regulatory changes that could affect us in ways we cannot predict 

with respect to international measures solvency ii the eu regime concerning the capital adequacy risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers may affect our insurance businesses implementation of solvency ii in eu member states occurred on january 1 2016 and as the solvency ii regime evolves over time we may be required to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance in addition despite the waiver of the solvency ii group capital requirements we received solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers additionally our capital requirements and compliance requirements may be adversely affected if the eu commission does not deem the insurance regulatory regimes of the jurisdictions outside the eu in which we have insurance or reinsurance companies domiciled to be equivalent to solvency ii if our compliance with solvency ii or any other regulatory regime is challenged we may be subject to monetary or other penalties in addition in order to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements or as a result of any investigation including remediation efforts we could be required to incur significant expenses and undertake additional work which in turn may divert resources from our business 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may further restrict the conduct of our business 

risks relating to our business 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america canada mexico scandinavia the asiapacific region south africa and australia expose us to increased investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our investments in nonusdenominated assets are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

the united kingdom leaving the eu could adversely affect our business 

the 2016 uk referendum on its membership in the eu resulted in a majority of uk voters voting in favor of the uk leaving the eu “brexit” in accordance with the withdrawal agreement implementing brexit the uk formally left the eu on january 31 2020 the withdrawal agreement provides for a transitional period ending on december 31 2020 during which time the uk will continue to enjoy the same rights and obligations as it had as a member state though without participating in the eu institutions during the transitional period the uk and the eu are expected to negotiate a longterm agreement covering among other things the terms of trade between them which will be based on the principles set out in the accompanying political declaration however eu officials and others have expressed skepticism that such a trade deal can be agreed in the time frame allowed the uk government has stated that it will not seek to extend the transitional period there is therefore a risk that at the end of 2020 no trade deal or only a minimal trade deal will have been completed with the result that a “hard” brexit occurs on december 31 2020 

depending on the terms of the longterm trade deal with the eu andor whether or not a “hard” brexit occurs on december 31 2020 the uk could lose access to the single eu market and to free trade deals with several countries that already have agreements with the eu 

such barriers to trade could affect the attractiveness of the uk and impact our uk business we also face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences related to brexit including with respect to volatility in financial markets exchange rates and interest rates these uncertainties could increase the volatility of or reduce our investment results in particular periods or over time brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and differing laws and regulations between the uk and the eu any of these potential effects and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our president and ceo executive chairman senior executive officers presidents of our operating units experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new products and markets 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses   

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2019  the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 2134 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk certain of these amounts are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

we are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders independent agents and brokers 

in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business including credit risk relating to policyholders independent agents and brokers for example our policyholders independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds 

as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn while we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms our efforts may not be successful for example to reduce such credit risk we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us in cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor 

  

its obligations we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged andor the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit 

we are rated by am best standard  poors moodys and fitch and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poors moodys and fitch our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poors moodys or fitch our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a ratings downgrade could also adversely limit our access to capital markets which may increase the cost of debt a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

if conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable which may result from disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so on terms acceptable to us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience difficulties with our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems our ability to conduct our business could be negatively or severely impacted   

our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe terrorist attack or industrial accident or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if our business continuity plans or system security does not sufficiently address such a business interruption system failure or service denial our ability to write and process new and 

  

renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed 

failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability  

our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks computer viruses hackers employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches our electronic transmission of personal confidential and proprietary information to third parties with whom we have business relationships and our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security while we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these thirdparty vendors and others with whom we do business our vendors and third parties could still suffer data breaches that could result in the exposure of sensitive data and the infiltration of our computer systems our failure to protect sensitive personal and our proprietary information whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors could result in significant monetary and reputational damages these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs as a result our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective   

our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting claim processing and investment activities many of which are highly complex these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies as well as legal and regulatory standards including those related to privacy anticorruption antibribery and global finance and insurance matters our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance that the control systems objectives will be met if our controls are not effective it could lead to financial loss unanticipated risk exposure including underwriting credit and investment risk or damage to our reputation 

we could be adversely affected by recent and future changes in us federal income tax laws 

tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 fundamentally overhauled the us tax system by among other significant changes reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 in the context of the taxation of us propertycasualty insurance companies such as the company the act also modifies the loss reserve discounting rules and the proration rules that apply to reduce reserve deductions to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate it is possible that other legislation could be introduced and enacted by the current congress or future congresses that could have an adverse impact on us new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying provisions of the act may be forthcoming we cannot predict if when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect or their potential impact on us 

risks relating to our investments   

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations   

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2019  our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 142 billion or 726 of our total investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 55 state and municipal securities 281 corporate securities 292 assetbacked securities 197 mortgagebacked securities 115 and foreign government 60 

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise if significant inflation or an increase in interest rates were to occur the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would be negatively impacted conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations additionally given the low interest rate environment we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals 

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession during periods of market disruption it may be difficult to value certain of our securities particularly if trading becomes less frequent andor market data becomes less 

  

observable there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the then current financial environment in such cases more securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment 

although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue many states and municipalities operate under deficits or projected deficits the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuers ability to perform its obligations thereunder additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the continued low inflation actions by the federal reserve economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we have invested a portion of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets which are subject to significant volatility and may decline in value 

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets at december 31 2019  our investment in these assets was approximately 43 billion or 221 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents 

merger and arbitrage trading securities were 4008 million or 21 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2019  merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

real estate related investments including directly owned investment funds and loans receivable were 26 billion or 132 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2019  we also invest in real estate financial services energy transportation and other investment funds the values of these investments are subject to fluctuation based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and the related asset valuations in particular in addition our investments in real estate related assets and other alternative investments are less liquid than our other investments 

these investments are subject to significant volatility as a result of the conditions in the financial and commodity markets and the global economy 

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts 

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries during 2020  the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 601 million  as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations pay dividends or repurchase shares 

laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable and may restrict a stockholders ability to purchase our common stock 

generally united states insurance holding company laws require that before a person can acquire control of an insurance company prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is domiciled pursuant to applicable laws and regulations “control” over an insurer is generally presumed to 

  

exist if any person directly or indirectly owns controls holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 or more of the voting securities of that insurer or any parent company of such insurer indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock thus the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled are likely to apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common stock some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates on the one hand and the target insurer and its affiliates on the other hand have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state additionally many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements 

these provisions can also lead to the imposition of conditions on an acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 

certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 

these provisions include 

 these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

w r berkley corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the united states and operates worldwide in two business segments of the property and casualty business insurance and reinsurance  monoline excess our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches it also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics while providing our business units with certain operating autonomy our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital investment reinsurance and enterprise risk management and actuarial financial and corporate legal staff support the companys primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments 

an important part of our strategy is to form new operating units to capitalize on various business opportunities over the years the company has formed numerous new operating units that are focused on important parts of the economy in the us including healthcare cyber security energy and agriculture and on growing international markets including the asiapacific region south america and mexico 

the profitability of the company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time an insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural and other disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic or social inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses general insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity ie the level of capital employed in the industry and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital 

the company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income and investment gains the company’s invested assets are invested principally in fixed maturity securities the return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities returns available on fixed maturity investments have been at low levels for an extended period 

the company also invests in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets the companys investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced and the company expects to continue to experience greater fluctuations in investment income 

on april 2 2019 a 3for2 common stock split was paid in the form of a stock dividend to holders of record as of march 14 2019 shares outstanding and per share amounts in this form 10k reflect this 3for2 common stock split effected on april 2 2019 

commencing with the first quarter of 2019 the company renamed the reinsurance segment to reinsurance  monoline excess and reclassified the monoline excess business from the insurance segment the reclassified business includes operations that solely retain risk on an excess basis reclassifications have been made to the companys prior periods financial information in this form 10k to conform with this presentation 

critical accounting estimates 

the following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses assumed reinsurance premiums and otherthantemporary impairments of investments management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments 

reserves for losses and loss expenses  to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on 

  

general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among other things historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent a certain calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to uncertainty these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations the company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each operating unit these methods include paid loss development incurred loss development paid and incurred bornhuetterferguson methods and frequency and severity methods in circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others that method is used to set the point estimate for example the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data for new lines of business where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods the actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered industry loss experience is used to supplement the company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the company’s own data is limited the actuarial data is analyzed by line of business coverage and accident or policy year as appropriate for each operating unit 

the establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses these qualitative considerations include among others the impact of reunderwriting initiatives changes in the mix of business changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits the expansion of coverage exclusions whether or not defense costs are within policy limits and changes in deductibles and attachment points 

the key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is priced and written before any actual claims experience has emerged this expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each operating unit expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the longtail lines such as excess casualty and claims with a high medical component such as workers’ compensation reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses and are derived from the company’s own experience and industry data the paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and 

  

related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred however different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates 

loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves including expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits retentions rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 

another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses less ibnr is required for lines with short reporting lags as a result loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates for lines with short reporting lags which include commercial automobile primary workers’ compensation other liability claimsmade and property business the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date for lines of business with long reporting lags which include other liability occurrence products liability excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider historically the company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags 

the key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the latest reported loss data current trends and other factors observed if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate the following table reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity relative to our assumptions on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2019  



our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 107 billion as of december 31 2019 relate to multiple accident years therefore the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above the impact of such changes would likely be manifested gradually over the course of many years as the magnitude of the changes became evident 

approximately 25 billion or 23 of the company’s net loss reserves as of december 31 2019 relate to the reinsurance  monoline excess segment there is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of excess workers compensation and assumed reinsurance loss reserves in the case of excess workers’ compensation our policies generally attach at 1 million or higher the claims which reach our layer therefore tend to involve the most serious injuries and many remain open for the lifetime of the claimant which extends the claim settlement tail these claims also occur less frequently but tend to be larger than primary claims which increases claim variability in the case of assumed reinsurance our loss reserve estimates are based in part upon information received from ceding companies if information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct the company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate furthermore due to delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is also extended management considers the impact of delayed reporting and the extended tail in its selection of loss development factors for these lines of business 

information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business this information which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies the company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the company the information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks 

  

following is a summary of the company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of december 31 2019 and 2018  

  

following is a summary of the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses by major line of business as of december 31 2019 and 2018  

  

 

 the company evaluates reserves for losses and loss expenses on a quarterly basis changes in estimates of prior year losses are reported when such changes are made the changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends 

certain of the companys insurance and reinsurance contracts are retrospectively rated whereby the company collects more or less premiums based on the level of loss activity for those contracts changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years may be fully or partially offset by additional or return premiums 

  

net prior year development ie the sum of prior year reserve changes and prior year earned premiums changes for each of the last three years ended december 31 are as follows 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 19 million in 2019  

insurance  reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 21 million in 2019 net of additional and return premiums this overall favorable development resulted from more significant favorable development on workers’ compensation business which was largely offset by unfavorable development on professional liability and general liability business 

for workers’ compensation the favorable development was spread across many accident years including prior to 2010 but was most significant in accident years 2014 through 2018 and particularly 2017 and 2018 the favorable workers’ compensation development reflects a continuation during 2019 of the benign loss cost trends experienced during recent years particularly the favorable claim frequency trends ie number of reported claims per unit of exposure the long term trend of declining workers’ compensation frequency can be attributable to improved workplace safety loss severity trends were also aided by our continued investment in claims handling initiatives such as medical case management services and vendor savings through usage of preferred provider networks and pharmacy benefit managers our initial loss ratio “picks” for this line of business over the past few accident years have contemplated an increase in loss cost trends and reflect decreasing premium rates in the marketplace reported workers’ compensation losses in 2019 continued to be below our expectations at most of our operating units and were below the assumptions underlying our initial loss ratio picks and our previous reserve estimates 

for professional liability business the unfavorable development was driven mainly by an increase in the number of large losses reported in the lawyers professional liability and directors and officers “do” liability lines of business many of the lawyers large losses involved claims made against insured law firms relating to work performed on matters stemming from the 2008 financial crisis these claims affected mainly accident years 2013 through 2016 in addition for both of these lines of business we have seen evidence of social inflation in the form of higher jury awards on cases which go to trial and corresponding higher demands from plaintiffs and higher values required to reach settlement on cases which do not go to trial the unfavorable development for do affected mainly accident years 2014 through 2017 

for general liability business most of the unfavorable development emanated from our excess and surplus lines es businesses and was driven by an increase in the number of large losses reported many of these large losses were from construction and contracting classes of business which have also been impacted by social inflation the general liability unfavorable development impacted mainly accident years 2015 through 2018 

reinsurance  monoline excess  reserves for the reinsurance  monoline excess segment developed unfavorably by 2 million in 2019 the unfavorable development in the segment was driven by nonproportional assumed liability business in both the us and uk and was largely offset by favorable development on excess workers’ compensation business the unfavorable nonproportional assumed liability development was concentrated in accident years 2015 through 2018 and included an adjustment for the ogden discount rate in the uk 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 39 million in 2018  

insurance  reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 19 million in 2018  the favorable development was primarily attributable to workers’ compensation business and was partially offset by unfavorable development for professional liability business 

for workers’ compensation the favorable development was spread across many accident years but was most significant in accident years 2015 through 2017 the favorable workers’ compensation development reflects a continuation during 2018 of the benign loss cost trends experienced during recent years particularly the favorable claim frequency trends ie number of reported claims per unit of exposure the long term trend of declining workers compensation frequency can be attributable to improved workplace safety loss severity trends were also aided by our continued investment in claims handling initiatives such as medical case management services and vendor savings through usage of preferred provider networks reported workers’ compensation losses in 2018 continued to be below our expectations at most of our operating units and were below the assumptions underlying our previous reserve estimates 

  

for professional liability business adverse development was primarily related to unexpected large directors and officers “do” liability losses at one of our us operating units as well as lawyers professional liability losses at another operating unit the adverse development stemmed primarily from accident years 2015 and 2016 and was driven by a higher frequency of large losses than we had experienced in previous years 

reinsurance  monoline excess  reserves for the reinsurance  monoline excess segment developed favorably by 20 million in 2018 the favorable development was primarily due to excess workers’ compensation business and was spread across many accident years including years prior to 2009 this favorable excess workers’ compensation development was partially offset by unfavorable development on us casualty facultative assumed business from accident years 2009 and prior related to construction projects 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 37 million in 2017  

insurance  reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 30 million in 2017 the favorable development was primarily attributable to workers’ compensation business and was partially offset by unfavorable development for professional liability business 

for workers’ compensation the favorable development was spread across many accident years but was most significant in accident years 2014 through 2016 the favorable workers’ compensation development reflects a continuation during 2017 of the benign loss cost trends experienced in recent years particularly the favorable claim frequency trends ie number of reported claims per unit of exposure reported workers’ compensation losses in 2017 continued to be below our expectations at most of our operating units and were below the assumptions underlying our previous reserve estimates the favorable severity trends were also impacted by our continued investment in medical case management services and the higher usage of preferred provider networks the long term trend of declining workers’ compensation frequency can be attributed to improved workplace safety 

for professional liability business adverse development was primarily related to unexpected large directors and officers “do” liability losses at one of our us operating units and large professional indemnity and do losses in the uk the adverse development stemmed mainly from accident years 2013 through 2016 in the us and 2011 through 2016 in the uk 

reinsurance  monoline excess  reserves for the reinsurance  monoline excess segment developed favorably by 7 million in 2017 this favorable development was primarily due to excess workers’ compensation business and was spread across many accident years including years prior to 2008 the favorable excess workers’ compensation development resulted due to the same causes discussed above for workers’ compensation in the insurance segment 

the favorable excess workers’ compensation development was largely offset by adverse development on uk assumed casualty reinsurance as well as on us facultative casualty excess of loss business the adverse development on the uk casualty reinsurance was due to reserve strengthening associated with claims impacted by the change in the ogden discount rate in the uk the ogden rate is the discount rate used to calculate lumpsum bodily injury payouts in the uk and was reduced by the uk ministry of justice from 25 to 075 the adverse development mostly related to uk motor bodily injury claims which we reinsured on an excess of loss basis in accident years 2012 through 2016 the adverse development on us facultative casualty business was due to construction related risks in accident years 2008 and prior 

reserve discount  the company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves the amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was  1731 million and  1793 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the aggregate net discount for those reserves after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 530 million and 563 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively at december 31 2019  discount rates by year ranged from 20 to 65  with a weighted average discount rate of 37  

substantially all discounted workers’ compensation reserves  97 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2019  are excess workers’ compensation reserves in order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period once established no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized the expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the company’s loss payout experience 

the company also discounts reserves for certain other longduration workers’ compensation reserves representing approximately 3 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2019  including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease these reserves are discounted at statutory rates prescribed or permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 

  

assumed reinsurance premiums  the company estimates the amount of assumed reinsurance premiums that it will receive under treaty reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contracts these premium estimates are revised as the actual amount of assumed premiums is reported to the company by the ceding companies as estimates of assumed premiums are made or revised the related amount of earned premiums commissions and incurred losses associated with those premiums are recorded estimated assumed premiums receivable were approximately 43 million and 41 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the assumed premium estimates are based upon terms set forth in reinsurance agreements information received from ceding companies during the underwriting and negotiation of agreements reports received from ceding companies and discussions and correspondence with reinsurance intermediaries the company also considers its own view of market conditions economic trends and experience with similar lines of business these premium estimates represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate amount of premiums to be received under its assumed reinsurance agreements 

otherthantemporary impairments otti of investments  the cost of securities is adjusted where appropriate to include a provision for decline in value which is considered to be otherthantemporary an otherthantemporary decline is considered to occur in investments where there has been a sustained reduction in fair value and where the company does not expect the fair value to recover prior to the time of sale or maturity 

the company classifies its fixed maturity securities by credit rating primarily based on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies for purposes of classifying securities with different ratings the company uses the average of the credit ratings assigned unless in limited situations the companys own analysis indicates an internal rating is more appropriate securities that are not rated by a rating agency are evaluated and classified by the company on a casebycase basis 

fixed maturity securities – for securities that we intend to sell or more likely than not would be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be otti the amount of otti is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value at the balance sheet date for securities that we do not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an otti if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security ie the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 

the portion of the decline in value considered to be a credit loss ie the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security is recognized in earnings the portion of the decline in value not considered to be a credit loss ie the difference in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value of the security is recognized in other comprehensive income 

  

impairment assessments for structured securities including mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities collateralized debt obligations and corporate debt are generally evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios that may involve subjective judgments and estimates by management modeling these securities involves various factors such as projected default rates the nature and realizable value of the collateral if any the ability of the issuer to make scheduled payments historical performance and other relevant economic and performance factors if an otti determination is made a discounted cash flow analysis is used to ascertain the amount of the credit impairment 

the following table provides a summary of fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position as of december 31 2019  



a summary of the company’s noninvestment grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2019 is presented in the table below 

  

the company has evaluated its fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and believes the unrealized loss is due primarily to temporary market and sectorrelated factors rather than to issuerspecific factors none of these securities are delinquent or in default under financial covenants based on its assessment of these issuers the company expects them to continue to meet their contractual payment obligations as they become due and does not consider any of these securities to be otti for the year ended december 31 2019  there were no otti for fixed maturity securities recognized in earnings for the year ended december 31 2018  there were 6 million of otti recognized on fixed maturity securities 

loans receivable – the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable including current market conditions for each loan and the ability to collect principal and interest for loans where the company determines it is probable that the contractual terms will not be met an analysis is performed and a valuation reserve is established if necessary with a charge to earnings loans receivable are reported net of a valuation reserve of 2 million for december 31 2019 and 3 million for december 31 2018  

the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable and assesses the ability of each borrower to pay principal and interest based upon loan structure underlying property values cash flow and related financial and operating performance of the property and market conditions loans receivable with a potential for default are further assessed using discounted cash flow analysis and comparable cost and sales methodologies if appropriate 

fair value measurements  the company’s fixed maturity available for sale securities equity securities and its trading account securities are carried at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available the fair value of the vast majority of the company’s portfolio is based on observable data other than quoted prices and accordingly is classified as level 2 

  

in classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy the company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable the company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information the company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers the uninterrupted availability of such inputs the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time if the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable the security is categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers and reference data quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions for publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable the company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data for securities traded only in private negotiations the company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer financial data projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information 

the following is a summary of pricing sources for the companys fixed maturity securities available for sale as of december 31 2019  

  

independent pricing services  substantially all of the company’s fixed maturity securities available for sale were priced by independent pricing services generally one us pricing service plus additional pricing services with respect to a limited number of foreign securities held by the company the prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets eg broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities the determination of whether markets are active or inactive is based upon the volume and level of activity for a particular asset class the company reviews the prices provided by pricing services for reasonableness based upon current trading levels for similar securities if the prices appear unusual to the company they are reexamined and the value is either confirmed or revised in addition the company periodically performs independent price tests of a sample of securities to ensure proper valuation and to verify our understanding of how securities are priced as of december 31 2019  the company did not make any adjustments to the prices provided by the pricing services based upon the company’s review of the methodologies used by the independent pricing services these securities were classified as level 2 

syndicate manager – the company has a 15 participation in a lloyd’s syndicate and the company’s share of the securities owned by the syndicate is priced by the syndicate’s manager the majority of the securities are liquid short duration fixed maturity securities the company reviews the syndicate manager’s pricing methodology and audited financial statements and holds discussions with the syndicate manager as necessary to confirm its understanding and agreement with security prices based upon the company’s review of the methodologies used by the syndicate manager these securities were classified as level 2 

observable data – if independent pricing is not available the company prices the securities directly prices are based on observable market data where available including current trading levels for similar securities and nonbinding quotations from brokers the company generally requests two or more quotes if more than one quote is received the company sets a price within the range of quotes received based on its assessment of the credibility of the quote and its own evaluation of the security the company generally does not adjust quotes obtained from brokers since these securities were priced based on observable data they were classified as level 2 

cash flow model – if the above methodologies are not available the company prices securities using a discounted cash flow model based upon assumptions as to prevailing credit spreads interest rates and interest rate volatility time to maturity 

  

and subordination levels discount rates are adjusted to reflect illiquidity where appropriate these securities were classified as level 3

the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static the estimated fair value at specified levels at december 31 2019 would be as follows

loss and loss expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among others historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made although the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

the company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves the amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was 1793 million and 1855 million at december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively the aggregate net discount for those reserves after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 563 million and 591 million at december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively at december 31 2018  discount rates by year ranged from 20 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 38 

substantially all discounted workers’ compensation reserves 97 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2018  are excess workers’ compensation reserves in order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period once established no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized the expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the company’s loss payout experience 

the company also discounts reserves for certain other longduration workers’ compensation reserves representing approximately 3 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2018  including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease these reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 

to date known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the company’s operations because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to significant environmental or asbestos exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language 

the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims on policies written before adoption of the absolute exclusion was 28 million at december 31 2018 and 30 million at december 31 2017  the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years 



 

   

also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 13 reserves for losses and loss expenses included in our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the changes in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2018 as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” in the company’s us regulatory filings is as follows 



 



reinsurance 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

us regulation   

our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 

overview  our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums loss expenses and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

holding company statutes  in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations 

in addition we must annually submit to our lead state regulator an “enterprise risk management report” which identifies the activities and circumstances of any affiliated company that might have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our group or our us licensed insurers 

approximately half the states have also adopted changes to the holding company act that authorize us insurance regulators to lead or participate in the groupwide supervision of certain international insurance groups international standard setters such as the international association of insurance supervisors “iais” are developing capital standards for international groups and us insurance regulators are currently working on us group capital standards for insurance groups in 2019 the iais expects to conduct the final round of field testing of the insurance capital standard for internationally active insurance groups the us group capital calculation is expected to incorporate existing riskbased capital standards the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” intends to enter the next phase of development by field testing the calculation tool in early 2019 using yearend 2018 data it is unclear how the development of group capital measures will interact with existing capital requirements for insurance companies in the united states and with international capital standards it is possible that we may be required to hold additional capital as a result of these developments 

most states have adopted the naics risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act the “orsa model act” which requires an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an own risk and solvency assessment summary report “orsa” the orsa is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks under orsa we are required to 

 

 

cybersecurity regulations new york’s cybersecurity regulation for financial services institutions that are authorized by the new york state department of financial services part 500 including our insurance subsidiaries licensed in new york became effective on march 1 2017 the regulation which is being implemented in stages requires these entities to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers’ private data and the confidentiality integrity and availability of the licensee’s information systems on october 24 2017 the naic adopted the insurance data security model law the “cybersecurity model law” which establishes standards for data security the investigation of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to or the misuse of certain nonpublic information and reporting to insurance commissioners the cybersecurity model law imposes significant new regulatory burdens intended to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of information systems its implementation will be based on adoption by state legislatures to date the cybersecurity model law has only been adopted in south carolina importantly a drafting note in the cybersecurity model law states that a licensee’s compliance with the new york cybersecurity regulation is intended to constitute compliance with the cybersecurity model law we made the initial certifications as required by part 500 for licensed entities finally privacy and data security legislation has become an issue in many states and localities over the last 12 months for example in 2018 california enacted the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which broadly regulates the sale of california residents’ personal information and grants california residents certain rights to among other things access and delete data about them in certain circumstances ccpa goes into effect on january 1 2020 and compliance with the ccpa may increase the cost of providing our services in california other states have considered  and may adopt  similar proposals we cannot predict the impact if any that any proposed or future cybersecurity regulations will have on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risk based capital requirements  the naic utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the naic rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any rbc action level as of december 31 2018  

insurance regulatory information system the naic also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the insurance regulatory information system “iris” on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 

guaranty funds  our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and the insolvent companys available funds are insufficient to pay policyholders and claimants the amounts to which they are entitled the protection afforded under a states guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums in that state the naic postassessment property and liability insurance guaranty association model act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

additionally state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory propertyliability “shared market” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “fair” plans in addition some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 

dividends  we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

trade practices  state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers including provisions governing marketing and sales practices policyholder services claims management and complaint handling state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 

investment regulation investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind quality and concentration of investments in general these laws and regulations permit investments in federal state and municipal obligations corporate bonds preferred and common equity securities mortgage loans real estate and certain other investments subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications investments that do not comply with these limits and qualifications are deducted in our insurance subsidiaries calculation of their statutory capital and surplus 

terrorism risk insurance the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism pursuant to the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “tripra” the program has been extended for a six year period ending on december 31 2020 tripra provides a federal backstop to all us based property and casualty insurers for insurance related losses resulting from any act of terrorism on us soil or against certain us air carriers vessels or foreign missions tripra is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism tripras definition of certified acts includes domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tripra when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will currently pay 82 of an insurers covered losses in excess of the insurers applicable deductible this amount will decrease to 80 on a prorata basis over five years which began in 2017 the insurers deductible is based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2018 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2019 will be approximately 969 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 180 million industrywide for calendar year 2019 this threshold will increase to 200 million on a prorata basis over five years which began in 2016 tripra limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

excess and surplus lines  the regulation of our us subsidiaries excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business principally with respect to rates and policy forms strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 

federal regulation although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act created two new federal government bodies the federal insurance office the “fio” and the financial stability oversight council the “fsoc” which may impact the regulation of insurance although the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements it does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance the fio has authority to represent the united states in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the us insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk in may 2018 the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act “economic growth act” was signed into law among other things the economic growth act addresses the roles played by federal regulators at international insurance standardsetting forums it directs the director of the fio and the board of governors of the federal reserve to support increased transparency at international standardsetting regulatory forums eg the iais these federal regulations also instruct the fio and the federal reserve to achieve consensus positions with the states through the naic prior to taking a position on any insurance proposal by a global insurance regulatory forum 

the doddfrank act authorizes the secretary of the treasury and us trade representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance a “covered agreement” in january 2017 the us department of treasury and the us trade representative announced the completion of covered agreement negotiations with the european union “eu” 

the covered agreement addresses three areas of prudential supervision reinsurance group supervision and the exchange of information between the us and eu in september 2017 the us and eu signed the covered agreement each party has begun the process of completing its internal requirements and procedures such as amending or promulgating appropriate statutes and regulations in order for the covered agreement to enter into force under the covered agreement reinsurance collateral requirements will no longer apply to qualifying eu reinsurers that sell reinsurance to the us market and us reinsurers operating in the eu market will no longer be subject to “local presence” requirements the covered agreement establishes group supervision practices that apply only to us and eu insurance groups operating in both territories for 

instance the covered agreement provides that us insurance groups with operations in the eu will be supervised at the worldwide level only by us insurance regulators and precludes eu insurance supervisors from exercising solvency and capital requirements over the worldwide operations of us insurers 

us states have five years from the date of signature to remove reinsurance collateral requirements for eu reinsurers that meet certain standards such as minimum capital and solvency ratios and claims payment standards while eu member states have two years to revise their “local presence” laws under the doddfrank act the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with the covered agreement accordingly the naic is working on proposed amendments to the naic’s credit for reinsurance model law in order to satisfy the substantive and timing requirements of the covered agreement additionally in late december 2018 the us department of the treasury and the office of the us trade representative entered into a covered agreement with the uk which will extend the benefits of the covered agreement to the uk after brexit we cannot currently predict the impact of these changes to the law or whether any other covered agreements will be successfully adopted and cannot currently estimate the impact of these changes to the law and any such adopted covered agreements on our business financial condition or operating results 

the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure ie a systemically important financial institution an insurer so designated by fsoc will be subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards as of december 31 2018 there are no longer any nonbank financial firms including insurance groups designated as systemically significant in november 2017 the us department of treasury issued a report recommending certain changes to fsoc’s process for designating nonbank financial companies as systemically significant in order to make the designation process more rigorous clear and transparent to date the fsoc has not updated its rules to reflect these recommendations 

based upon our current business model and balance sheet we do not believe that we will be designated by the fsoc as such an institution although the potential impacts of the doddfrank act its implementing regulations and potential amendments to the doddfrank act on the us insurance industry are not clear our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically important nonbank financial companies 

international regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by the prudential regulation authority pra andor the financial conduct authority fca the pras primary objectives with regard to insurers are to promote the safety and soundness of insurers and to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for current and future policyholders while the fca has three operational objectives i to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers ii to protect and enhance the integrity of the united kingdom financial system and iii to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the financial services markets the pra and fca employ a variety of regulatory tools to achieve their objectives including periodic auditing and reporting requirements risk assessment reviews minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements dividend restrictions in certain cases approval requirements governing the appointment of key officers approval requirements governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements certain of our uk subsidiaries are authorized by the pra to effect and carry out contracts of insurance which includes reinsurance in the uk and are regulated by both the pra and the fca for prudential and conduct of business matters respectively 

our lloyds managing agency is regulated by the pra fca and lloyds and the lloyds syndicate business is subject to lloyds supervision through lloyds we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of lloyds international licenses in each such country we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country our insurance subsidiary based in liechtenstein is regulated by the financial market authority of liechtenstein which has regulatory tools analogous to those of the uk regulators noted above additionally uk and liechtenstein laws and regulations also impact us as “controllers” of our europeanregulated subsidiaries whereby we are required to notify the appropriate authorities about significant events relating to such regulated subsidiaries controllers ie persons or entities which have certain levels of direct or indirect voting power or economic interests in the regulated entities as well as changes of control and to submit annual reports regarding their controllers the prafcas senior managers and certification regime and analogous regulation in liechtenstein further provide regulatory frameworks for standards of fitness and propriety conduct and accountability for individuals in positions of responsibility at insurers in addition certain employees are individually registered at lloyds 

an insurance company with authorization to write insurance business in the uk may currently provide crossborder services in the other member states of the european economic area “eea” a group including member states of the european union “eu” in addition to switzerland norway liechtenstein and iceland these rights may be restricted or modified depending on the united kingdom’s planned withdrawal from the eu andor eeasee below “risks relating to our businessthe united kingdom leaving the eu could adversely affect our business” for more information 

our insurance business throughout the eu and eea is subject to solvency ii an insurance regulatory regime governing among other things capital adequacy and risk management which became effective on january 1 2016 lloyd’s applies a capital adequacy test to all lloyd’s syndicates including our syndicate that is based on solvency ii principles solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency under solvency ii it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii currently the us system of insurance regulation relating to group supervision is not deemed equivalent to solvency ii by european union authorities however we have received a waiver from the pra subject to conditions with respect to the pras supervision of our group which waives the requirement on us to maintain a group solvency capital requirement as calculated under solvency ii rules the covered agreement also prohibits any eu supervisor from exercising groupwide supervision at any level above the highest company organized in the country of that supervisor 

we must also comply with the recently enacted eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” which took effect in may 2018 the regulation’s goal is to impose increased individual rights and protections for all personal data located in or originating from the eu gdpr is extraterritorial in that it applies to all businesses in the eu and any business outside the eu that process eu personal data of individuals in the eu moreover there are significant fines associated with noncompliance in particular as the european member states reframe their national legislation to prepare for and harmonize with the gdpr we will need to monitor our compliance with all relevant member states laws and regulations including where permitted derogations from the gdpr are introduced the introduction of the gdpr and any resultant changes in eu member states’ national laws and regulations may increase our compliance obligations and may necessitate the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data and may require us to change our business practices regarding these matters 

our international operations are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in mexico australia and canada and in certain other countries in europe south america and southeast asia generally our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements while each country imposes licensing solvency auditing and financial reporting requirements the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially key areas where country regulations may differ include i the type of financial reports to be filed ii a requirement to use local intermediaries iii the amount of reinsurance permissible iv the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates and v the type and frequency of regulatory examinations 

competition   

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with many insurance companies of various sizes as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as selfinsured retentions or captive programs transacting business in the united states and internationally we compete directly with a large number of these companies competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our operating units can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our operating units establish their own pricing practices based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit 

competition for the insurance business within the united states comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers our specialty operating units compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers other regional units compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers additionally direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional units by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company our insurance operations compete internationally with native insurance operations both large and small which in some cases are related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

competition for the reinsurance business which is especially strong comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance partner re and others 

in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively 

employees   

as of january 31 2019  we employed 7448 individuals of this number our subsidiaries employed 7310 persons and the remaining persons were employed at the parent company 

other information about the companys business 

we maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition our operating units develop new coverages or enter lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 

seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance operating units although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms wildfires earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 

we have no customer that accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues 

compliance by w r berkley and its subsidiaries with federal state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below occur our businesses results of operations andor financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in addition to those described below our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

risks relating to our industry   

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties in demand and pricing causing cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business in recent years we have faced significant competition in our business as a result of new entrants and capital providers as well as existing insurers seeking to gain market share as a result premium rates have increased at a modest pace for certain lines of business while they have decreased in others the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return have impacted rate adequacy with interest rates remaining at or near historic lows these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which have pressured premium rates in certain areas and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume   

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided including ease of doing business over the internet speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written in recent years the insurance industry has undergone increasing consolidation which may further increase competition 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial andor marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers 

over the past several years increased supply has led to significant competition in our business our es operating units have also encountered competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share although insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business since 2011 the rate of increase declined in more recent years before beginning to modestly accelerate again loss costs have also increased over that period of time with the low level of interest rates available current price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for us to achieve our longterm return objectives we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and as a result pressure on pricing and policy terms and conditions 

in recent years various types of investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital or access to thirdparty capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively in addition technology companies or other third parties have created and may in the future create technologyenabled business models processes platforms or alternate distribution channels that may adversely impact our competitive position 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms 

and conditions acceptable to us if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves   

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately  120 billion as of december 31 2018  our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on managements assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions both inflation overall and medical cost inflation which has historically been greater than inflation overall can have an adverse impact 

reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain   

as industry practices and economic legal judicial social and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include but are not limited to 

 in some instances these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies as a result the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued 

in addition the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue to remove limitations on recovery to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business 

the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes   

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results for example catastrophe losses net of reinsurance recoveries were 105 million in 2018  184 million in 2017  and 105 million in 2016  similarly manmade catastrophes can also have a material impact on our financial results 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes tsunamis hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist and other manmade activities including drilling mining and other industrial accidents cyber events or terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changing climate conditions may increase the frequency and severity of catastrophic events and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results 

over the past several years changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming appear to have contributed to the unpredictability frequency and severity of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures there is a growing scientific consensus that global warming and other climate change are increasing the frequency and severity of catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods and other natural disasters such changes make it more difficult for us to predict and model catastrophic events reducing our ability to accurately price our exposure to such events and mitigate our risks any increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters may adversely affect our financial condition and results 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts   

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “tripra” for up to 82 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2018 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2019 is approximately 969 million tripra is currently in effect through december 31 2020 in addition the coverage provided under tripra does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business   

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered in the united states by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

 state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters our insurance business internationally is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations outside the united states 

federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to conditions in the financial markets global insurance supervision and other factors may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 

the doddfrank act effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant nonbank financial companies including insurance companies be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve the doddfrank act also established a federal insurance office “fio” which is authorized to study monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure the potential impact of the doddfrank act as amended by the recent economic growth act on the us insurance business is not clear our business could be affected by changes whether as a result of the doddfrank act or otherwise to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

although state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in the united states in addition to the changes brought about by the doddfrank act congress has considered various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter and repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarranferguson act we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution in addition the current administration and the volatile political environment may increase the chance of other federal legislative and regulatory changes that could affect us in ways we cannot predict 

with respect to international measures solvency ii the eu regime concerning the capital adequacy risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers may affect our insurance businesses implementation of solvency ii in eu member states occurred on january 1 2016 and as the solvency ii regime evolves over time we may be required to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance in addition despite the waiver of the solvency ii group capital requirements we received solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers additionally our capital requirements and compliance requirements may be adversely affected if the eu commission does not deem the insurance regulatory regimes of the jurisdictions outside the eu in which we have insurance or reinsurance companies domiciled to be equivalent to solvency ii if our compliance with solvency ii or any other regulatory regime is challenged we may be subject to monetary or other penalties in addition in order to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements or as a result of any investigation including remediation efforts we could be required to incur significant expenses and undertake additional work which in turn may divert resources from our business 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may further restrict the conduct of our business 

risks relating to our business 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america canada mexico scandinavia the asiapacific region africa and australia expose us to increased investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our investments in nonusdenominated assets are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

the united kingdom leaving the eu could adversely affect our business 

the 2016 uk referendum on its membership in the eu resulted in a majority of uk voters voting in favor of the uk leaving the eu “brexit” on march 29 2017 the uk government formally notified the european council of the uk’s intention to withdraw from the eu the member withdrawal provisions in the eu treaty provide that the uk and the eu will negotiate a withdrawal agreement by march 29 2019 unless such deadline is extended by unanimous vote of the eu member 

states as part of the sequenced approach to the talks set out by the eu sufficient progress needs to be made on the withdrawal arrangements before any talks on a future trade deal between the eu and the uk can begin in november 2018 the uk and eu announced agreement on a draft text of a withdrawal agreement which would include the application of transitional provisions under which eu law would broadly remain in force in the uk until the end of 2020 however there is uncertainty as to whether the withdrawal agreement which is subject to approval of the uk parliament and has been rejected in its current form will actually be entered in the absence of such an agreement there would be no transitional provisions and a hard brexit would occur on march 29 2019 unless the uk government were to revoke its withdrawal notice or if the two year period to reach agreement were extended 

depending on the terms of the withdrawal the uk could lose access to the single eu market and to free trade deals with several countries that already have agreements with the eu such a decline in trade could affect the attractiveness of the uk and impact our uk business we also face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences related to brexit including with respect to volatility in financial markets exchange rates and interest rates these uncertainties could increase the volatility of or reduce our investment results in particular periods or over time brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and differing laws and regulations between the uk and the eu any of these potential effects and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our president and ceo executive chairman senior executive officers presidents of our operating units experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new products and markets 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses   

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2018  the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 1932 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk certain of these amounts are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

we are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders independent agents and brokers 

in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business including credit risk relating to policyholders independent agents and brokers for example our policyholders independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds 

as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn while we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms our efforts may not be successful for example to reduce such credit risk we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us in cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged andor the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit 

we are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poors or moodys our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a ratings downgrade could also adversely limit our access to capital markets which may increase the cost of debt a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

if conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable which may result from disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so on terms acceptable to us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience difficulties with our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems our ability to conduct our business could be negatively or severely impacted   

our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe terrorist attack or industrial accident or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if our business continuity plans or system security does not sufficiently address such a business interruption system failure or service denial our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed 

failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability  

our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks computer viruses hackers employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches our electronic transmission of personal confidential and proprietary information to third parties with whom we have business relationships and our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security while we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these thirdparty vendors and others with whom we do business our vendors and third parties could still suffer data breaches that could result in the exposure of sensitive data and the infiltration of our computer systems our failure to protect sensitive personal and our proprietary information whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our 

vendors could result in significant monetary and reputational damages these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs as a result our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective   

our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting claim processing and investment activities many of which are highly complex these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies as well as legal and regulatory standards including those related to privacy anticorruption antibribery and global finance and insurance matters our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance that the control systems objectives will be met if our controls are not effective it could lead to financial loss unanticipated risk exposure including underwriting credit and investment risk or damage to our reputation 

we could be adversely affected by recent and future changes in us federal income tax laws 

tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 fundamentally overhauled the us tax system by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax limiting the deductibility of business interest expense introducing a base erosion and antiavoidance tax aimed at crossborder deductible payments to related foreign persons moving closer to a territorial system of taxing earnings generated through foreign subsidiaries and imposing a onetime deemed repatriation tax on certain post1986 undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the context of the taxation of us propertycasualty insurance companies such as the company the act also modifies the loss reserve discounting rules and the proration rules that apply to reduce reserve deductions to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate although we believe that the changes introduced by the act should generally benefit us we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the act and its implementing regulations in addition it is possible that other legislation could be introduced and enacted by the current congress or future congresses that could have an adverse impact on us new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying provisions of the act may be forthcoming we cannot predict if when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect or their potential impact on us 

risks relating to our investments   

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations   

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2018  our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 136 billion or 735 of our total investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 52 state and municipal securities 289 corporate securities 303 assetbacked securities 179 mortgagebacked securities 118 and foreign government 59 

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise if significant inflation or an increase in interest rates were to occur the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would be negatively impacted conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations additionally given the low interest rate environment we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals 

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession during periods of market disruption it may be difficult to value certain of our securities particularly if trading becomes less frequent andor market data becomes less observable there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment in such cases more securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment 

although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue many states and municipalities operate under deficits or projected deficits the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuers 

ability to perform its obligations thereunder additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the continued low inflation actions by the federal reserve economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we have invested a portion of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets which are subject to significant volatility and may decline in value 

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets at december 31 2018  our investment in these assets was approximately 41 billion or 221 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents 

merger and arbitrage trading securities were 4526 million or 24 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2018  merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

real estate related investments including directly owned investment funds and loans receivable were 27 billion or 144 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2018  we also invest in aviation and rail equipment funds creditrelated funds and energy and other investment funds the values of these investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and the related asset valuations in particular in addition our investments in real estate related assets and other alternative investments are less liquid than our other investments 

these investments are subject to significant volatility as a result of the conditions in the financial and commodity markets and the global economy 

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts 

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries during 2019  the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 11 billion  as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations pay dividends or repurchase shares 

laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable and may restrict a stockholders ability to purchase our common stock 

generally united states insurance holding company laws require that before a person can acquire control of an insurance company prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is domiciled pursuant to applicable laws and regulations “control” over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person directly or indirectly owns controls holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 or more of the voting securities of that insurer or any parent company of such insurer indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock thus the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled are likely to apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common stock some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates on the one hand and the target insurer and its affiliates on the other hand have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state additionally many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements 

these provisions can also lead to the imposition of conditions on an acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 

certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 

these provisions include 

 these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

w r berkley corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the united states and operates worldwide in two business segments of the property and casualty business insurance and reinsurance our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches it also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics while providing our business units with certain operating autonomy our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital investment reinsurance and enterprise risk management and actuarial financial and corporate legal staff support the companys primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments 

an important part of our strategy is to form new operating units to capitalize on various business opportunities over the years the company has formed numerous new operating units that are focused on important parts of the economy in the us including healthcare cyber security energy and agriculture and on growing international markets including the asiapacific region south america and mexico 

the profitability of the company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time an insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural and other disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses general insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity ie the level of capital employed in the industry and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital 

the company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income and investment gains the company’s invested assets are invested principally in fixed maturity securities the return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities returns available on fixed maturity investments have been at low levels for an extended period although recently interest rates have increased 

the company also invests in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds including energy related funds private equity loans and real estate related assets the companys investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced and the company expects to continue to experience greater fluctuations in investment income 

through the second quarter of 2018 the company used the argentine peso “ars” as its functional currency for its business in argentina and translated the financial statements of its argentine operations into us dollars usd exchange rate movements through the second quarter of 2018 between the ars and usd had been recorded as a currency translation gain or loss which is a component of aoci based on recent ars inflation rate movements the company concluded that effective july 1 2018 the argentine economy is considered highly inflationary under gaap this conclusion required the company to change the functional currency of its argentine operations to usd commencing july 1 2018 and accordingly the company recognized foreign exchange gains and losses in earnings for any transactions in the argentine operations that are not usd denominated 

effective january 1 2018 the company adopted new accounting standards including asu 201409 revenue from customers asu 201601 financial instruments and asu 201802 reporting comprehensive income refer to note 1 in the financial statements for further information on the accounting guidance and impact of its adoption on the companys results and financial position 

on february 21 2019 the company announced that its board of directors approved a 3for2 common stock split to be paid in the form of a stock dividend to holders of record on march 14 2019 the additional shares are expected to be issued on april 2 2019 

critical accounting estimates 

the following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses assumed premiums and otherthantemporary impairments of investments management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments 

reserves for losses and loss expenses  to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among other things historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent a certain calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to uncertainty these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations the company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each operating unit these methods include paid loss development incurred loss development paid and incurred bornhuetterferguson methods and frequency and severity methods in circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others that method is used to set the point estimate for example the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data for new lines of business where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods the actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered industry loss experience is used to supplement the company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the company’s own data is limited the actuarial data is analyzed by line of business coverage and accident or policy year as appropriate for each operating unit 

the establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses these qualitative considerations include among others the impact of reunderwriting initiatives changes in the mix of business changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits the expansion of coverage exclusions whether or not defense costs are within policy limits and changes in deductibles and attachment points 

the key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is priced and written before any actual claims experience has emerged this expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each operating unit expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the longtail lines such as excess casualty and claims with a high medical component such as workers’ compensation reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses and are derived from the company’s own experience and industry data the paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred however different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates 

loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves including expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits retentions rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 

another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses less ibnr is required for lines with short reporting lags as a result loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates for lines with short reporting lags which include commercial automobile primary workers’ compensation other liability claimsmade and property business the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date for lines of business with long reporting lags which include other liability occurrence products liability excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider historically the company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags 

the key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the latest reported loss data current trends and other factors observed if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate the following table reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity relative to our assumptions on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2018  



our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 102 billion as of december 31 2018 relate to multiple accident years therefore the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above the impact of such changes would likely be manifested gradually over the course of many years as the magnitude of the changes became evident 

approximately 16 billion or 15 of the company’s net loss reserves as of december 31 2018 relate to the reinsurance segment there is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of assumed loss reserves because those estimates are based in part upon information received from ceding companies if information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct the company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate furthermore due to delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is extended management considers the impact of delayed reporting in its selection of assumed loss development factors 

information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business this information which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies the company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the company the information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks 

following is a summary of the company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of december 31 2018 and 2017  

  

following is a summary of the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses by major line of business as of december 31 2018 and 2017  

  

 

 the company evaluates reserves for losses and loss expenses on a quarterly basis changes in estimates of prior year losses are reported when such changes are made the changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends 

certain of the companys insurance and reinsurance contracts are retrospectively rated whereby the company collects more or less premiums based on the level of loss activity for those contracts changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years may be fully or partially offset by additional or return premiums

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 39 million in 2018

for professional liability business adverse development was primarily related to unexpected large directors and officers “do” liability losses at one of our us operating units as well as lawyers professional liability losses at another operating unit the adverse development stemmed primarily from accident years 2015 and 2016 and was driven by a higher frequency of large losses than we had experienced in previous years

reinsurance  reserves for the reinsurance segment developed unfavorably by 31 million in 2017  this adverse development was due to reserve strengthening associated with claims impacted by the change in the ogden discount rate in the uk as well as adverse development on the us facultative casualty excess of loss business the ogden rate is the discount rate used to calculate lumpsum bodily injury payouts in the uk and was reduced by the uk ministry of justice from 25 to 075 in 2017 the adverse development mostly related to uk motor bodily injury claims which we reinsured on an excess of loss basis in accident years 2012 through 2016 the adverse development on us facultative casualty business was due to construction related risks in accident years 2008 and prior

fixed maturity securities – for securities that we intend to sell or more likely than not would be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be otti the amount of otti is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value at the balance sheet date for securities that we do not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an otti if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security ie the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 

the portion of the decline in value considered to be a credit loss ie the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security is recognized in earnings the portion of the decline in value not considered to be a credit loss ie the difference in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value of the security is recognized in other comprehensive income

fair value measurements  the company’s fixed maturity available for sale securities equity securities and its trading account securities are carried at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available the fair value of the vast majority of the company’s portfolio is based on observable data other than quoted prices and accordingly is classified as level 2 

in classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy the company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable the company determines the 

existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information the company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers the uninterrupted availability of such inputs the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time if the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable the security is categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers and reference data quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions for publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable the company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data for securities traded only in private negotiations the company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer financial data projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information

observable data – if independent pricing is not available the company prices the securities directly prices are based on observable market data where available including current trading levels for similar securities and nonbinding quotations from brokers the company generally requests two or more quotes if more than one quote is received the company sets a price within the range of quotes received based on its assessment of the credibility of the quote and its own evaluation of the security the company generally does not adjust quotes obtained from brokers since these securities were priced based on observable data they were classified as level 2 

cash flow model – if the above methodologies are not available the company prices securities using a discounted cash flow model based upon assumptions as to prevailing credit spreads interest rates and interest rate volatility time to maturity and subordination levels discount rates are adjusted to reflect illiquidity where appropriate these securities were classified as level 3

investments

the company also attempts to maintain an appropriate relationship between the effective duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities ie policy claims and debt obligations the effective duration of the investment portfolio was 28 years and 30 years at december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively the company’s investment portfolio and investmentrelated assets as of december 31 2018 were as follows 

   



fixed maturity securities  the company’s investment policy with respect to fixed maturity securities is generally to purchase instruments with the expectation of holding them to their maturity however management of the available for sale portfolio is considered necessary to maintain an approximate matching of assets and liabilities as well as to adjust the portfolio as a result of changes in financial market conditions and tax considerations 

the company’s philosophy related to holding or selling fixed maturity securities is based on its objective of maximizing total return the key factors that management considers in its investment decisions as to whether to hold or sell fixed maturity securities are its view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as its expectations regarding interest rates credit spreads and currency values in a period in which management expects interest rates to rise the company may sell longer duration securities in order to mitigate the impact of an interest rate rise on the fair value of the portfolio similarly in a period in which management expects credit spreads to widen the company may sell lower quality securities and in a period in which management expects certain foreign currencies to decline in value the company may sell securities denominated in those foreign currencies the sale of fixed maturity securities in order to achieve the objective of maximizing total return may result in realized gains however there is no reason to expect these gains to continue in future periods

liquidity and capital resources

the companys insurance subsidiaries principal sources of cash are premiums investment income service fees and proceeds from sales and maturities of portfolio investments the principal uses of cash are payments for claims taxes operating expenses and dividends the company expects its insurance subsidiaries to fund the payment of losses with cash received from premiums investment income and fees the company generally targets an average duration for its investment portfolio that is within one year of the average duration of its liabilities so that portions of its investment portfolio mature throughout the claim cycle and are available for the payment of claims if necessary in the event operating cash flow and proceeds from maturities and prepayments of fixed income securities are not sufficient to fund claim payments and other cash requirements the remainder of the companys cash and investments is available to pay claims and other obligations as they become due the companys investment portfolio is highly liquid with approximately 78 invested in cash cash equivalents and marketable fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2018 if the sale of fixed maturity securities were to become necessary a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the cost and sales price of securities sold would be recognized

reinsurance 

the company follows customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its exposures in exchange for paying reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies it writes reinsurance is purchased by the company principally to reduce its net liability on individual risks and to protect it against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage the company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and attempts to place its coverages only with financially sound carriers reinsurance coverage and retentions vary depending on the line of business location of the risk and nature of loss the company’s reinsurance purchases include the following 

 the company places a number of its casualty treaties on a “risk attaching” basis under risk attaching treaties all claims from policies incepting during the period of the reinsurance contract are covered even if they occur after the expiration date of the reinsurance contract if the company is unable to renew or replace its existing reinsurance coverage protection for unexpired policies would remain in place until their expiration in such case the company could revise its underwriting strategy for new business to reflect the absence of reinsurance protection the casualty catastrophe treaty highlighted above was purchased on a claims made basis property catastrophe and workers’ compensation catastrophe reinsurance is generally placed on a “losses occurring basis” whereby only claims occurring during the period are covered if the company is unable to renew or replace these reinsurance coverages unexpired policies would not be protected though we frequently have the option to purchase runoff coverage in our treaties

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk  the fair value of the company’s investments is subject to risks of fluctuations in credit quality and interest rates the company uses various models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage interest rate risk the company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate relationship between the effective duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities ie policy claims and debt obligations the effective duration for the fixed maturity portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was 28 years and 30 years at december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively

the following table outlines the groups of fixed maturity securities and their effective duration at december 31 2018  



duration is a common measure of the price sensitivity of fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates the company determines the estimated change in fair value of the fixed maturity securities assuming parallel shifts in 

the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static the estimated fair value at specified levels at december 31 2018 would be as follows 



arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less the company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies including short sales 

additionally the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options selling call options or entering into swap contracts the companys merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks

loss and loss expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among others historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made although the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements 

represent management’s best estimates setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

the company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves the amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was 1855 million and 1907 million at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the aggregate net discount for those reserves after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 591 million and 640 million at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively at december 31 2017  discount rates by year ranged from 20 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 38 

substantially all discounted workers’ compensation reserves 97 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2017  are excess workers’ compensation reserves in order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period once established no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized the expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the company’s loss payout experience 

the company also discounts reserves for certain other longduration workers’ compensation reserves representing approximately 3 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2017  including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease these reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 

to date known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the company’s operations because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to significant environmental or asbestos exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language 

the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims on policies written before adoption of the absolute exclusion was 30 million at december 31 2017  and 31 million at december 31 2016  the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years 



 

   

also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 14 reserves for losses and loss expenses included in our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the decrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2017  as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” in the company’s us regulatory filings is as follows 

 

 

reinsurance 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

us regulation   

our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 

overview  our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums loss expenses and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

holding company statutes  in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations 

in addition we must annually submit to our lead state regulator an “enterprise risk management report” which identifies the activities and circumstances of any affiliated company that might have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our group or our us licensed insurers 

several states have also adopted changes to the holding company act that authorize us insurance regulators to lead or participate in the groupwide supervision of certain international insurance groups international standard setters such as the international association of insurance supervisors are developing capital standards for international groups and us insurance regulators are currently working on us group capital standards for insurance groups the us group capital calculation is expected to incorporate existing riskbased capital standards it is unclear how the development of group capital measures will interact with existing capital requirements for insurance companies in the united states and with international capital standards it is possible that we may be required to hold additional capital as a result of these developments 

most states have adopted the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act the “orsa model act” which requires an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an own risk and solvency assessment summary report “orsa” the orsa is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks under orsa we are required to 

 

 

cybersecurity regulations new york’s cybersecurity regulation for financial services institutions that are authorized by the new york state department of financial services part 500 including our insurance subsidiaries licensed in new york became effective on march 1 2017 the regulation which is being implemented in stages requires these entities to establish 

and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers’ private data and the confidentiality integrity and availability of the licensee’s information systems on october 24 2017 the naic adopted the insurance data security model law the “cybersecurity model law” which establishes standards for data security the investigation of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to or the misuse of certain nonpublic information and reporting to insurance commissioners the cybersecurity model law imposes significant new regulatory burdens intended to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of information systems its implementation will be based on adoption by state legislatures importantly the cybersecurity model law states that a licensee’s compliance with the new york cybersecurity regulation shall constitute compliance with the cybersecurity model law we made the initial certification as required by part 500 for licensed entities we cannot predict the impact if any that any proposed or future cybersecurity regulations will have on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risk based capital requirements  the naic utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the naic rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any rbc action level as of december 31 2017  

insurance regulatory information system the naic also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the insurance regulatory information system “iris” on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 

guaranty funds  our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and the insolvent companys available funds are insufficient to pay policyholders and claimants the amounts to which they are entitled the protection afforded under a states guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums in that state the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

additionally state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory propertyliability “shared market” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “fair” plans in addition some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 

dividends  we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

trade practices  state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers including provisions governing marketing and sales practices policyholder services claims management and complaint handling state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 

investment regulation investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind quality and concentration of investments in general these laws and regulations permit investments in federal state and municipal obligations corporate bonds preferred and common equity securities mortgage loans real estate and certain other investments subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications investments that do not comply with these limits and qualifications are deducted in our insurance subsidiaries calculation of their statutory capital and surplus 

terrorism risk insurance the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism pursuant to the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “tripra” the program has been extended for a six year period ending on december 31 2020 tripra provides a federal backstop to all us based property and casualty insurers for insurance 

related losses resulting from any act of terrorism on us soil or against certain us air carriers vessels or foreign missions tripra is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism tripras definition of certified acts includes domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tripra when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will currently pay 83 of an insurers covered losses in excess of the insurers applicable deductible this amount will decrease to 80 on a prorata basis over five years which began in 2017 the insurers deductible is based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2017 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2018 will be approximately 948 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 160 million industrywide for calendar year 2018 this threshold will increase to 200 million on a prorata basis over five years which began in 2016 tripra limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

excess and surplus lines  the regulation of our us subsidiaries excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business principally with respect to rates and policy forms strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 

federal regulation  although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act created two new federal government bodies the federal insurance office the “fio” and the financial stability oversight council the “fsoc” which may impact the regulation of insurance although the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements it does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance the fio has authority to represent the united states in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the us insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk the current administration and the republican party have expressed their desire to amend the doddfrank act on june 8 2017 the us house of representatives passed the financial choice act of 2017 which proposes to amend or repeal various sections of the doddfrank act this proposed legislation is under consideration by the us senate 

the doddfrank act authorizes the secretary of the treasury and us trade representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance a “covered agreement” on january 13 2017 the us department of treasury and the us trade representative announced the completion of covered agreement negotiations with the european union “eu” regarding the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance and provided the text of the covered agreement the covered agreement addresses three areas of prudential supervision reinsurance group supervision and the exchange of information between the us and eu 

the us and eu signed the covered agreement on september 22 2017 and each party has begun the process of completing its internal requirements and procedures such as amending or promulgating appropriate statutes and regulations in order for the covered agreement to enter into force under the covered agreement reinsurance collateral requirements will no longer apply to qualifying eu reinsurers that sell reinsurance to the us market and us reinsurers operating in the eu market will no longer be subject to “local presence” requirements the covered agreement establishes group supervision practices that apply only to us and eu insurance groups operating in both territories for instance the covered agreement provides that us insurance groups with operations in the eu will be supervised at the worldwide level only by us insurance regulators and precludes eu insurance supervisors from exercising solvency and capital requirements over the worldwide operations of us insurers 

us states have five years from the date of signature to remove collateral requirements for eu reinsurers that meet certain standards while eu member states have two years to revise their “local presence” laws under the doddfrank act the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with the covered agreement the fio is required to report to congress annually on the insurance industry and any preemption actions regarding any covered agreement 

the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure ie a systemically important financial institution an insurer so designated by fsoc will be subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards as of december 31 2017 one insurance group is subject to this supervision and heightened standards in 

november 2017 the us department of treasury issued a report recommending certain changes to fsoc’s process for designating nonbank financial companies as systemically significant in order to make the designation process more rigorous clear and transparent any suggested changes ultimately adopted by the fsoc would be implemented by fsoc directly rather than through legislation 

 based upon our current business model and balance sheet we do not believe that we will be designated by the fsoc as such an institution although the potential impacts of the doddfrank act its implementing regulations and potential amendments to the doddfrank act on the us insurance industry are not clear our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically important nonbank financial companies 

international regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by the prudential regulation authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca the pras primary objectives with regard to insurers are to promote the safety and soundness of insurers and to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for current and future policyholders while the fca has three operational objectives i to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers ii to protect and enhance the integrity of the united kingdom financial system and iii to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the financial services markets the pra and fca employ a variety of regulatory tools to achieve their objectives including periodic auditing and reporting requirements risk assessment reviews minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements dividend restrictions in certain cases approval requirements governing the appointment of key officers approval requirements governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements our lloyds managing agency is also regulated by the pra fca and lloyds and the lloyds syndicate business is subject to lloyds supervision through lloyds we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of lloyds international licenses in each such country we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country our insurance subsidiary based in liechtenstein is regulated by the financial market authority of liechtenstein which has regulatory tools analogous to those of the uk regulators noted above additionally uk and liechtenstein laws and regulations also impact us as “controllers” of our europeanregulated subsidiaries whereby we are required to notify the appropriate authorities about significant events relating to such regulated subsidiaries controllers ie persons or entities which have certain levels of direct or indirect voting power or economic interests in the regulated entities as well as changes of control and to submit annual reports regarding their controllers the prafcas senior insurance managers regime simr and the senior managers and certification regime which is intended to be extended to insurers thereby replacing the simr in late 2018 and analogous regulation in liechtenstein further provide regulatory frameworks for standards of fitness and propriety conduct and accountability for individuals in positions of responsibility at insurers in addition certain employees are individually registered at lloyds 

 our insurance business throughout the european union is subject to solvency ii an insurance regulatory regime governing among other things capital adequacy and risk management which became effective on january 1 2016 lloyd’s applies a capital adequacy test to all lloyd’s syndicates including our syndicate that is based on solvency ii principles solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency under solvency ii it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii currently the us system of insurance regulation relating to group supervision is not deemed equivalent to solvency ii by european union authorities however we have received a waiver from the pra subject to conditions with respect to the pras supervision of our group which waives the requirement on us to maintain a group solvency capital requirement as calculated under solvency ii rules the covered agreement also prohibits any eu supervisor from exercising groupwide supervision at any level above the highest company organized in the country of that supervisor 

we must also comply with the recently enacted european union general data protection regulation “gdpr” all eu member states must implement gdpr by may 2018 the regulation’s goal is to impose increased individual rights and protections for all personal data located in or originating from the eu gdpr is extraterritorial in that it applies to all business in the eu and any business outside the eu that process eu personal data of individuals in the eu moreover there are significant fines associated with noncompliance 

our international operations are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in mexico australia and canada and in certain other countries in europe south america and southeast asia generally our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements while each country imposes licensing solvency auditing and financial reporting requirements the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially key areas where country regulations may differ include i the type of financial reports to be filed ii a requirement to use local intermediaries iii the amount of reinsurance permissible iv the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates and v the type and frequency of regulatory examinations 

competition   

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with many insurance companies of various sizes as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as selfinsured retentions or captive programs transacting business in the united states and internationally we compete directly with a large number of these companies competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our operating units can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our operating units establish their own pricing practices based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit 

competition for the insurance business within the united states comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers our specialty operating units compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers other regional units compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers additionally direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional units by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company our insurance operations compete internationally with native insurance operations both large and small which in some cases are related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

competition for the reinsurance business which is especially strong comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance partner re and others 

 in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties in demand and pricing causing cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business in recent years we have faced increased competition in our business as a result of new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share resulting in decreased premium rates and less favorable contract terms and conditions for certain lines of business the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return have impacted rate adequacy with interest rates remaining at or near historic lows these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which have reduced premium rates in certain areas and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume   

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided including ease of doing business over the internet speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written in recent years the insurance industry has undergone increasing consolidation which may further increase competition 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial andor marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers 

over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business as increased supply has led to reduced prices and at times less favorable terms and conditions our es operating units have also encountered competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share although insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business since 2011 the rate of increase has declined in more recent years loss costs have also increased over that period of time with the low level of interest rates available current price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for us to achieve our longterm return objectives we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and as a result pressure on pricing and policy terms and conditions 

in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively in addition technology companies or other third parties have created and may in the future create digitallyenabled business models platforms or alternate distribution channels that may adversely impact our competitive position 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves   

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately  117 billion  as of december 31 2017  our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on managements assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions both inflation overall and medical cost inflation which has historically been greater than inflation overall can have an adverse impact 

reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain   

as industry practices and economic legal judicial social and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include but are not limited to 

 in some instances these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies as a result the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued 

in addition the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue to remove limitations on recovery to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business 

the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes   

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results for example catastrophe losses net of reinsurance recoveries were 184 million in 2017  105 million in 2016  58 million in 2015  87 million in 2014  and 65 million in 2013  similarly manmade catastrophes can also have a material impact on our financial results 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes tsunamis hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist and other manmade activities including drilling mining and other industrial accidents cyber events or terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changing climate conditions may increase the frequency and severity of catastrophic events and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results 

over the past several years changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming appear to have contributed to the unpredictability frequency and severity of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures there is a growing scientific consensus that global warming and other climate change are increasing the frequency and severity of catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods and other natural disasters such changes make it more difficult for us to predict and model catastrophic events reducing our ability to accurately price our exposure to such events and mitigate our risks any increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters may adversely affect our financial condition and results 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts   

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “tripra” for up to 83 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2017  earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2018  is approximately 948 million tripra is currently in effect through december 31 2020 in addition the coverage provided under tripra does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business   

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered in the united states by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

 state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters our insurance business internationally is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations outside the united states 

federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to conditions in the financial markets global insurance supervision and other factors may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 

the doddfrank act effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” which is authorized to recommend that certain 

systemically significant nonbank financial companies including insurance companies be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve the doddfrank act also established a federal insurance office “fio” which is authorized to study monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure the potential impact of the doddfrank act on the us insurance business is not clear our business could be affected by changes whether as a result of the doddfrank act or otherwise to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

one insurance group is subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards as a systematically significant financial institution 

the current administration and the republican party have expressed their desire to amend the doddfrank act on june 8 2017 the us house of representatives passed the financial choice act of 2017 which proposes to amend or repeal various sections of the doddfrank act this proposed legislation is under consideration by the us senate we are not able to predict whether any such proposal to amend or repeal certain sections of the doddfrank act would have a material effect on our business operations and cannot identify the risks if any that may be posed to our businesses as a result of changes to or legislative replacements for the doddfrank act 

although state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in the united states in addition to the changes brought about by the doddfrank act congress has considered various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarranferguson act and tax law changes we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution in addition the current administration and the volatile political environment may increase the chance of other federal legislative and regulatory changes that could affect us in ways we cannot predict 

with respect to international measures solvency ii the eu regime concerning the capital adequacy risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers may affect our insurance businesses implementation of solvency ii in eu member states occurred on january 1 2016 and as the solvency ii regime evolves over time we may be required to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance in addition despite the waiver of the solvency ii group capital requirements we received solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers additionally our capital requirements and compliance requirements may be adversely affected if the eu commission does not deem the insurance regulatory regimes of the jurisdictions outside the eu in which we have insurance or reinsurance companies domiciled to be equivalent to solvency ii 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may further restrict the conduct of our business 

risks relating to our business 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america canada mexico scandinavia the asiapacific region africa and australia expose us to increased investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our investments in nonusdenominated assets are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

the united kingdom leaving the european union eu could adversely affect our business 

the 2016 uk referendum on its membership in the eu resulted in a majority of uk voters voting in favor of the uk leaving the eu “brexit” on march 29 2017 the uk government formally notified the european council of the uk’s intention to withdraw from the eu the member withdrawal provisions in the eu treaty provide that the uk and the eu will negotiate a withdrawal agreement during a maximum twoyear period unless such period is extended by unanimous vote of the 

eu member states as part of the sequenced approach to the talks set out by the eu sufficient progress needs to be made on the withdrawal arrangements before any talks on a future trade deal between the eu and the uk can begin depending on the terms of the withdrawal agreement the uk could lose access to the single eu market and to free trade deals with several countries that already have agreements with the eu such a decline in trade could affect the attractiveness of the uk and impact our uk business we also face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences related to brexit including with respect to volatility in financial markets exchange rates and interest rates these uncertainties could increase the volatility of or reduce our investment results in particular periods or over time brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and differing laws and regulations between the uk and the eu any of these potential effects and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our president and ceo executive chairman senior executive officers presidents of our operating units experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new products and markets 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses   

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2017  the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 1783 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

we are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders independent agents and brokers 

in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business including credit risk relating to policyholders independent agents and brokers for example our policyholders independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds 

as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn while we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms our efforts may not be successful for example to reduce such credit risk we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us in cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged andor the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit 

we are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poors or moodys our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a ratings downgrade could also adversely limit our access to capital markets which may increase the cost of debt a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

if conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable which may result from disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so on terms acceptable to us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience difficulties with our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems our ability to conduct our business could be negatively or severely impacted   

our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe terrorist attack or industrial accident or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if our business continuity plans or system security does not sufficiently address such a business interruption system failure or service denial our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed 

failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability  

our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks computer viruses hackers employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches our electronic transmission of personal confidential and proprietary information to third parties with whom we have business relationships and our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security while we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these thirdparty vendors and others with whom we do business our vendors and third parties could still suffer data breaches that could result in the exposure of sensitive data and the infiltration of our computer systems our failure to protect sensitive personal and our proprietary information whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors could result in significant monetary and reputational damages these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs as a result our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective   

our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting claim processing and investment activities many of which are highly complex these activities often are subject to internal 

guidelines and policies as well as legal and regulatory standards including those related to privacy anticorruption antibribery and global finance and insurance matters our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance that the control systems objectives will be met if our controls are not effective it could lead to financial loss unanticipated risk exposure including underwriting credit and investment risk or damage to our reputation 

we could be adversely affected by recent and future changes in us federal income tax laws 

recent tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 fundamentally overhauls the us tax system by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax limiting the deductibility of business interest expense introducing a base erosion and antiavoidance tax aimed at crossborder deductible payments to related foreign persons moving closer to a territorial system of taxing earnings generated through foreign subsidiaries and imposing a onetime deemed repatriation tax on certain post1986 undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the context of the taxation of us propertycasualty insurance companies such as the company the act would also modify the loss reserve discounting rules and the proration rules that apply to reduce reserve deductions to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate although we believe that the changes introduced by the act should generally benefit us we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the act and its implementing regulations in addition it is possible that other legislation could be introduced and enacted by the current congress or future congresses that could have an adverse impact on us new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying provisions of the act may be forthcoming we cannot predict if when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect or their potential impact on us 

risks relating to our investments   

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations   

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2017  our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 136 billion or 736 of our total investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 28 state and municipal securities 332 corporate securities 324 assetbacked securities 156 mortgagebacked securities 97 and foreign government 63 

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise if significant inflation or an increase in interest rates were to occur the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would be negatively impacted conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations additionally given the near historically low interest rate environment we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals 

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession during periods of market disruption it may be difficult to value certain of our securities particularly if trading becomes less frequent andor market data becomes less observable there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment in such cases more securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment 

although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue many states and municipalities operate under deficits or projected deficits the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuers ability to perform its obligations thereunder additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the continued low inflation actions by the federal reserve economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we have invested a portion of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets which are subject to significant volatility and may decline in value 

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets at december 31 2017  our investment in these assets was approximately 39 billion or 212 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents 

merger and arbitrage trading securities were 618 million or 34 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2017  merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

real estate related investments including directly owned investment funds and loans receivable were 22 billion or 117 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2017  we also invest in aviation and rail equipment funds creditrelated funds and energy and other investment funds the values of these investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and the related asset valuations in particular in addition our investments in real estate related assets and other alternative investments are less liquid than our other investments 

these investments are subject to significant volatility as a result of the conditions in the financial and commodity markets and the global economy 

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts 

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries during 2018  the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 699 million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations pay dividends or repurchase shares 

laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable and may restrict a stockholders ability to purchase our common stock 

generally united states insurance holding   company laws require that before a person can acquire control of an insurance company prior written approval   must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is   domiciled pursuant to applicable laws and regulations “control” over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person   directly or indirectly owns controls holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 or more of   the voting securities of that insurer or any parent company of such insurer indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock thus   the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled are likely to   apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common   stock some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to   make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates on the one hand and the target   insurer and its affiliates on the other hand have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state additionally many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements 

these provisions can also lead to the imposition of conditions on an   acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation   these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control   of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might   consider to be desirable 

certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 

these provisions include 

 these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

overview 

w r berkley corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the united states and operates worldwide in two business segments of the property and casualty business insurance and reinsurance our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches it also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics while providing our business units with certain operating autonomy our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital investment reinsurance and enterprise risk management and actuarial financial and corporate legal staff support the companys primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments

the profitability of the company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time an insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural and other disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses general insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity ie the level of statutory capital and surplus employed in the industry and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital 

the company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income and investment gains the company’s invested assets are invested principally in fixed maturity securities the return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities returns available on fixed maturity investments have been at historically low levels in recent years 

the company also invests in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds including energy related funds private equity loans and real estate related assets the companys investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced and the company expects to continue to experience greater fluctuations in investment income 

during 2017 catastrophe losses were 184 million mainly related to hurricanes harvey irma and maria two earthquakes in mexico and wildfires in california 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act provides for a reduction of the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 the tax act also provides for a mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings which requires companies to pay a onetime tax on the unremitted accumulated earnings of their foreign subsidiaries the company has calculated the effects of the tax act as of december 31 2017 and has included in its financial statements provisional estimates of its impact the company anticipates further guidance will be forthcoming and will continue to review and refine its calculations as guidance is provided and additional analysis of the companys information is completed 

in 2017 the company reported a net tax benefit related to the tax act in the amount of 207 million  this included a tax benefit due to the reduction of the tax rate as applied to the net us deferred tax liability in the amount of 305 million  offsetting this tax benefit the company recorded a provisional charge of 98 million  on the deemed repatriation of earnings and related impact of utilization of foreign losses the charge may be adjusted as the applicable earnings related to the foreign subsidiaries are finalized for the purpose of the mandatory repatriation inclusion computation 

commencing with the first quarter 2017 the company reclassified two businesses from the insurance segment to the reinsurance segment reclassifications have been made to the companys 2016 and earlier presented financial information to conform with this presentation 

critical accounting estimates 

the following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses assumed premiums and otherthantemporary impairments of investments management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments 

reserves for losses and loss expenses    to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among other things historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent a certain calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to uncertainty these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations the company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each operating unit these methods include paid loss development incurred loss development paid and incurred bornhuetterferguson methods and frequency and severity methods in circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others that method is used to set the point estimate for example the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data for new lines of business where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods the actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered industry loss experience is used to supplement the company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the company’s own data is limited the actuarial data is analyzed by line of business coverage and accident or policy year as appropriate for each operating unit 

the establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses these qualitative considerations include among others the impact of reunderwriting initiatives changes in the mix of business changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits the expansion of coverage exclusions whether or not defense costs are within policy limits and changes in deductibles and attachment points 

the key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is priced and written before any actual claims experience has emerged this expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each operating unit expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the longtail lines such as excess casualty and claims with a high medical component such as workers’ compensation reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses and are derived from the company’s own experience and industry data the paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred however different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates 

loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves including expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits retentions rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 

another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses less ibnr is required for lines with short reporting lags as a result loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates for lines with short reporting lags which include commercial automobile primary workers’ compensation other liability claimsmade and property business the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date for lines of business with long reporting lags which include other liability occurrence products liability excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider historically the company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags 

the key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the latest reported loss data current trends and other factors observed if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate the following table reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity relative to our assumptions on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2017  



our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 101 billion as of december 31 2017  relate to multiple accident years therefore the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above the impact of such changes would likely be manifested gradually over the course of many years as the magnitude of the changes became evident 

approximately 17 billion or 17 of the company’s net loss reserves as of december 31 2017  relate to the reinsurance segment there is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of assumed loss reserves because those estimates are based in part upon information received from ceding companies if information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct the company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate furthermore due to delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is extended management considers the impact of delayed reporting in its selection of assumed loss development factors 

information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business this information which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies the company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the company the information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks 

following is a summary of the company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of december 31 2017  and 2016  

  

following is a summary of the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses by major line of business as of december 31 2017  and 2016  

  

 

 the company evaluates reserves for losses and loss expenses on a quarterly basis changes in estimates of prior year losses are reported when such changes are made the changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends 

certain of the companys insurance and reinsurance contracts are retrospectively rated whereby the company collects more or less premiums based on the level of loss activity for those contracts changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years may be fully or partially offset by additional or return premiums 

net prior year development ie the sum of prior year reserve changes and prior year earned premiums changes for each of the last three years ended december 31 are as follows 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 37 million in 2017  

insurance    reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 68 million in 2017 the favorable development was primarily attributable to workers compensation business and was partially offset by unfavorable development for professional liability business 

for workers compensation the favorable development was related to both primary and excess business and was spread across many accident years including those prior to 2008 but was most significant in accident years 2014 through 2016 the favorable workers compensation development reflects a continuation during 2017 of the generally benign loss cost trends experienced in recent years particularly the favorable claim frequency trends ie number of reported claims per unit of exposure reported workers compensation losses in 2017 continued to be below our expectations at most of our operating units and were below the assumptions underlying our previous reserve estimates the favorable severity trends were also impacted by our continued investment in medical case management services and the higher usage of preferred provider networks the long term trend of declining workers compensation frequency can be attributed to improved workplace safety 

for professional liability business adverse development was primarily related to unexpected large directors  officers do liability losses at one of our us operating units and large professional indemnity and do losses in the uk the adverse development stemmed mainly from accident years 2013 through 2016 in the us and 2011 through 2016 in the uk 

reinsurance    reserves for the reinsurance segment developed unfavorably by 31 million in 2017 this adverse development was due to reserve strengthening associated with claims impacted by the change in the ogden discount rate in the uk as well as adverse development on the us facultative casualty excess of loss business the ogden rate is the discount rate used to calculate lumpsum bodily injury payouts in the uk and was reduced by the uk ministry of justice from 25 to 075 in 2017 the adverse development mostly related to uk motor bodily injury claims which we reinsured on an excess of loss basis in accident years 2012 through 2016 the adverse development on us facultative casualty business was due to construction related risks in accident years 2008 and prior 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 59 million in 2016  

insurance    reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 53 million in 2016  the favorable development was primarily related to workers compensation business and was partially offset by unfavorable development for medical professional liability business 

for workers compensation the favorable development was related to both primary and excess business and to many accident years including those prior to 2007 during 2016  reported workers compensation losses continued to be below our expectations at most of our operating units loss frequency and severity trends continued to be better than the assumptions underlying our previous reserve estimates loss severity trends also benefited from our continued investment in medical case management services and from our preferred provider networks the long term trend of declining workers compensation frequency can be attributed to improved workplace safety 

for medical professional liability business unfavorable development was primarily related to a class of business that has been discontinued the adverse development for that business stemmed mainly from accident years 2010 through 2015 

reinsurance    reserves for the reinsurance segment developed favorably by 6 million in 2016  the favorable development was primarily related to direct facultative reinsurance business and to accident years 2008 through 2014 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 63 million in 2015  

insurance   reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 52 million in 2015  the favorable development was primarily related to workers compensation other liability business and commercial property and was partially offset by unfavorable development for commercial automobile liability business and professional indemnity business 

for workers compensation the favorable development was related to both primary and excess business and to many accident years including those prior to 2007 in 2015  reported workers compensation losses were below our expectations for many of our operating units in addition overall loss frequency and severity trends emerged better than the assumptions underlying our previous reserve estimates the long term trend of declining workers compensation claim frequency continued in 2015  the improvement is attributable to better workplace safety and to benign medical severity trends as we continue to invest in medical case management services and higher usage of preferred provider networks 

for other liability business favorable development was concentrated in accident years 2007 through 2013 the favorable development was primarily related to our excess and surplus lines casualty business that has benefited from a persistent improvement in claim frequency trends over the past several years 

for commercial property business favorable development was attributable to accident years 2012 through 2014 and was driven by favorable frequency and severity trends on property business written in lloyds 

for commercial automobile business adverse development was primarily related to large losses for longhaul trucking business and to accident years 2011 through 2014 the higher loss cost trends for the commercial automobile industry are attributable in part to the increase in miles driven as the economy improved and fuel prices declined over the past several years 

for professional indemnity business in the uk adverse development was primarily for accident years 2006 through 2013 

reinsurance     reserves for the reinsurance segment developed favorably by 11 million in 2015  the favorable development was primarily related to direct facultative reinsurance business and to accident years 2005 through 2013 loss reserves developed favorably for umbrella business and for other liability coverage for contractors 

reserve discount  the company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves the amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was  1855 million  and  1907 million  at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively the aggregate net discount for those reserves after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 591 million  and 640 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016 respectively at december 31 2017  discount rates by year ranged from 20  to 65  with a weighted average discount rate of 38  

substantially all discounted workers’ compensation reserves  97  of total discounted reserves at december 31 2017  are excess workers’ compensation reserves in order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period once established no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized the expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the company’s loss payout experience 

the company also discounts reserves for certain other longduration workers’ compensation reserves representing approximately 3  of total discounted reserves at december 31 2017  including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease these reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 

assumed reinsurance premiums  the company estimates the amount of assumed reinsurance premiums that it will receive under treaty reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contracts these premium estimates are revised as the actual amount of assumed premiums is reported to the company by the ceding companies as estimates of assumed premiums are made or revised the related amount of earned premiums commissions and incurred losses associated with those premiums are recorded estimated assumed premiums receivable were approximately 56 million and 68 million at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the assumed premium estimates are based upon terms set forth in reinsurance agreements information received from ceding companies during the underwriting and negotiation of agreements reports received from ceding companies and discussions and correspondence with reinsurance intermediaries the company also considers its own view of market conditions economic trends and experience with similar lines of business these premium estimates represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate amount of premiums to be received under its assumed reinsurance agreements 

otherthantemporary impairments otti of investments  the cost of securities is adjusted where appropriate to include a provision for decline in value which is considered to be otherthantemporary an otherthantemporary decline is considered to occur in investments where there has been a sustained reduction in fair value and where the company does not expect the fair value to recover prior to the time of sale or maturity since equity securities do not have a contractual cash flow or maturity the company considers whether the price of an equity security is expected to recover within a reasonable period of time 

the company classifies its fixed maturity securities and preferred stocks by credit rating primarily based on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies for purposes of classifying securities with different ratings the company uses the average of the credit ratings assigned unless in limited situations the companys own analysis indicates an internal rating is more appropriate securities that are not rated by a rating agency are evaluated and classified by the company on a casebycase basis 

fixed maturity securities  – for securities that we intend to sell or more likely than not would be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be otti the amount of otti is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value at the balance sheet date for securities that we do not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an otti if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security ie the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 

the portion of the decline in value considered to be a credit loss ie the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security is recognized in earnings the portion of the decline in value not considered to be a credit loss ie the difference in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value of the security is recognized in other comprehensive income 

impairment assessments for structured securities including mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities collateralized debt obligations and corporate debt are generally evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios that may involve subjective judgments and estimates by management modeling these securities involves various factors such as projected default rates the nature and realizable value of the collateral if any the ability of the issuer to make scheduled payments historical performance and other relevant economic and performance factors if an otti determination is made a discounted cash flow analysis is used to ascertain the amount of the credit impairment 

the following table provides a summary of fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position as of december 31 2017  



a summary of the company’s noninvestment grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2017  is presented in the table below 

  

the company has evaluated its fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and believes the unrealized loss is due primarily to temporary market and sectorrelated factors rather than to issuerspecific factors none of these securities are delinquent or in default under financial covenants based on its assessment of these issuers the company expects them to continue to meet their contractual payment obligations as they become due and does not consider any of these securities to be otti for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016 there were no otti for fixed maturity securities recognized in earnings 

preferred stocks    – at december 31 2017  there was one  preferred stock in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of 231 million  and a gross unrealized loss of 26 million  the preferred stock is rated investment grade management believes the unrealized loss is due primarily to market and sector related factors and does not consider it to be otti for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016 there were no otti for preferred stocks 

common stocks  – at december 31 2017  there were three common stocks in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of 186 million and a gross unrealized loss of 20 million based on managements view of these securities the company does not consider the common stocks to be otti for the year ended december 31 2017  there were no otti for common stocks otti for common stocks for the year ended december 31 2016  were 181 million 

loans receivable  – the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable including current market conditions for each loan and the ability to collect principal and interest for loans where the company determines it is probable that the contractual terms will not be met an analysis is performed and a valuation reserve is established if necessary with a charge to earnings loans receivable are reported net of a valuation reserve of 3 million for both december 31 2017  and 2016  

the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable and assesses the ability of each borrower to pay principal and interest based upon loan structure underlying property values cash flow and related financial and operating performance of the property and market conditions loans receivable with a potential for default are further assessed using discounted cash flow analysis and comparable cost and sales methodologies if appropriate 

fair value measurements    the company’s fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale and its trading account securities are carried at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available the fair value of the vast majority of the company’s portfolio is based on observable data other than quoted prices and accordingly is classified as level 2 

in classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy the company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable the company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information the company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers the uninterrupted availability of such inputs the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time if the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable the security is categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers and reference data quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions for publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable the company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data for securities traded only in private negotiations the company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer financial data projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information 

the following is a summary of pricing sources for the companys fixed maturity securities available for sale as of december 31 2017  

  

independent pricing services   substantially all of the company’s fixed maturity securities available for sale were priced by independent pricing services generally one us pricing service plus additional pricing services with respect to a limited number of foreign securities held by the company the prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets eg broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities the determination of whether markets are active or inactive is based upon the volume and level of activity for a particular asset class the company reviews the prices provided by pricing services for reasonableness based upon current trading levels for similar securities if the prices appear unusual to the company they are reexamined and the value is either confirmed or revised in addition the company periodically performs independent price tests of a sample of securities to ensure proper 

valuation and to verify our understanding of how securities are priced as of december 31 2017  the company did not make any adjustments to the prices provided by the pricing services based upon the company’s review of the methodologies used by the independent pricing services these securities were classified as level 2 

syndicate manager  – the company has a 15 participation in a lloyd’s syndicate and the company’s share of the securities owned by the syndicate is priced by the syndicate’s manager the majority of the securities are liquid short duration fixed maturity securities the company reviews the syndicate manager’s pricing methodology and audited financial statements and holds discussions with the syndicate manager as necessary to confirm its understanding and agreement with security prices based upon the company’s review of the methodologies used by the syndicate manager these securities were classified as level 2 

observable data  – if independent pricing is not available the company prices the securities directly prices are based on observable market data where available including current trading levels for similar securities and nonbinding quotations from brokers the company generally requests two or more quotes if more than one quote is received the company sets a price within the range of quotes received based on its assessment of the credibility of the quote and its own evaluation of the security the company generally does not adjust quotes obtained from brokers since these securities were priced based on observable data they were classified as level 2 

cash flow model  – if the above methodologies are not available the company prices securities using a discounted cash flow model based upon assumptions as to prevailing credit spreads interest rates and interest rate volatility time to maturity and subordination levels discount rates are adjusted to reflect illiquidity where appropriate these securities were classified as level 3

net income to common stockholders  the following table presents the company’s net income to common stockholders and net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  



the company reported net income of 549 million in 2017  compared to 602 million in 2016  the 9 decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in aftertax underwriting income of 98 million mainly driven by increased catastrophe losses from hurricanes harvey irma and maria two earthquakes in mexico and wildfires in california an aftertax increase of 18 million in net foreign currency losses an aftertax decrease in income from noninsurance businesses of 9 million an increase in aftertax interest expense of 4 million and an increase in aftertax other expenses of 7 million partially offset by an increase in aftertax net investment gains of 45 million a net benefit from tax reform of 21 million an increase in aftertax net investment income of 8 million an aftertax increase of 3 million in service fee income and an increase in income from other various sources of 6 million the number of weighted average diluted shares remained relatively unchanged for 2017  and 2016  

premiums  gross premiums written were 7477 million in 2017  a decrease of 1 from 7544 million in 2016  the decrease was due to a decrease in the reinsurance segment of 141 million partially offset by an increase in the insurance segment of 74 million approximately 79 of policies expiring in 2017  were renewed and 77 of policies expiring in 2016  were renewed 

average renewal premium rates adjusted for change in exposures increased 09 in 2017  03 in 2016  and 12 in 2015  however overall loss costs are also increasing and current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its longterm return objectives 

a summary of gross premiums written in 2017  compared with 2016  by line of business within each business segment follows 

 net premiums written were 6261 million in 2017  a decrease of 3 from 6424 million in 2016  ceded reinsurance premiums as a percentage of gross written premiums were 16 in 2017  and 15 in 2016

the company’s philosophy related to holding or selling fixed maturity securities is based on its objective of maximizing total return the key factors that management considers in its investment decisions as to whether to hold or sell fixed maturity securities are its view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as its expectations regarding interest rates credit spreads and currency values in a period in which management expects interest rates to rise the company may sell longer duration securities in order to mitigate the impact of an interest rate rise on the fair value of the portfolio similarly in a period in which management expects credit spreads to widen the company may sell lower quality securities and in a period in which management expects certain foreign currencies to decline in value the company may sell securities denominated in those foreign currencies the sale of fixed maturity securities in order to achieve the objective of maximizing total return may result in realized gains however there is no reason to expect these gains to continue in future periods

 the company places a number of its casualty treaties on a “risk attaching” basis under risk attaching treaties all claims from policies incepting during the period of the reinsurance contract are covered even if they occur after the expiration date of the reinsurance contract if the company is unable to renew or replace its existing reinsurance coverage protection for unexpired policies would remain in place until their expiration in such case the company could revise its underwriting strategy for new business to reflect the absence of reinsurance protection the casualty catastrophe treaty highlighted above was purchased on a claims made basis property catastrophe and workers’ compensation catastrophe reinsurance is generally placed on a “losses occurring basis” whereby only claims occurring during the period are covered if the company is unable to renew or replace these reinsurance coverages unexpired policies would not be protected though we frequently have the option to purchase runoff coverage in our treaties

arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less the company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies including short sales 

additionally the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options selling call options or entering into swap contracts the companys merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks

loss and loss expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among others historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made although the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements 

represent management’s best estimates setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

the company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves the amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was 1907 million and 2308 million at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the aggregate net discount for those reserves after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 640 million and 699 million at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively at december 31 2016  discount rates by year ranged from 20 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 39 

substantially all of discounted workers’ compensation reserves 97 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2016  are excess workers’ compensation reserves in order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period once established no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized the expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the company’s loss payout experience 

the company also discounts reserves for certain other longduration workers’ compensation reserves representing approximately 3 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2016  including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease these reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 

to date known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the company’s operations because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to significant environmental or asbestos exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language 

the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims on policies written before adoption of the absolute exclusion was 31 million at december 31 2016 and 33 million at december 31 2015 the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

  

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years 



 

   

also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 14 reserves for losses and loss expenses included in our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the decrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2016  as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” in the company’s us regulatory filings is as follows 

 

1 for statutory purposes the company discounts its workers’ compensation reinsurance reserves at 22  as permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware in its gaap financial statements the company discounts excess workers’ compensation reserves at the riskfree rate and assumed workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate 

reinsurance 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

us regulation   

our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 

overview  our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums loss expenses and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

holding company statutes  in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations 

in addition we must annually submit to our lead state regulator an “enterprise risk management report” which identifies the activities and circumstances of any affiliated company that might have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our group or our us licensed insurers 

several states have also adopted changes to the holding company act that authorize us insurance regulators to lead or participate in the groupwide supervision of certain international insurance groups international standard setters such as the international association of insurance supervisors are developing capital standards for international groups and us insurance regulators are currently working on us group capital standards for insurance groups the us group capital calculation is expected to incorporate existing riskbased capital standards it is unclear how the development of group capital measures will interact with existing capital requirements for insurance companies in the united states and with international capital standards it is possible that we may be required to hold additional capital as a result of these developments 

most states have adopted the national association of insurance commissionerss “naic” risk management and own risk solvency assessment model act the “orsa model act” which requires an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an own risk and solvency assessment summary report “orsa” the orsa is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks under orsa we are required to 

 

 

the naic is working on an insurance data security model law which would require insurers insurance producers and other entities required to be licensed under state insurance laws to develop and maintain a written information security program conduct risk assessments and oversee the data security practices of thirdparty vendors in addition the new york department of financial services has adopted a cybersecurity regulation that would impose significant new regulatory burdens on companies they supervise including entities doing business in new york and operating or required to operate under a license registration certificate accreditation or similar authorization the regulation which will become effective on march 1 2017 would require any such company to maintain a cybersecurity program meeting certain core functions adopt a cybersecurity policy and oversee the cybersecurity practices of thirdparty service providers among other requirements 

we cannot predict the impact if any that these holding company statutes and compliance with the orsa model act or any proposed or future cybersecurity regulations will have on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risk based capital requirements  the naic utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the naic rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any rbc action level as of december 31 2016 

insurance regulatory information system the naic also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the insurance regulatory information system “iris” on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 

guaranty funds  our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and the insolvent companys available funds are insufficient to pay policyholders and claimants the amounts to which they are entitled the protection afforded under a states guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums in that state the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

additionally state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory propertyliability “shared market” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “fair” plans in addition some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 

dividends  we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

trade practices  state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers including provisions governing marketing and sales practices policyholder services claims management and complaint handling state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 

investment regulation investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind quality and concentration of investments in general these laws and regulations permit investments in federal state and municipal obligations corporate bonds preferred and common equity securities mortgage loans real estate and certain other investments subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications investments that do not comply with these limits and qualifications are deducted in our insurance subsidiaries calculation of their statutory capital and surplus 

terrorism risk insurance the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism pursuant to the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “tripra” the program has been extended for a six year period ending 

on december 31 2020 tripra provides a federal backstop to all us based property and casualty insurers for insurance related losses resulting from any act of terrorism on us soil or against certain us air carriers vessels or foreign missions tripra is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism tripras definition of certified acts includes domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tripra when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will currently pay 84 of an insurers covered losses in excess of the insurers applicable deductible this amount will decrease to 80 on a prorata basis over five years beginning in 2017 the insurers deductible is based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2016 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2017 will be approximately 915 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 140 million industrywide for calendar year 2017 this threshold will increase to 200 million on a prorata basis over five years beginning in 2016 tripra limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

excess and surplus lines  the regulation of our us subsidiaries excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business principally with respect to rates and policy forms strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 

federal regulation  although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act created two new federal government bodies the federal insurance office the “fio” and the financial stability oversight council the “fsoc” which may impact the regulation of insurance although the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements it does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance the fio has authority to represent the united states in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the us insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk 

the fio has a particular role in connection with international insurance matters the fio represents the us at the international association of insurance supervisors “iais” in 2016 the fio participated in iais’s financial stability committee and joined iais’s executive committee the doddfrank act authorizes the secretary of the treasury and us trade representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance a “covered agreement” on january 13 2017 the us department of treasury and the us trade representative notified the us congress as required under the doddfrank act that they had successfully negotiated a covered agreement with the european union “eu” the covered agreement addresses three areas of insurance regulation reinsurance group supervision and the exchange of information between insurance supervisors the covered agreement if it comes into force would eliminate reinsurance collateral requirements in the us for a reinsurer domiciled in the eu and likewise in the eu for a reinsurer domiciled in the us if such reinsurer meets certain specified minimum criteria the covered agreement would also prevent us states and eu countries from maintaining or adopting any new requirements with substantially the same impact on a reinsurer as the collateral requirements eliminated under the covered agreement local presence requirements for reinsurers from the us or eu operating in the other partys territory would also be eliminated with respect to group supervision a us or eu insurance or reinsurance group would be subject to worldwide group supervision including governance solvency and capital and reporting in the jurisdiction where the ultimateworldwide parent has its head office or is domiciled however if the insurance group also operates in the territory of the other party to the covered agreement then a regulator in a jurisdiction in the other party could exercise authority over an insurance or reinsurance group but only at the level of the parent holding company located in its jurisdiction and not on a worldwide level subject to certain exceptions with respect to the exchange of information between insurance supervisors the covered agreement includes a provision that encourages insurance supervisory authorities in the us and the eu to cooperate in exchanging supervisory information 

under the doddfrank act ninety days following the date it is submitted to the us congress the covered agreement may enter into force on the eu side the european council and the european parliament must each adopt decisions approving the covered agreement before it can come into force the covered agreement sets out on a provisionbyprovision basis time frames for implementation however there is no guarantee that the covered agreement will come into force or that cedants will be willing to accept reduced collateral requirements 

the fio is required to report to congress annually on the insurance industry and any preemption actions regarding any covered agreement 

on december 12 2013 the fio delivered a report to congress on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the us the report recommended that in the short term the us system of insurance regulation can be modernized through statebased improvements combined with certain federal actions the report identified areas for direct federal involvement in international standard setting the fio participation in supervisory colleges which monitor the regulation of large national and internationally active insurance groups and federal pursuit of international covered agreements to afford nationally uniform treatment of reinsurance collateral requirements the report also made several recommendations for state reform of insurance regulation including changes to the state regulation of insurance company solvency group supervision and corporate governance the fio report stated that the system of us insurance regulation can be modernized and improved in the shortterm while warning that if the states do not act in the near term to effectively regulate matters on a consistent and cooperative basis in the fio’s view there will be a greater role for federal regulation of insurance 

the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure ie a systemically important financial institution an insurer so designated by fsoc will be subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards as of december 31 2016 two insurance groups are subject to this supervision and heightened standards based upon our current business model and balance sheet we do not believe that we will be designated by the fsoc as such an institution although the potential impacts of the doddfrank act on the u s insurance industry are not clear our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically important nonbank financial companies 

international regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by the prudential regulation authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca the pras primary objectives with regard to insurers are to promote the safety and soundness of insurers and to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for current and future policyholders while the fca has three operational objectives i to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers ii to protect and enhance the integrity of the united kingdom financial system and iii to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the financial services markets the pra and fca employ a variety of regulatory tools to achieve their objectives including periodic auditing and reporting requirements risk assessment reviews minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements dividend restrictions in certain cases approval requirements governing the appointment of key officers approval requirements governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements our lloyds managing agency is also regulated by the pra fca and lloyds and the lloyds syndicate business is subject to lloyds supervision through lloyds we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of lloyds international licenses in each such country we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country additionally pra and fca regulations also impact us as “controller” a prafca defined term of our ukregulated subsidiaries whereby we are required to notify the prafca about significant events relating to the ukregulated subsidiaries controllers ie persons or entities which have certain levels of direct or indirect voting power or economic interests in the regulated entities as well as changes of control and to submit an annual report regarding their controllers as well the prafcas senior insurance managers regime provides a regulatory framework for standards of fitness and propriety conduct and accountability to be applied to individuals in positions of responsibility at insurers in addition certain employees are individually registered at lloyds 

 in the european union a new insurance regulatory regime governing among other things capital adequacy and risk management called “solvency ii” became effective on january 1 2016 lloyd’s applies a capital adequacy test to all lloyd’s syndicates including our syndicate that is based on solvency ii principles solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency under solvency ii it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii currently the us system of insurance regulation relating to group supervision is not deemed equivalent to solvency ii by european union authorities however we have received a waiver from the pra subject to conditions with respect to the pras supervision of our group which waives the requirement on us to maintain a group solvency capital requirement as calculated under solvency ii rules the covered agreement also prohibits any eu supervisor from exercising groupwide supervision at any level above the highest company organized in the country of that supervisor 

our international underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in certain countries in mexico scandinavia continental europe south america australia southeast asia and canada generally our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements while each country imposes licensing solvency auditing and financial reporting requirements the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially key areas where country regulations may differ include i the type of financial reports to be filed ii a requirement to use local intermediaries iii the amount of reinsurance 

permissible iv the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates and v the type and frequency of regulatory examinations 

competition   

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with many insurance companies of various sizes as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as selfinsured retentions or captive programs transacting business in the united states and internationally we compete directly with a large number of these companies competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit although insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business since 2011 the rate of increase has declined in more recent years that decline accelerated in 2016 loss costs have also increased over that period of time with the low level of interest rates available current price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its longterm return objectives 

competition for the insurance business within the united states comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers our specialty operating units compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers other regional units compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers additionally direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional units by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company our insurance operations compete internationally with native insurance operations both large and small which in some cases are related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

competition for the reinsurance business which is especially strong comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance partner re and others 

 in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively 

additionally competition from insurers and reinsurers based in taxadvantaged jurisdictions continues to increase including from domesticbased subsidiaries of foreignbased entities in the excess and surplus lines businesses 

employees   

as of january 31 2017 we employed 7683 individuals of this number our subsidiaries employed 7536 persons and the remaining persons were employed at the parent company 

other information about the companys business 

we maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 

seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 

we have no customer that accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues 

compliance by w r berkley and its subsidiaries with federal state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below occur our businesses results of operations andor financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in addition to those described below our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

risks relating to our industry   

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties in demand and pricing causing cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business in recent years we have faced increased competition in our business as a result of new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share resulting in decreased premium rates and less favorable contract terms and conditions for certain lines of business the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return have impacted rate adequacy with interest rates remaining at historic lows these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which have reduced premium rates in certain areas and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume   

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided including ease of doing business over the internet speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written in recent years the insurance industry has undergone increasing consolidation which may further increase competition 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial andor marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from bermuda or other tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive and pricing advantages 

over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business as increased supply has led to reduced prices and at times less favorable terms and conditions our specialty operating units have also encountered competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share although insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business since 2011 the rate of increase has declined in more recent years that decline accelerated in 2016 loss costs have also increased over that period of time with the low level of interest rates available current price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for us to achieve our longterm return objectives we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and as a result pressure on pricing and policy terms and conditions 

in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves   

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 112 billion as of december 31 2016 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on managements assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions both inflation overall and medical cost inflation which has historically been greater than inflation overall can have an adverse impact 

reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain   

as industry practices and economic legal judicial social and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include but are not limited to 

•   judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability 

•   plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers including us in purported class action litigation relating to claims 

                handling and other practices 

•   medical developments that link health issues to particular causes resulting in liability claims 

•   claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies including cyber security related risks 

  and 

•   claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions 

in some instances these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies as a result the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued 

in addition the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue to remove limitations on recovery to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business 

the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes   

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results for 

example catastrophe losses net of reinsurance recoveries were 105 million in 2016 58 million in 2015 87 million in 2014 65 million in 2013 and 80 million in 2012 similarly manmade catastrophes can also have a material impact on our financial results 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes tsunamis hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist and other manmade activities including drilling mining and other industrial accidents or terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition or profitability 

there is an emerging scientific view that the earth is getting warmer climate change to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns may affect the frequency and severity of storms and other weather events as well as the affordability availability and underwriting results of various types of commercial insurance and if frequency and severity patterns increase could negatively affect our financial results 

conditions in the financial markets and the global economy have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

the significant volatility and uncertainty experienced in financial markets around the world during the past several years and the effect of the economic downturn have continued although the us and various foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets the ultimate effectiveness of such actions remains unclear therefore volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and the resulting negative economic impact may continue for some time for example financial markets have been affected by concerns over us fiscal policy as well as the related concern regarding the need to reduce the federal deficit these issues together with the slowing of the global economy generally could send the us into a new recession further exacerbate concerns over sovereign debt of other countries and disrupt economic activity in the us and elsewhere similarly concerns about the solvency of certain european union member states and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by them has created market volatility that continues to affect the performance of various asset classes and likely will continue until there is an ultimate resolution of these sovereign debt related concerns 

while we monitor conditions in the financial markets we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our results of operations and financial condition depending on conditions in the financial markets we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in future periods and financial market volatility and uncertainty and an economic downturn could have a significant negative impact on third parties that we do business with including insureds and reinsurers 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts   

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “tripra” for up to 84 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2016 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2017 is approximately 915 million tripra is currently in effect through december 31 2020 in addition the coverage provided under tripra does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business   

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered in the united states by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 



 state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters our insurance business internationally is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations outside the united states 

federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to the current conditions in the financial markets and the recent economic downturn may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 

the doddfrank act effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant nonbank financial companies including insurance companies be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve the doddfrank act also established a federal insurance office “fio” which is authorized to study monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure the potential impact of the doddfrank act on the us insurance business is not clear our business could be affected by changes whether as a result of the doddfrank act or otherwise to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

three nonbank financial companies including two insurance groups are subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards as systematically significant financial institutions 

the new us administration and the majority party have expressed the desire to dismantle or roll back the doddfrank act which may present risks to our business for example in 2016 the us house of representatives passed the financial choice act of 2016 which proposed to roll back provisions of the doddfrank act affecting insurance while the financial choice act was not passed by the senate it is likely that the act or another doddfrank “roll back” bill affecting the insurance business will be introduced we are not able to predict whether any such proposal to roll back the doddfrank act would have a material effect on our business operations and cannot identify the risks if any that may be posed to our businesses as a result of changes to or legislative replacements for the doddfrank act 

although state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in the united states in addition to the changes brought about by the doddfrank act congress has considered various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarranferguson act and tax law changes we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution in addition the results of the recent us presidential and congressional elections may increase the chance of other federal legislative and regulatory changes that could affect us in ways we cannot predict 

with respect to international measures solvency ii the eu directive concerning the capital adequacy risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers may affect our insurance businesses implementation of solvency ii in eu member states occurred on january 1 2016 and may require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance in addition despite the waiver of the solvency ii group capital requirements we received solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers additionally our capital requirements and compliance requirements may be adversely affected if the eu commission finds that the insurance regulatory regimes of the jurisdictions outside the eu in which we have insurance or reinsurance companies domiciled are not equivalent to the requirements of solvency ii 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may further restrict the conduct of our business 

risks relating to our business 

  our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america canada mexico scandinavia the asiapacific region africa and australia expose us to increased investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our investments in nonusdenominated assets are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

the vote by the united kingdom to leave the european union eu could adversely affect our business 

the 2016 uk referendum on its membership in the eu resulted in a majority of uk voters voting in favor of the uk exiting the eu “brexit” as a result of this vote negotiations are commencing to determine the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the eu and its future relationship with the eu as a result we face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences related to the vote and brexit including with respect to volatility in financial markets exchange rates and interest rates these uncertainties could increase the volatility of or reduce our investment results in particular periods or over time brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and differing laws and regulations between the uk and the eu any of these potential effects and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our executive chairman our president and ceo senior executive officers presidents of our operating units experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses   

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2016 the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 1744 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

we are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders independent agents and brokers   

in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business including credit risk relating to policyholders independent agents and brokers for example our policyholders independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds 

as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn while we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms our efforts may not be successful for example to reduce such credit risk we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us in cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged andor the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit 

we are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poors or moodys our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a ratings downgrade could also adversely limit our access to capital markets which may increase the cost of debt a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

if conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable which may result from disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so on terms acceptable to us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience difficulties with our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems our ability to conduct our business could be negatively or severely impacted   

our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe terrorist attack or industrial accident or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if our business continuity plans or system security does not sufficiently address such a business interruption system failure or service denial our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed 

failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability  

our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks computer viruses hackers employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches in addition we routinely transmit and receive personal confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security while we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these thirdparty vendors and others with whom we do business we may be unable to put in place such secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and in addition these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive information being transferred our failure to protect sensitive personal and our proprietary information whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors could result in significant monetary and reputational damages these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs as a result our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective   

our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting claim processing and investment activities many of which are highly complex these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies as well as legal and regulatory standards including those related to privacy anticorruption antibribery and global finance and insurance matters our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance that the control systems objectives will be met if our controls are not effective it could lead to financial loss unanticipated risk exposure including underwriting credit and investment risk or damage to our reputation 

          risks relating to our investments   

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations   

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2016 our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 132 billion or 756 of our total investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 39 state and municipal securities 348 corporate securities 308 assetbacked securities 145 mortgagebacked securities 91 and foreign government 69 

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise if significant inflation or an increase in interest rates were to occur the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would be negatively impacted conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations additionally given the historically low interest rate environment we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals 

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession during periods of market disruption it may be difficult to value certain of our securities particularly if trading becomes less frequent andor market data becomes less observable there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment in such cases more securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment 

  although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue the economic downturn has resulted in many states and municipalities operating under deficits or projected deficits the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuers ability to perform its obligations thereunder additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the significant volatility experienced in the financial markets economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we have invested a portion of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets which are subject to significant volatility and may decline in value   

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets at december 31 2016 our investment in these assets was approximately 35 billion or 198 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents 

merger and arbitrage trading securities were 300 million or 17 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2016 merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

real estate related investments including directly owned investment funds and loans receivable were 19 billion or 111 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2016 we also invest in aviation and rail equipment funds hedged equity and energy and other investment funds the values of these investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and the related asset valuations in particular in addition our investments in real estate related assets and other alternative investments are less liquid than our other investments 

these investments are subject to significant volatility as a result of the conditions in the financial and commodity markets and the global economy 

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts   

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries during 2017 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 580 million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations pay dividends or repurchase shares 

laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable and may restrict a stockholders ability to purchase our common stock 

generally united states insurance holding   company laws require that before a person can acquire control of an insurance company prior written approval   must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is   domiciled pursuant to applicable laws and regulations “control” over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person   directly or indirectly owns controls holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 or more of   the voting securities of that insurer indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock thus   the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled are likely to   apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common   stock some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to   make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates on the one hand and the target   insurer and its affiliates on the other hand have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state additionally many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements 

while these provisions may not require acquisition approval they can lead to the imposition of conditions on an   acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation   these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control   of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might   consider to be desirable 

certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 

these provisions include 

 these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

w r berkley corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the united states and operates worldwide in two business segments of the property and casualty business insurance and reinsurance our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches it also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics while providing our business units with certain operating autonomy our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital investment reinsurance and enterprise risk management and actuarial financial and corporate legal staff support our primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments 

an important part of our strategy is to form new operating units to capitalize on various business opportunities over the years the company has formed numerous new operating units that are focused on important parts of the economy in the us including healthcare cyber security energy and agriculture and on growing international markets including scandinavia australia the asiapacific region south america and mexico 

the profitability of the company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time an insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural and other disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses general insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity ie the level of statutory capital and surplus employed in the industry and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital 

although insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business since 2011 the rate of increase has declined in more recent years that decline accelerated in 2016 loss costs have also increased over that period of time with the low level of interest rates available current price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its longterm return objectives part of the companys strategy is to selectively reduce its business in areas where it believes returns are not adequate price changes are reflected in the company’s results over time as premiums are earned 

the company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income and investment gains the company’s invested assets are invested principally in fixed maturity securities the return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities returns available on fixed maturity investments are at historically low levels the companys investment income has been negatively impacted by the low fixed maturity investment returns and will be further impacted if investment returns remain at this level 

the company also invests in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds including energy related funds private equity loans and real estate related assets the companys investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced and the company expects to continue to experience greater fluctuations in investment income 

critical accounting estimates 

the following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses assumed premiums and otherthantemporary impairments of investments management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments 

reserves for losses and loss expenses    to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among other things historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent a certain calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to uncertainty these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations the company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each operating unit these methods include paid loss development incurred loss development paid and incurred bornhuetterferguson methods and frequency and severity methods in circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others that method is used to set the point estimate for example the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data for new lines of business where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods the actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered industry loss experience is used to supplement the company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the company’s own data is limited the actuarial data is analyzed by line of business coverage and accident or policy year as appropriate for each operating unit 

the establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses these qualitative considerations include among others the impact of reunderwriting initiatives changes in the mix of business changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits the expansion of coverage exclusions whether or not defense costs are within policy limits and changes in deductibles and attachment points 

the key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is priced and written before any actual claims experience has emerged this expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each operating unit expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the longtail lines such as excess casualty and claims with a high medical component such as workers’ compensation reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses and are derived from the company’s own experience and industry data the paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred however different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates 

loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves including expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits retentions rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 

another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses less ibnr is required for lines with short reporting lags as a result loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates for lines with short reporting lags which include commercial automobile primary workers’ compensation other liability claimsmade and property business the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date for lines of business with long reporting lags which include other liability occurrence products liability excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider historically the company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags 

the key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the latest reported loss data current trends and other factors observed if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate the following table reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity relative to our assumptions on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2016 



our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 96 billion as of december 31 2016 relate to multiple accident years therefore the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above the impact of such changes would likely be manifested gradually over the course of many years as the magnitude of the changes became evident 

approximately 14 billion or 14 of the company’s net loss reserves as of december 31 2016 relate to the reinsurance segment there is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of assumed loss reserves because those estimates are based in part upon information received from ceding companies if information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct the company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate furthermore due to delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is extended management considers the impact of delayed reporting in its selection of assumed loss development factors 

information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business this information which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies the company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the company the information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks 

following is a summary of the company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of december 31 2016  and 2015 

  

following is a summary of the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses by major line of business as of december 31 2016  and 2015 

  

 

1 reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business are net of an aggregate net discount of 640 million and 699 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

  

2 shorttail lines include commercial multiperil nonliability inland marine accident and health fidelity and surety boiler and machinery and other lines 

  

the company evaluates reserves for losses and loss expenses on a quarterly basis changes in estimates of prior year losses are reported when such changes are made the changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends 

certain of the companys insurance and reinsurance contracts are retrospectively rated whereby the company collects more or less premiums based on the level of loss activity for those contracts changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years may be fully or partially offset by additional or return premiums 

net prior year development ie the sum of prior year reserve changes and prior year earned premiums changes for each of the last three years ended december 31 are as follows 

  

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 59 million in 2016 

insurance    reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 53 million in 2016 the favorable development was primarily related to workers compensation business and was partially offset by unfavorable development for medical professional liability business 

for workers compensation the favorable development was related to both primary and excess business and to many accident years including those prior to 2007 during 2016 reported workers compensation losses continued to be below our expectations at most of our operating units loss frequency and severity trends continued to be better than the assumptions underlying our previous reserve estimates loss severity trends also benefited from our continued investment in medical case management services and from our preferred provider networks the long term trend of declining workers compensation frequency can be attributed to improved workplace safety 

for medical professional liability business unfavorable development was primarily related to a class of business that has been discontinued the adverse development for that business stemmed mainly from accident years 2010 through 2015 

reinsurance    reserves for the reinsurance segment developed favorably by 6 million in 2016 the favorable development was primarily related to direct facultative reinsurance business and to accident years 2008 through 2014 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 63 million in 2015    

insurance   reserves for the insurance segment developed favorably by 52 million in 2015 the favorable development was primarily related to workers compensation other liability business and commercial property and was partially offset by unfavorable development for commercial automobile liability business and professional indemnity business 

for workers compensation the favorable development was related to both primary and excess business and to many accident years including those prior to 2006 in 2015 reported workers compensation losses were below our expectations for many of our operating units in addition overall loss frequency and severity trends emerged better than the assumptions underlying our previous reserve estimates the long term trend of declining workers compensation claim frequency continued in 2015 the improvement is attributable to better workplace safety and to benign medical severity trends as we continue to invest in medical case management services and higher usage of preferred provider networks 

for other liability business favorable development was concentrated in accident years 2007 through 2013 the favorable development was primarily related to our excess and surplus lines casualty business that has benefited from a persistent improvement in claim frequency trends over the past several years 

for commercial property business favorable development was attributable to accident years 2012 through 2014 and was driven by favorable frequency and severity trends on property business written in lloyds 

for commercial automobile business adverse development was primarily related to large losses for longhaul trucking business and to accident years 2011 through 2014 the higher loss cost trends for the commercial automobile industry are attributable in part to the increase in miles driven as the economy improved and fuel prices declined over the past several years 

for professional indemnity business in the uk adverse development was primarily for accident years 2006 through 2013 

reinsurance   reserves for the reinsurance segment developed favorably by 11 million in 2015 the favorable development was primarily related to direct facultative reinsurance business and to accident years 2005 through 2013 loss reserves developed favorably for umbrella business and for other liability coverage for contractors

fixed maturity securities  – for securities that we intend to sell or more likely than not would be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be otti the amount of otti is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value at the balance sheet date for securities that we do not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an otti if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security ie the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 

the portion of the decline in value considered to be a credit loss ie the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security is recognized in earnings the portion of the decline in value not considered to be a credit loss ie the difference in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value of the security is recognized in other comprehensive income

fair value measurements    the company’s fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale and its trading account securities are carried at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available the fair value of the vast majority of the company’s portfolio is based on observable data other than quoted prices and accordingly is classified as level 2 

in classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy the company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable the company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information the company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers the uninterrupted availability of such inputs the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time if the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable the security is categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers and reference data quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions for publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable the company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data for securities traded only in private negotiations the company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer financial data projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information

the company’s philosophy related to holding or selling fixed maturity securities is based on its objective of maximizing total return the key factors that management considers in its investment decisions as to whether to hold or sell fixed maturity securities are its view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as its expectations regarding interest rates credit spreads and currency values in a period in which management expects interest rates to rise the company may sell longer duration securities in order to mitigate the impact of an interest rate rise on the fair value of the portfolio similarly in a period in which management expects credit spreads to widen the company may sell lower quality securities and in a period in which management expects certain foreign currencies to decline in value the company may sell securities denominated in those foreign currencies the sale of fixed maturity securities in order to achieve the objective of maximizing total return may result in realized gains however there is no reason to expect these gains to continue in future periods

federal and foreign income taxes 

the company files a consolidated income tax return in the us and foreign tax returns in each of the countries in which it has overseas operations at december 31 2016  the company had a gross deferred tax asset net of valuation allowance of 472 million which primarily relates to loss and loss expense reserves and unearned premium reserves and a gross deferred tax liability of 606 million which primarily relates to deferred policy acquisition costs and unrealized investment gains the realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the companys ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods based on historical results and the prospects for future operations management anticipates that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient for the realization of this asset 

the company has not provided us deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of approximately 55 million of its nonus subsidiaries since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the nonus subsidiaries however in the future if such earnings were distributed to the company taxes of approximately 61 million assuming all tax credits are realized would be payable on such undistributed earnings and would be reflected in the tax provision for the year in which these earnings are no longer intended to be permanently reinvested in the foreign subsidiary 

reinsurance 

the company follows customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its exposures in exchange for paying reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies it writes reinsurance is purchased by the company principally to reduce its net liability on individual risks and to protect it against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage the company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and attempts to place its coverages only with substantial and financially sound carriers reinsurance coverage and retentions vary depending on the line of business location of the risk and nature of loss the company’s reinsurance purchases include the following 

 

the company places most of its significant casualty treaties on a “risk attaching” basis under risk attaching treaties all claims from policies incepting during the period of the reinsurance contract are covered even if they occur after the expiration date of the reinsurance contract if the company is unable to renew or replace its existing reinsurance coverage protection for unexpired policies would remain in place until their expiration in such case the company could revise its underwriting strategy for new business to reflect the absence of reinsurance protection property catastrophe and workers’ compensation catastrophe reinsurance is generally placed on a “losses occurring basis” whereby only claims occurring during the period are covered if the company is unable to renew or replace this reinsurance coverage unexpired policies would not be protected though we frequently have the option to purchase runoff coverage in our treaties 

following is a summary of earned premiums and loss and loss expenses ceded to reinsurers for each of the three years ended december 31 2016 



  

ceded earned premiums increased 46 in 2016 to 1099 million inline with the increase in direct and assumed earned premiums of 42 the ceded losses and loss expenses ratio increased 16 points to 64 in 2016 from 48 in 2015

offbalance sheet arrangements   

an offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has 1 made guarantees 2 a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets 3 an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or 4 any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to the company or that engages in leasing hedging or research and development arrangements with the company the company has no arrangements of these types that management believes may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition liquidity or results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk  the fair value of the company’s investments is subject to risks of fluctuations in credit quality and interest rates the company uses various models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage interest rate risk the company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate relationship between the effective duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities ie policy claims and debt obligations the effective duration for the fixed maturity portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was 31 years and 33 years at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

in addition the fair value of the company’s international investments is subject to currency risk the company attempts to manage its currency risk by matching its foreign currency assets and liabilities where considered appropriate 

the following table outlines the groups of fixed maturity securities and their effective duration at december 31 2016  



duration is a common measure of the price sensitivity of fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates the company determines the estimated change in fair value of the fixed maturity securities assuming parallel shifts in 

the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static the estimated fair value at specified levels at december 31 2016  would be as follows 



arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less the company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies including short sales 

additionally the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options selling call options or entering into swap contracts the companys merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks

loss and loss expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among others historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse 

before a definitive determination of liability is made although the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

the company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves the amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was 2308 million and 2187 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the aggregate net discount for those reserves after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 699 million and 746 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively at december 31 2015  discount rates by year ranged from 20 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 39 

substantially all of discounted workers’ compensation reserves 98 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2015  are excess workers’ compensation reserves in order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period once established no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized the expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the company’s loss payout experience 

the company also discounts reserves for certain other longduration workers’ compensation reserves representing approximately 2 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2015  including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease these reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 

to date known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the company’s operations because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to significant environmental or asbestos exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language 

the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims was 33 million at december 31 2015 and 36 million at december 31 2014 the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 51 million and 56 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims decreased approximately 2 million in 2015 and increased by approximately 4 million and 5 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 2 million in 2015 3 million in 2014 and 3 million in 2013 the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

           the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years 



 

 

also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information regarding the decrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2015  as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” in the company’s us regulatory filings is as follows 



 

1 for statutory purposes the company discounts its workers’ compensation reinsurance reserves at 27  as permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware in its gaap financial statements the company discounts excess workers’ compensation reserves at the riskfree rate and assumed workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate 

the following table presents the development of net reserves for 2005 through 2015 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 

the “cumulative redundancy” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 2005 is reserved for 2000 million as of december 31 2005 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2015 to 2300 million and was settled for 2300 million in 2015 the 300 million deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 2005 through 2015 



for certain retrospectively rated insurance polices and reinsurance agreements changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years are offset by additional or return premiums such premiums are not reflected in the above table

for certain retrospectively rated insurance polices and reinsurance agreements changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years are offset by additional or return premiums such premiums are not reflected in the above table 

reinsurance 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

  

us regulation   

our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 

overview  our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums loss expenses and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

holding company statutes  in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required 

to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations 

in addition effective 2015 we must annually submit to our lead state regulator an “enterprise risk management report” which identifies the activities and circumstances of any affiliated company that might have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our group or our us licensed insurers 

states have also adopted changes to the holding company act that authorize us insurance regulators to lead or participate in the groupwide supervision of certain international insurance groups national standard setters such as the international association of insurance supervisors are developing capital standards for international groups and us insurance regulators are currently working on us group capital standards for insurance groups it is unclear how the development of group capital measures will interact with existing capital requirements for insurance companies in the united states and with international capital standards it is possible that we may be required to hold additional capital as a result of these developments 

the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” adopted the risk management and own risk solvency assessment model act the “orsa model act” most states have adopted the orsa model act which requires an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an own risk and solvency assessment summary report “orsa” the orsa is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks under orsa we are required to 

 

 we cannot predict the impact if any that these holding company statutes and compliance with the orsa model act will have on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risk based capital requirements  the naic utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the naic rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any rbc action level as of december 31 2015 

insurance regulatory information system  the naic also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the insurance regulatory information system “iris” on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 

guaranty funds  our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and the liquidated companys available funds are insufficient to pay policyholders and claimants the amounts to which they are entitled the protection afforded under a states guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums in that state the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

additionally state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory propertyliability “shared market” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “fair” plans in addition some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 

dividends  we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

trade practices  state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers including provisions governing marketing and sales practices policyholder services claims management and complaint handling state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 

investment regulation investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind quality and concentration of investments in general these laws and regulations permit investments in federal state and municipal obligations corporate bonds preferred and common equity securities mortgage loans real estate and certain other investments subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications investments that do not comply with these limits and qualifications are deducted in our insurance subsidiaries calculation of their statutory capital and surplus 

terrorism risk insurance the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism pursuant to the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “tripra” the program has been extended for a six year period ending on december 31 2020 tripra provides a federal backstop to all us based property and casualty insurers for insurance related losses resulting from any act of terrorism on us soil or against certain us air carriers vessels or foreign missions tripra is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism tripras definition of certified acts includes domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tripra when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will currently pay 84 of an insurers covered losses in excess of the insurers applicable deductible this amount will decrease to 80 on a prorata basis over five years beginning in 2016 the insurers deductible is based on 20 percent of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2015 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2016 will be approximately 850 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 100 million industrywide this threshold will increase to 200 million on a prorata basis over five years beginning in 2016 tripra limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

excess and surplus lines  the regulation of our us subsidiaries excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business principally with respect to rates and policy forms strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 

federal regulation   although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways in july 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act created two new federal government bodies the federal insurance office the “fio” and the financial stability oversight council the “fsoc” which may impact the regulation of insurance although the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements it does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance the fio has authority to represent the united states in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the us insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk 

the fio has a particular role in connection with international insurance matters the fio represents the us at the international association of insurance supervisors “iais” in 2012 the fio participated in iais’s financial stability committee and joined iais’s executive committee the doddfrank act authorizes the secretary of the treasury and us trade representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance a “covered agreement” on november 20 2015 the fio and the us trade representative advised congress that they intend to initiate negotiations to enter into a covered agreement with the european union we are monitoring public reports on these negotiations which may affect our us and eu domiciled insurance and reinsurance 

business significantly the fio is authorized to preempt state measures that i are inconsistent with a covered agreement and ii disfavor nonus insurers subject to a covered agreement 

the fio is required to report to congress annually on the insurance industry and any preemption actions regarding any covered agreement 

on december 12 2013 the fio delivered a report to congress on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the us the report recommended that in the short term the us system of insurance regulation can be modernized through statebased improvements combined with certain federal actions the report identified areas for direct federal involvement in international standard setting the fio participation in supervisory colleges which monitor the regulation of large national and internationally active insurance groups and federal pursuit of international covered agreements to afford nationally uniform treatment of reinsurance collateral requirements the report also made several recommendations for state reform of insurance regulation including changes to the state regulation of insurance company solvency group supervision and corporate governance the fio report stated that the system of us insurance regulation can be modernized and improved in the shortterm while warning that if the states do not act in the near term to effectively regulate matters on a consistent and cooperative basis in the fio’s view there will be a greater role for federal regulation of insurance 

the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure ie a systemically important financial institution an insurer so designated by fsoc will be subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards as of december 31 2015 three insurance groups had been so designated based upon our current business model and balance sheet we do not believe that we will be designated by the fsoc as such an institution although the potential impacts of the doddfrank act on the u s insurance industry is not clear our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

international regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by the prudential regulation authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca the pras primary objectives with regard to insurers are to promote the safety and soundness of insurers and to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for current and future policyholders while the fca has three operational objectives i to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers ii to protect and enhance the integrity of the united kingdom financial system and iii to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the financial services markets the pra and fca employ a variety of regulatory tools to achieve their objectives including periodic auditing and reporting requirements risk assessment reviews minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements dividend restrictions in certain cases approval requirements governing the appointment of key officers approval requirements governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements our lloyds managing agency is also regulated by the pra fca and lloyds and the lloyds syndicate business is subject to lloyds supervision through lloyds we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of lloyds international licenses in each such country we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country additionally pra and fca regulations also impact us as “controller” a prafca defined term of our ukregulated subsidiaries whereby we are required to notify the prafca about significant events relating to the ukregulated subsidiaries controllers ie persons or entities which have certain levels of direct or indirect voting power or economic interests in the regulated entities as well as changes of control and to submit an annual report regarding their controllers as well the prafcas senior insurance managers regime provides a regulatory framework for standards of fitness and propriety conduct and accountability to be applied to individuals in positions of responsibility at insurers in addition certain employees are individually registered at lloyds 

 in the european union a new insurance regulatory regime governing among other things capital adequacy and risk management called “solvency ii” became effective on january 1 2016 lloyd’s applies a capital adequacy test to all lloyd’s syndicates including our syndicate that is based on solvency ii principles solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency under solvency ii it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii currently the us system of insurance regulation relating to group supervision is not deemed equivalent to solvency ii by european union authorities however we have received a oneyear waiver from the pra subject to conditions with respect to the pras supervision of our group which waives the requirement on us to maintain a group solvency capital requirement as calculated under solvency ii rules 

our international underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in certain countries in scandinavia continental europe south america australia southeast asia and canada generally our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements while each country imposes licensing solvency auditing and financial reporting requirements the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially key areas where country regulations may differ 

include i the type of financial reports to be filed ii a requirement to use local intermediaries iii the amount of reinsurance permissible iv the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates and v the type and frequency of regulatory examinations 

competition   

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with many insurance companies of various sizes as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as selfinsured retentions or captive programs transacting business in the united states and internationally we compete directly with a large number of these companies competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit although insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business since 2011 the rate of increase has declined in more recent years loss costs have also increased over that period of time with the low level of interest rates available current price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its longterm return objectives 

 competition for insurancedomestic business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers our specialty operating units compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers other regional units compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers additionally direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional units by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 

our insuranceinternational operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which in some cases are related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

competition for the reinsuranceglobal business which is especially strong comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance partner re and others 

in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively 

additionally competition from insurers and reinsurers based in taxadvantaged jurisdictions continues to increase including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreignbased entities in the excess and surplus lines businesses 

employees 

as of january 30 2016 we employed 7621 individuals of this number our subsidiaries employed 7481 persons and the remaining persons were employed at the parent company

we maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 

seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 

we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below occur our businesses results of operations andor financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in addition to those described below our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

risks relating to our industry   

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties in demand and pricing causing cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business in recent years we have faced increased competition in our business as a result of new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share resulting in decreased premium rates and less favorable contract terms and conditions for certain lines of business the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return have impacted rate adequacy with interest rates remaining at historic lows these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which have reduced premium rates in certain areas and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume   

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided including ease of doing business over the internet speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written in recent years the insurance industry has undergone increasing consolidation which may further increase competition 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsuranceglobal business have greater financial andor marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from bermuda or other tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive and pricing advantages 

over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business as increased supply has led to reduced prices and at times less favorable terms and conditions our specialty operating units have also encountered competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share although insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business since 2011 the rate of increase has declined in more recent years loss costs have also increased over that period of time with the low level of interest rates available current price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for us to achieve our longterm return objectives we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and as a result could experience renewed pressure on pricing and policy terms and conditions 

in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on 

terms and conditions acceptable to us if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves   

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 107 billion as of december 31 2015 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on managements assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions both inflation overall and medical cost inflation which has historically been greater than inflation overall can have an adverse impact 

reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain   

as industry practices and economic legal judicial social and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include but are not limited to 

•   judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability 

•   plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers including us in purported class action litigation relating to claimshandling and other practices 

•   medical developments that link health issues to particular causes resulting in liability claims 

•   claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies including cyber security related risks 

  and 

•   claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions 

in some instances these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies as a result the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued 

in addition the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue to remove limitations on recovery to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business 

the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes   

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results for example catastrophe losses were 58 million in 2015 87 million in 2014 65 million in 2013 80 million in 2012 and 153 million in 2011 similarly manmade catastrophes can also have a material impact on our financial results 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes tsunamis hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist and other manmade activities including drilling mining and other industrial accidents or terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition or profitability 

there is an emerging scientific view that the earth is getting warmer climate change to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns may affect the frequency and severity of storms and other weather events as well as the affordability availability and underwriting results of commercial property insurance and if frequency and severity patterns increase could negatively affect our financial results 

conditions in the financial markets and the global economy have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if such conditions continue   

the significant volatility and uncertainty experienced in financial markets around the world during the past several years and the effect of the economic downturn have continued although the us and various foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets the ultimate effectiveness of such actions remains unclear therefore volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and the resulting negative economic impact may continue for some time for example financial markets have been affected by concerns over us fiscal policy as well as the related concern regarding the need to reduce the federal deficit these issues together with the slowing of the global economy generally could send the us into a new recession further exacerbate concerns over sovereign debt of other countries and disrupt economic activity in the us and elsewhere similarly concerns about the solvency of certain european union member states and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by them has created market volatility that continues to affect the performance of various asset classes and likely will continue until there is an ultimate resolution of these sovereign debt related concerns 

while we monitor conditions in the financial markets we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our results of operations and financial condition depending on conditions in the financial markets we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in future periods and financial market volatility and uncertainty and an economic downturn could have a significant negative impact on third parties that we do business with including insureds and reinsurers 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts   

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “tripra” for up to 84 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2015 earned premiums our aggregate deductible under tripra during 2016 is approximately 850 million tripra is currently in effect through december 31 2020 in addition the coverage provided under tripra does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business   

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered in the united states by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

 22 

 state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters our insuranceinternational business is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations 

federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to the current conditions in the financial markets and the recent economic downturn may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 

in july 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant nonbank financial companies including insurance companies be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve the doddfrank act also established a federal insurance office “fio” which is authorized to study monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insureds material financial distress or failure the potential impact of the doddfrank act on the us insurance business is not clear our business could be affected by changes whether as a result of the doddfrank act or otherwise to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

fsoc has designated four nonbank financial companies including three insurance groups as systematically significant 

although state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in the united states in addition to the changes brought about by the doddfrank act congress has considered over the past years various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarranferguson act and tax law changes we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution 

with respect to international measures solvency ii the eu directive concerning the capital adequacy risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers may affect our insurance businesses implementation of solvency ii in eu member states occurred on january 1 2016 and may require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance in addition despite the oneyear waiver of the solvency ii group capital requirements we received solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers additionally our capital requirements and compliance requirements may be adversely affected if the eu commission finds that the insurance regulatory regimes of the jurisdictions outside the eu in which we have insurance or reinsurance companies domiciled are not equivalent to the requirements of solvency ii 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may further restrict the conduct of our business 

risks relating to our business 

  our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america canada scandinavia the asiapacific region africa and australia expose us to increased investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our investments in nonusdenominated securities are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our executive chairman our president and ceo senior executive officers presidents of our operating units experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses   

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2015 the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 1533 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

we are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders independent agents and brokers   

in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business including credit risk relating to policyholders independent agents and brokers for example our policyholders independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds 

as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn while we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms our efforts may not be successful for example to reduce such credit risk we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us in cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged andor the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit 

we are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poors or moodys our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a ratings downgrade could also adversely limit our access to capital markets which may increase the cost of debt a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would 

increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

if conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable which may result from disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so on terms acceptable to us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience difficulties with our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems our ability to conduct our business could be negatively or severely impacted   

our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe terrorist attack or industrial accident or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if our business continuity plans or system security does not sufficiently address such a business interruption system failure or service denial our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed 

failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability  

our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks computer viruses hackers employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches in addition we routinely transmit and receive personal confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security while we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these thirdparty vendors and others with whom we do business we may be unable to put in place such secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and in addition these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive information being transferred our failure to protect sensitive personal and our proprietary information whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors could result in significant monetary and reputational damages these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs as a result our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective   

our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting claim processing and investment activities many of which are highly complex these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies as well as legal and regulatory standards including those related to privacy anticorruption antibribery and global finance and insurance matters our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance that the control systems objectives will be met if our controls are not effective it could lead to financial loss unanticipated risk exposure including underwriting credit and investment risk or damage to our reputation 

risks relating to our investments   

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations   

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2015 our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 124 billion or 773 of our total investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 54 state and municipal securities 365 corporate securities 279 assetbacked securities 137 mortgagebacked securities 98 and foreign government 67 

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise if significant inflation or an increase in interest rates were to occur the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would be negatively impacted conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations additionally given the historically low interest rate environment we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals 

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession during periods of market disruption it may be difficult to value certain of our securities particularly if trading becomes less frequent andor market data becomes less observable there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment in such cases more securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment 

  although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue the economic downturn has resulted in many states and municipalities operating under deficits or projected deficits the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuers ability to perform its obligations thereunder additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the significant volatility experienced in the financial markets economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we have invested a portion of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets which are subject to significant volatility and may decline in value   

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets at december 31 2015 our investment in these assets was approximately 29 billion or 180 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents 

merger and arbitrage trading securities were 3767 million or 23 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2015 merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

real estate related investments including directly owned investment funds and loans receivable were 24 billion or 148 of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2015 we also invest in aviation and rail equipment funds hedged equity and energy and other investment funds the values of these investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and the related asset valuations in particular in addition our investments in real estate related assets and other alternative investments are less liquid than our other investments 

these investments are subject to significant volatility as a result of the conditions in the financial and commodity markets and the global economy 

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts   

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries during 2016 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 684 million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations pay dividends or repurchase shares 

laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable and may restrict a stockholders ability to purchase our common stock 

generally united states insurance holding   company laws require that before a person can acquire control of an insurance company prior written approval   must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is   domiciled pursuant to applicable laws and regulations “control” over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person   directly or indirectly owns controls holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 or more of   the voting securities of that insurer indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock thus   the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance operating units are domiciled are likely to   apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common   stock some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to   make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates on the one hand and the target   insurer and its affiliates on the other hand have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state additionally many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements 

while these provisions may not require acquisition approval they can lead to the imposition of conditions on an   acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation   these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control   of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might   consider to be desirable 

certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 

these provisions include 

 these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

w r berkley corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the united states and operates in three business segments insurancedomestic insuranceinternational and reinsuranceglobal our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches it also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics while providing our business units with certain operating autonomy our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital investment reinsurance and enterprise risk management and actuarial financial and corporate legal staff support our primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments 

an important part of our strategy is to form new operating units to capitalize on various business opportunities over the years the company has formed numerous new operating units that are focused on important parts of the economy in the us including healthcare energy and agriculture and on growing international markets including scandinavia australia the asiapacific region and south america 

the profitability of the company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time an insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural and other disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses general insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity ie the level of statutory capital and surplus employed in the industry and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital 

although insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business since 2011 the rate of increase has declined in more recent years loss costs have also increased over that period of time with the low level of interest rates available current price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its longterm return objectives part of the companys strategy is to selectively reduce its business in areas where it believes returns are not adequate price changes are reflected in the company’s results over time as premiums are earned 

the company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income and investment gains the company’s invested assets are invested principally in fixed maturity securities the return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities returns available on fixed maturity investments are at historically low levels the companys investment income has been negatively impacted by the low fixed maturity investment returns and will be further impacted if investment returns remain at this level 

the company invests in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds including energy related funds private equity loans and real estate related assets the companys investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced and the company expects to continue to experience greater fluctuations in investment income 

critical accounting estimates 

the following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses assumed premiums and otherthantemporary impairments of investments management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments 

reserves for losses and loss expenses    to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among other things historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent a certain calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to uncertainty these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations the company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each operating unit these methods include paid loss development incurred loss development paid and incurred bornhuetterferguson methods and frequency and severity methods in circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others that method is used to set the point estimate for example the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data for new lines of business where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods the actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered industry loss experience is used to supplement the company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the company’s own data is limited the actuarial data is analyzed by line of business coverage and accident or policy year as appropriate for each operating unit 

the establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses these qualitative considerations include among others the impact of reunderwriting initiatives changes in the mix of business changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits the expansion of coverage exclusions whether or not defense costs are within policy limits and changes in deductibles and attachment points 

the key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is priced and written before any actual claims experience has emerged this expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each operating unit expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the longtail lines such as excess casualty and claims with a high medical component such as workers’ compensation reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses and are derived from the company’s own experience and industry data the paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred however different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates 

loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves including expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits retentions rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 

another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses less ibnr is required for lines with short reporting lags as a result loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates for lines with short reporting lags which include commercial automobile primary workers’ compensation other liability claimsmade and property business the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date for lines of business with long reporting lags which include other liability occurrence products liability excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider historically the company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags 

the key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the latest reported loss data current trends and other factors observed if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate the following table reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity relative to our assumptions on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2015 



our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 92 billion as of december 31 2015 relate to multiple accident years therefore the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above the impact of such changes would likely be manifested gradually over the course of many years as the magnitude of the changes became evident 

approximately 14 billion or 15 of the company’s net loss reserves as of december 31 2015 relate to the reinsuranceglobal segment there is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of assumed loss reserves because those estimates are based in part upon information received from ceding companies if information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct the company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate furthermore due to delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is extended management considers the impact of delayed reporting in its selection of assumed loss development factors 

information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business this information which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies the company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the company the information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks 

following is a summary of the company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of december 31 2015 and 2014 

  

following is a summary of the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses by major line of business as of december 31 2015 and 2014 

  

 

1 reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business are net of an aggregate net discount of 699 million and 746 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

2 shorttail lines include commercial multiperil nonliability inland marine accident and health fidelity and surety boiler and machinery and other lines 

  

  

the company evaluates reserves for losses and loss expenses on a quarterly basis changes in estimates of prior year losses are reported when such changes are made the changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends 

certain of the companys insurance and reinsurance contracts are retrospectively rated whereby the company collects more or less premiums based on the level of loss activity for those contracts changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years may be fully or partially offset by additional or return premiums 

net prior year development ie the sum of prior year reserve changes and prior year earned premiums changes for each of the three years ended december 31 2015 are as follows 

  

  

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 63 million in 2015    

insurancedomestic    reserves for the insurancedomestic segment developed favorably by 47 million in 2015 the favorable development was primarily related to workers compensation and other liability business and was partially offset by unfavorable development for commercial automobile liability business 

for workers compensation the favorable development was related to both primary and excess business and to many accident years including those prior to 2006 in 2015 reported workers compensation losses were below our expectations for many of our operating units in addition overall loss frequency and severity trends emerged better than the assumptions underlying our previous reserve estimates the long term trend of declining workers compensation claim frequency continued in 2015 the improvement is attributable to better workplace safety and to benign medical severity trends as we continue to invest in medical case management services and higher usage of preferred provider networks 

for other liability business favorable development was concentrated in accident years 2007 through 2013 the favorable development was primarily related to our excess and surplus lines casualty business that has benefited from a persistent improvement in claim frequency trends over the past several years 

for commercial automobile business adverse development was primarily related to large losses for longhaul trucking business and to accident years 2011 through 2014 the higher loss cost trends for the commercial automobile industry are attributable in part to the increase in miles driven as the economy has improved and fuel prices have declined over the past several years 

reinsuranceglobal   reserves for the reinsuranceglobal segment developed favorably by 11 million in 2015 the favorable development was primarily related to direct facultative reinsurance business and to accident years 2005 through 2013 loss reserves developed favorably for umbrella business and for other liability coverage for contractors 

insuranceinternational   reserves for the insuranceinternational segment developed favorably by 5 million in 2015 the favorable development was related primarily to commercial property the favorable commercial property development was attributable to accident years 2012 through 2014 and was driven by favorable frequency and severity trends on property business written in lloyds the favorable property development was partially offset by unfavorable development for professional indemnity business in the uk primarily for accident years 2006 through 2013 

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 85 million in 2014    

for the insurancedomestic segment favorable development in 2014 of 92 million was driven primarily by other liability business for accident years 2006 through 2010 primarily related to our excess and surplus lines casualty business reported losses during these years continued to be below our initial expectations at the time the business was written largely as a result of persistent improvement in claim frequency trends ie number of reported claims per unit of exposure as these accident years have matured the weighting of actuarial methods has shifted from methods based on initial expected losses to 

methods based on actual reported losses we believe the favorable claim frequency trends we have seen during this time period are due to changes in the mix of business written and to the general slowdown in the economy commercial automobile reported unfavorable development primarily as a result of large losses for longhaul trucking business in 2012 and 2013 

for the reinsuranceglobal segment favorable reserve development in 2014 of 16 million was driven primarily by assumed professional liability excess of loss and umbrella treaty business as well as direct facultative business this was partially offset by adverse development on brokerage facultative business caused by completed operations losses associated with construction projects in accident years prior to 2009 

for the insuranceinternational segment adverse reserve development in 2014 of 23 million was driven primarily by unexpected large losses from accident years 20092012 in the professional indemnity line of business in the united kingdom 

favorable prior year reserve development net of additional and return premiums was 98 million in 2013 

favorable development in 2013 was primarily attributable to accident years 2006 through 2012 and included favorable development of 39 million for other liability business 32 million for reinsurance assumed liability business 22 million for workers’ compensation 18 million for commercial property and 24 million for other lines of business the favorable development in 2013 was largely driven by loss cost trends which were more favorable than originally anticipated in particular loss frequency trends have been more favorable than expected for excess  surplus lines casualty business workers compensation and excess of loss professional and other liability business 

the 2013 favorable development was partially offset by unfavorable development of 23 million for commercial automobile business and 14 million for products liability business commercial automobile development was driven by large losses for longhaul trucking business in 2011 and 2012 product liability development stemmed from completed operations losses associated with construction projects in accident years prior to 2009 

reserve discount  the company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves the amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was 2308 million and 2187 million at december 31 2015  and 2014 respectively the aggregate net discount for those reserves after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 699 million and 746 million at december 31 2015  and 2014 respectively at december 31 2015  discount rates by year ranged from 20 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 39 

substantially all of discounted workers’ compensation reserves 98 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2015  are excess workers’ compensation reserves in order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period once established no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized the expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the company’s loss payout experience 

the company also discounts reserves for certain other longduration workers’ compensation reserves representing approximately 2 of total discounted reserves at december 31 2015  including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease these reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 

assumed reinsurance premiums  the company estimates the amount of assumed reinsurance premiums that it will receive under treaty reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contracts these premium estimates are revised as the actual amount of assumed premiums is reported to the company by the ceding companies as estimates of assumed premiums are made or revised the related amount of earned premiums commissions and incurred losses associated with those premiums are recorded estimated assumed premiums receivable were approximately 62 million and 85 million at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively the assumed premium estimates are based upon terms set forth in reinsurance agreements information received from ceding companies during the underwriting and negotiation of agreements reports received from ceding companies and discussions and correspondence with reinsurance intermediaries the company also considers its own view of market conditions economic trends and experience with similar lines of business these premium estimates represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate amount of premiums to be received under its assumed reinsurance agreements 

otherthantemporary impairments otti of investments  the cost of securities is adjusted where appropriate to include a provision for decline in value which is considered to be otherthantemporary an otherthantemporary decline is considered to occur in investments where there has been a sustained reduction in fair value and where the company does not expect the fair value to recover prior to the time of sale or maturity since equity securities do not have a contractual cash flow 

or maturity the company considers whether the price of an equity security is expected to recover within a reasonable period of time 

the company classifies its fixed maturity securities and preferred stocks by credit rating primarily based on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies for purposes of classifying securities with different ratings the company uses the lower rating if two ratings were assigned and the middle rating if three ratings were assigned unless the company’s own analysis indicates that the lower rating is more appropriate securities that are not rated by a rating agency are evaluated and classified by the company on a casebycase basis 

fixed maturity securities  – for securities that we intend to sell or more likely than not would be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be otti the amount of otti is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value at the balance sheet date for securities that we do not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an otti if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security ie the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 

the portion of the decline in value considered to be a credit loss ie the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security is recognized in earnings the portion of the decline in value not considered to be a credit loss ie the difference in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value of the security is recognized in other comprehensive income 

impairment assessments for structured securities including mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities collateralized debt obligations and corporate debt are generally evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios that may involve subjective judgments and estimates by management modeling these securities involves various factors such as projected default rates the nature and realizable value of the collateral if any the ability of the issuer to make scheduled payments historical performance and other relevant economic and performance factors if an otti determination is made a discounted cash flow analysis is used to ascertain the amount of the credit impairment 

the following table provides a summary of fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position as of december 31 2015 



a summary of the company’s noninvestment grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2015 is presented in the table below 

  



  

the company has evaluated its fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and believes the unrealized loss is due primarily to temporary market and sectorrelated factors rather than to issuerspecific factors none of these securities are delinquent or in default under financial covenants based on its assessment of these issuers the company expects them to continue to meet their contractual payment obligations as they become due and does not consider any of these securities to be otti for the year ended december 31 2015  otti for fixed maturities recognized in earnings were 90 million all of 

which were considered due to credit factors there were no otti of fixed maturity securities for the year ended december 31 2014  

preferred stocks  – at december 31 2015  there was 1  preferred stock in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of 223 million  and a gross unrealized loss of 34 million  the preferred stock is rated investment grade management believes the unrealized loss is due primarily to market and sector related factors and does not consider it to be otti for the year ended december 31 2015  otti for preferred stocks were 134 million there were no otti for preferred stocks for the year ended december 31 2014 

common stocks  – at december 31 2015 there were two common stocks in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of 265 million and a gross unrealized loss of 192 million based on managements view of the underlying securities the company does not consider the common stocks to be otti for the year ended december 31 2015  otti for common stocks were 109 million there were no otti for common stocks for the year ended december 31 2014 

loans receivable  – the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable including current market conditions for each loan and the ability to collect principal and interest for loans where the company determines it is probable that the contractual terms will not be met an analysis is performed and a valuation reserve is established if necessary with a charge to earnings loans receivable are reported net of a valuation reserve of 2 million and 3 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable and assesses the ability of each borrower to pay principal and interest based upon loan structure underlying property values cash flow and related financial and operating performance of the property and market conditions loans receivable with a potential for default are further assessed using discounted cash flow analysis and comparable cost and sales methodologies if appropriate 

fair value measurements    the company’s fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale and its trading account securities are carried at fair value fair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date” the company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available the fair value of the vast majority of the company’s portfolio is based on observable data other than quoted prices and accordingly is classified as level 2 

in classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy the company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable the company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information the company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers the uninterrupted availability of such inputs the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time if the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable the security is categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers and reference data quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions for publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable the company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data for securities traded only in private negotiations the company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer financial data projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information 

the following is a summary of pricing sources for the companys fixed maturity securities available for sale as of december 31 2015 

  

independent pricing services   substantially all of the company’s fixed maturity securities available for sale were priced by independent pricing services generally one us pricing service plus additional pricing services with respect to a limited number of foreign securities held by the company the prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets eg broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities the determination of whether markets are active or inactive is based upon the volume and level of activity for a particular asset class the company reviews the prices provided by pricing services for reasonableness based upon current trading levels for similar securities if the prices appear unusual to the company they are reexamined and the value is either confirmed or revised in addition the company periodically performs independent price tests of a sample of securities to ensure proper valuation and to verify our understanding of how securities are priced as of december 31 2015 the company did not make any adjustments to the prices provided by the pricing services based upon the company’s review of the methodologies used by the independent pricing services these securities were classified as level 2 

syndicate manager  – the company has a 15 participation in a lloyd’s syndicate and the company’s share of the securities owned by the syndicate is priced by the syndicate’s manager the majority of the securities are liquid short duration fixed maturity securities the company reviews the syndicate manager’s pricing methodology and audited financial statements and holds discussions with the syndicate manager as necessary to confirm its understanding and agreement with security prices based upon the company’s review of the methodologies used by the syndicate manager these securities were classified as level 2 

observable data  – if independent pricing is not available the company prices the securities directly prices are based on observable market data where available including current trading levels for similar securities and nonbinding quotations from brokers the company generally requests two or more quotes if more than one quote is received the company sets a price within the range of quotes received based on its assessment of the credibility of the quote and its own evaluation of the security the company generally does not adjust quotes obtained from brokers since these securities were priced based on observable data they were classified as level 2 

cash flow model  – if the above methodologies are not available the company prices securities using a discounted cash flow model based upon assumptions as to prevailing credit spreads interest rates and interest rate volatility time to maturity and subordination levels discount rates are adjusted to reflect illiquidity where appropriate these securities were classified as level 3

the company reported net income of 504 million in 2015 compared to 649 million in 2014 the 22 decrease in net income was primarily due to decreases in aftertax net investment gains of 106 million and aftertax net investment income of 60 million partially offset by an increase in aftertax underwriting income of 14 million the number of weighted average diluted shares decreased as a result of the company’s repurchases of its common stock in 2015 and 2014 

premiums  gross premiums written were 7250 million in 2015 an increase of 3 from 7063 million in 2014 the growth was due to a combination of increased exposures and higher rates approximately 77 of policies expiring in 2015 were renewed compared with a 79 renewal retention rate for policies expiring in 2014 

average renewal premium rates adjusted for change in exposures increased 65 in 2013 34 in 2014 and 12 in 2015 however overall loss costs are also increasing and current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its longterm return objectives

fixed maturity securities  the company’s investment policy with respect to fixed maturity securities is generally to purchase instruments with the expectation of holding them to their maturity however management of the available for sale portfolio is considered necessary to maintain an approximate matching of assets and liabilities as well as to adjust the portfolio as a result of changes in financial market conditions and tax considerations 

the company’s philosophy related to holding or selling fixed maturity securities is based on its objective of maximizing total return the key factors that management considers in its investment decisions as to whether to hold or sell fixed maturity securities are its view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as its expectations regarding interest rates credit spreads and currency values in a period in which management expects interest rates to rise the company may sell longer duration securities in order to mitigate the impact of an interest rate rise on the fair value of the portfolio similarly in a period in which management expects credit spreads to widen the company may sell lower quality securities and in a period in which management expects certain foreign currencies to decline in value the company may sell securities denominated in those foreign currencies the sale of fixed maturity securities in order to achieve the objective of maximizing total return may result in realized gains however there is no reason to expect these gains to continue in future periods

liquidity and capital resources 

  cash flow  cash flow provided from operating activities increased to 881 million in 2015 from 735 million in 2014 the increase in cash flow was due primarily to an increase in cash flow from underwriting activities and a decrease in income taxes paid paid losses as a percent of earned premiums were 54 in both 2015 and 2014

the companys insurance subsidiaries principal sources of cash are premiums investment income service fees and proceeds from sales and maturities of portfolio investments the principal uses of cash are payments for claims taxes operating expenses and dividends the company expects its insurance subsidiaries to fund the payment of losses with cash received from premiums investment income and fees the company generally has targeted an effective duration for its investment portfolio that is within one year of the average duration of its liabilities so that portions of its investment portfolio mature throughout the claim cycle and are available for the payment of claims if necessary in the event operating cash flow and proceeds from maturities and prepayments of fixed income securities are not sufficient to fund claim payments and other cash requirements the remainder of the companys cash and investments is available to pay claims and other obligations as they become due the companys investment portfolio is highly liquid with approximately 80 invested in cash cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities as of december 31 2015 if the sale of fixed maturity securities were to become necessary a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the cost and sales price of securities sold would be recognized

reinsurance 

the company follows customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its exposures in exchange for paying reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies it writes reinsurance is purchased by the company principally to reduce its net liability on individual risks and to protect it against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage the company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and attempts to place its coverages only with substantial and financially sound carriers reinsurance coverage and retentions vary depending on the line of business location of the risk and nature of loss the company’s reinsurance purchases include the following 

 

the company places most of its significant casualty treaties on a “risk attaching” basis under risk attaching treaties all claims from policies incepting during the period of the reinsurance contract are covered even if they occur after the expiration date of the reinsurance contract if the company is unable to renew or replace its existing reinsurance coverage protection for unexpired policies would remain in place until their expiration in such case the company could revise its underwriting strategy for new business to reflect the absence of reinsurance protection property catastrophe and workers’ compensation catastrophe reinsurance is generally placed on a “losses occurring basis” whereby only claims occurring during the period are covered if the company is unable to renew or replace this reinsurance coverage unexpired policies would not be protected 

following is a summary of earned premiums and loss and loss expenses ceded to reinsurers for each of the three years ended december 31 2015

3 secured by letters of credit or other forms of collateral 

4 many states require licensed insurers that provide workers compensation insurance to participate in programs that provide workers compensation to employers that cannot procure coverage from an insurer on a voluntary basis insurers can fulfill this residual market obligation by participating in pools where results are shared by the participating companies the company acts as a servicing carrier for workers compensation pools in certain states as a servicing carrier the company writes residual market business directly and then cedes 100 of this business to the respective pool as a servicing carrier the company receives fee income for its services the company does not retain underwriting risk and credit risk is limited as ceded balances are jointly shared by all the pool members

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk  the fair value of the company’s investments is subject to risks of fluctuations in credit quality and interest rates the company uses various models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage interest rate risk the company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate relationship between the effective duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities ie policy claims and debt obligations the effective duration for the fixed maturity portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was 33 years and 32 years at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively

the following table outlines the groups of fixed maturity securities and their effective duration at december 31 2015  



duration is a common measure of the price sensitivity of fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates the company determines the estimated change in fair value of the fixed maturity securities assuming parallel shifts in 

the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static the estimated fair value at specified levels at december 31 2015  would be as follows 



arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less the company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies including short sales 

additionally the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options selling call options or entering into swap contracts the companys merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among others historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made although the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

we discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience for nonproportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve at december 31 2014 the discount rates by year ranged from 20  to 65  with a weighted average discount rate of 42  for proportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware of 2  the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 746 million  837 million  and 867 million  at december 31 2014  2013 and 2012 respectively 

to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations these claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which were subject to significant asbestos or environmental exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute pollution exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language 

our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 36 million  at both december 31 2014  and 2013 the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 56 million  and 59 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims increased by approximately 4 million  5 million  and 2 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 3 million 3 million and 2 million in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years 



 

 

also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information regarding the decrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2014  as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” in the company’s us regulatory filings is as follows 



 

1 for statutory purposes the company discounts its workers’ compensation reinsurance reserves at 2  as permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware in its gaap financial statements the company discounts excess workers’ compensation reserves at the riskfree rate and assumed workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate

the following table presents the development of net reserves for 2004 through 2014 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 

the “cumulative redundancy” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 2004 is reserved for 2000 million as of december 31 2004 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2014 to 2300 million and was settled for 2300 million in 2014 the 300 million deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 2004 through 2014 



for certain retrospectively rated insurance polices and reinsurance agreements changes in loss and loss adjustment expenses for prior years are offset by additional or return premiums such premiums are not reflected in the above table

for certain retrospectively rated insurance polices and reinsurance agreements changes in loss and loss adjustment expenses for prior years are offset by additional or return premiums such premiums are not reflected in the above table 

reinsurance 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 500 million in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

  

us regulation   

our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 

overview  our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums loss expenses and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

holding company statutes  in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with 

the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase 

the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” adopted amendments to the model holding company law in 2010 expanding upon the regulation of holding company systems the 2010 amendments the 2010 amendments include increased grouplevel reporting requirements submission of an annual enterprise risk report by a regulated insurance companys ultimate controlling person and increased information made accessible to regulators regarding an insurers noninsurer affiliates 

the 2010 amendments must be adopted by the individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective to date 39 states have adopted them and in order to maintain compliance with naic standards the remaining states must adopt them in whole or substantial part by january 2016 in 2014 additional amendments were adopted by the naic which would authorize us regulators to lead or participate in the groupwide supervision of certain international insurance groups 

additionally the naic recently adopted the risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act the “orsa model act” the orsa model act requires an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an own risk and solvency assessment summary report “orsa” the orsa is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks 

the orsa model act must be adopted by the individual state legislature and insurance regulators in order to be effective the orsa model act’s requirements generally became effective on january 1 2015 in the states that have adopted it 

we cannot predict the impact if any that these amendments and compliance with the orsa model act will have on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risk based capital requirements  the naic utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the naic rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any rbc action level as of december 31 2014 

insurance regulatory information system  the naic also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the insurance regulatory information system “iris” on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 

guaranty funds  our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a states guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

additionally state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory propertyliability “shared market” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “fair” plans in addition some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 

excess and surplus lines  the regulation of our us subsidiaries excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 

dividends  we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

trade practices  state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers including provisions governing marketing and sales practices policyholder services claims management and complaint handling state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 

investment regulation investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind quality and concentration of investments in general these laws and regulations permit investments in federal state and municipal obligations corporate bonds preferred and common equity securities mortgage loans real estate and certain other investments subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications 

the terrorism risk insurance act the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended “tria” established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism the program is effective through december 31 2020 tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism trias definition of certified acts includes domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will currently pay 85 of an insurers covered losses in excess of the insurers applicable deductible this amount will decrease to 80 on a prorata basis over five years beginning in 2016 the insurers deductible is based on 20 percent of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2014 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2015 will be approximately 786 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 100 million this threshold will increase to 200 million on a prorata basis over five years beginning in 2016 tria limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

federal regulation   although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways in july 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act created two new federal government bodies the federal insurance office the “fio” and the financial stability oversight council the “fsoc” which may impact the regulation of insurance although the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements it does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance the fio has authority to represent the united states in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the us insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk 

on december 12 2013 the fio delivered a report to congress on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the us the report recommended that in the short term the us system of insurance regulation can be modernized through statebased improvements combined with certain federal actions the report identified areas for direct federal involvement in international standard setting the fio participation in supervisory colleges which monitor the regulation of large national and internationally active insurance groups and federal pursuit of international covered agreements to afford nationally uniform treatment of reinsurance collateral requirements the report also made several recommendations for state reform of insurance regulation including changes to the state regulation of insurance company solvency group supervision and corporate governance the fio report stated that the system of us insurance regulation can be modernized and improved in the shortterm while warning that if the states do not act in the near term to effectively regulate matters on a consistent and cooperative basis in the fio’s view there will be a greater role for federal regulation of insurance 

the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure an insurer so designated by fsoc could be subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards as of december 31 2014 three insurance groups had been so designated based upon our current business model and balance sheet we do not believe that we will be designated by the fsoc as such an institution although the potential impacts of the doddfrank act on the u s insurance industry is not clear our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

international regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by the prudential regulation authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca the pras primary objective is to promote the safety and soundness of insurers for the protection of policyholders while the fca has three operational objectives i to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers ii to protect and enhance the integrity of the united kingdom financial system and iii to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers the pra and fca oversee compliance with established periodic auditing and reporting requirements risk assessment reviews minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements dividend restrictions restrictions governing the appointment of key officers restrictions governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements our lloyds syndicate and managing agency are also regulated by the pra fca and lloyds through lloyds we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of lloyds international licenses in each such country we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country additionally pra and fca regulations also impact us as “controller” a prafca defined term of our ukregulated subsidiaries whereby we are required to notify the prafca about significant events relating to their controllers ie persons or entities which have certain levels of influence over the regulated entities as well as changes of control and to submit an annual report regarding their controllers through the prafcas approved persons regime certain employees and directors are subject to regulation by the pra and fca as to their fitness in addition certain employees are individually registered at lloyds 

 in the european union a new insurance regulatory regime governing among other things capital adequacy and risk management called “solvency ii” is scheduled to take effect on january 1 2016 in anticipation of the implementation of solvency ii lloyd’s applies a capital adequacy test to all lloyd’s syndicates including our syndicate that is based on solvency ii principles solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency under solvency ii it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiarys capital position is dependent on the parent company and the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii while it is not certain how or if these actions will impact us we do not currently expect the capital management strategies for our us and international companies will be materially impacted 

our international underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in certain countries in scandinavia continental europe south america australia southeast asia and canada generally our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements while each country imposes licensing solvency auditing and financial reporting requirements the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially key areas where country regulations may differ include i the type of financial reports to be filed ii a requirement to use local intermediaries iii the amount of reinsurance permissible iv the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates and v the type and frequency of regulatory examinations 

competition   

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with many insurance companies of various sizes as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as selfinsured retentions or captive programs transacting business in the united states and internationally we compete directly with a large number of these companies competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit as a result of increased competition from 2005 to 2010 we generally experienced both downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and conditions although prices have generally increased since the beginning of 2011 current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its longterm return objectives 

competition for insurancedomestic business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers our specialty operating units compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers other regional units compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers additionally direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional units by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 

our insuranceinternational operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which in some cases are related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

competition for the reinsuranceglobal business which is especially strong comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance partner re and others 

in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact 

our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively 

additionally competition from insurers and reinsurers based in bermuda and other taxadvantaged jurisdictions continues to increase including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreignbased entities in the excess and surplus lines businesses 

employees 

as of january 30 2015 we employed 7521 individuals of this number our subsidiaries employed 7396 persons and the remaining persons were employed at the parent company

we maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 

seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 

we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below occur our businesses results of operations andor financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in addition to those described below our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

risks relating to our industry   

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties in demand and pricing causing cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business in recent years we have faced increased competition in our business as a result of new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share resulting in decreased premium rates and less favorable contract terms and conditions for certain lines of business the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return have impacted rate adequacy with interest rates remaining at historic lows these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which have reduced premium rates in certain areas and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume   

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies 

specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided including ease of doing business over the internet speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written in recent years the insurance industry has undergone increasing consolidation which may further increase competition 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsuranceglobal business have greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from bermuda or other tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive and pricing advantages 

over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business particularly in our insurancedomestic and reinsuranceglobal segments as increased supply has led to reduced prices and at times less favorable terms and conditions our specialty operating units have also encountered competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share from 2005 through 2010 the property casualty insurance market was very competitive and insurance rates decreased across most business lines although prices have generally increased since the beginning of 2011 current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its longterm return objectives we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and as a result could experience renewed pressure on pricing and policy terms and conditions 

in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves   

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 104 billion as of december 31 2014 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on managements assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions both inflation overall and medical cost inflation which has historically been greater than inflation overall can have an adverse impact 

reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain   

as industry practices and economic legal judicial social and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include but are not limited to 

•   judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability 

•   plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers including us in purported class action litigation relating to claimshandling and other practices 

•   medical developments that link health issues to particular causes resulting in liability claims 

•   claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies including cyber security related risks 

  and 

•   claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions 

in some instances these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies as a result the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued 

in addition the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue to remove limitations on recovery to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business 

the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes   

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results for example weatherrelated losses were 87 million in 2014 65 million in 2013 80 million in 2012 153 million in 2011 and 81 million in 2010 similarly manmade catastrophes can also have a material impact on our financial results 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes tsunamis hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist and other manmade activities including drilling mining and other industrial accidents or terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition or profitability 

there is an emerging scientific view that the earth is getting warmer climate change to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns may affect the frequency and severity of storms and other weather events as well as the affordability availability and underwriting results of commercial property insurance and if frequency and severity patterns increase could negatively affect our financial results 

conditions in the financial markets and the global economy have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if such conditions continue   

the significant volatility and uncertainty experienced in financial markets around the world during the past several years and the effect of the economic downturn have continued although the us and various foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets the ultimate effectiveness of such actions remains unclear therefore volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and the resulting negative economic impact may continue for some time for example financial markets have been affected by concerns over us fiscal policy as well as the related concern regarding the need to reduce the federal deficit these issues together with the slowing of the global economy generally could send the us into a new recession further exacerbate concerns over sovereign debt of other countries and disrupt economic activity in the 

us and elsewhere similarly concerns about the solvency of certain european union member states and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by them has created market volatility that continues to affect the performance of various asset classes and likely will continue until there is an ultimate resolution of these sovereign debt related concerns 

while we monitor conditions in the financial markets we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our results of operations and financial condition depending on conditions in the financial markets we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in future periods and financial market volatility and uncertainty and an economic downturn could have a significant negative impact on third parties that we do business with including insureds and reinsurers 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts   

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended “tria” for up to 85 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2014 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2015 is approximately 786 million tria is currently in effect through december 31 2020 in addition the coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business   

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered in the united states by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

 state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters our insuranceinternational business is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations 

federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to the current conditions in the financial markets and the recent economic downturn may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 

in july 2010 president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant nonbank financial companies including insurance companies be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve the doddfrank act also established a federal insurance office “fio” which is authorized to study monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insureds material financial distress or failure the potential impact of the doddfrank act on the us insurance business is not clear our business could be affected by changes whether as a result of the doddfrank act or otherwise to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

in 2013 fsoc designated three nonbank financial companies including two insurance groups as systematically significant and in 2014 fsoc designated a third insurance group as systematically significant 

although us state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in addition to the changes brought about by the doddfrank act congress has considered over the past years various proposals relating to the creation of 

an optional federal charter repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarran ferguson act and tax law changes we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution 

with respect to international measures solvency ii the eu directive concerning the capital adequacy risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers which was adopted by the european parliament in april 2009 may affect our insurance businesses implementation of solvency ii in eu member states is currently scheduled to occur on january 1 2016 and may require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance in addition solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers additionally our capital requirements and compliance requirements may be adversely affected if the eu commission finds that the insurance regulatory regimes of the jurisdictions outside the eu in which we have insurance or reinsurance companies domiciled are not equivalent to the requirements of solvency ii 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may further restrict the conduct of our business 

risks relating to our business 

  our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america canada scandinavia the asiapacific region and australia expose us to increased investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our investments in nonusdenominated securities are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our chairman and ceo president and coo senior executive officers presidents of our operating units experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses   

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2014 the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 1503 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

we are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders independent agents and brokers   

in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business including credit risk relating to policyholders independent agents and brokers for example our policyholders independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds 

as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn while we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms our 

efforts may not be successful for example to reduce such credit risk we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us in cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged andor the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit 

we are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poors or moodys our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a ratings downgrade could also adversely limit our access to capital markets which may increase the cost of debt a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

if conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable which may result from disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so on terms acceptable to us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience difficulties with our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems our ability to conduct our business could be negatively or severely impacted   

our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe terrorist attack or industrial accident or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if our business continuity plans or system security does not sufficiently address such a business interruption system failure or service denial our ability to write and process new and 

renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed 

failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability  

our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks computer viruses hackers employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches in addition we routinely transmit and receive personal confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security while we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these thirdparty vendors and others with whom we do business we may be unable to put in place such secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and in addition these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive information being transferred our failure to protect sensitive personal and our proprietary information whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors could result in significant monetary and reputational damages these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs as a result our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective   

our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting claim processing and investment activities many of which are highly complex these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies as well as legal and regulatory standards including those related to privacy anticorruption antibribery and global finance and insurance matters our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance that the control systems objectives will be met if our controls are not effective it could lead to financial loss unanticipated risk exposure including underwriting credit and investment risk or damage to our reputation 

risks relating to our investments   

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations   

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2014 our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 127 billion or 815 of our total investment portfolio as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 63 state and municipal securities 349 corporate securities 410 mortgagebacked securities 104 and foreign government 74 

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise if significant inflation were to occur the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would be negatively impacted conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations additionally given the historically low interest rate environment we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals 

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession during periods of market disruption it may be difficult to value certain of our securities particularly if trading becomes less frequent andor market data becomes less observable there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment in such cases more securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment 

  although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue the economic downturn has resulted in many states and municipalities operating under deficits or projected deficits the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuers ability to perform its obligations thereunder additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the significant volatility experienced in the financial markets economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we have invested an increasing portion of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets which are subject to significant volatility and may decline in value   

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets and have increased our investments in these asset classes as a result of the current historically low interest rate environment at december 31 2014 our investment in these assets was approximately 29 billion or 185 of our investment portfolio 

merger and arbitrage trading securities were 451 million or 29 of our investment portfolio at december 31 2014 merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

real estate related investments including directly owned investment funds and loans receivable were 15 billion or 100 of our investment portfolio at december 31 2014 we also invest in aviation and rail equipment funds hedged equity and energy and other investment funds the values of these investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and the related asset valuations in particular in addition our investments in real estate related assets and other alternative investments are less liquid than our other investments 

these investments are subject to significant volatility as a result of the conditions in the financial and commodity markets and the global economy 

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts   

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries during 2015 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 631 million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations pay dividends or repurchase shares 

laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable and may restrict a stockholders ability to purchase our common stock 

generally united states insurance holding   company laws require that before a person can acquire control of an insurance company prior written approval   must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is   domiciled pursuant to applicable laws and regulations “control” over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person   directly or indirectly owns controls holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 or more of   the voting securities of that insurer indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock thus   the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance operating units are domiciled are likely to   apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common   stock some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to   make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates on the one hand and the target   insurer and its affiliates on the other hand have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state additionally many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements 

while these provisions may not require acquisition approval they can lead to the imposition of conditions on an   acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation   these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control   of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might   consider to be desirable 

certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 

these provisions include 

 these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

w r berkley corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the united states and operates in three business segments insurancedomestic insuranceinternational and reinsuranceglobal our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches it also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics while providing our business units with certain operating autonomy our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital investment reinsurance and enterprise risk management and actuarial financial and corporate legal staff support the company’s primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments 

an important part of our strategy is to form new operating units to capitalize on various business opportunities since 2006 the company has formed 24 new operating units that are focused on important parts of the economy in the us including healthcare energy and agriculture and on growing international markets including scandinavia australia the asiapacific region and south america 

the profitability of the company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time an insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural and other disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses general insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity ie the level of statutory capital and surplus employed in the industry and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital 

from 2005 through 2010 the property casualty insurance market was very competitive and insurance rates decreased across most business lines although prices have generally increased since the beginning of 2011 the current market is highly competitive and price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its longterm return objectives part of the companys strategy is to selectively reduce its business in areas where it believes returns are not adequate price changes are reflected in the company’s results over time as premiums are earned 

the company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income and investment gains the company’s invested assets which are derived from its own capital and cash flow from its insurance business are invested principally in fixed maturity securities the return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities returns available on fixed maturity investments are at historically low levels the companys investment income has been negatively impacted by the low fixed maturity investment returns and will be further impacted if investment returns remain at this level 

the company has increasingly invested in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets the companys investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced and the company expects to continue to experience greater fluctuations in investment income 

critical accounting estimates 

the following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses assumed premiums and otherthantemporary impairments of investments management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments 

reserves for losses and loss expenses    to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among other things historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations the company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each operating unit these methods include paid loss development incurred loss development paid and incurred bornhuetterferguson methods and frequency and severity methods in circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others that method is used to set the point estimate for example the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data for new lines of business where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods the actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered industry loss experience is used to supplement the company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the company’s own data is limited the actuarial data is analyzed by line of business coverage and accident or policy year as appropriate for each operating unit 

the establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses these qualitative considerations include among others the impact of reunderwriting initiatives changes in the mix of business changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits the expansion of coverage exclusions whether or not defense costs are within policy limits and changes in deductibles and attachment points 

the key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is written before any actual claims experience has emerged this expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each operating unit expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the longtail lines such as excess casualty and claims with a high medical component such as workers’ compensation reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses and are derived from the company’s own experience and industry data the paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred however different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates 

loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves including expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits retentions rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 

another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses less ibnr is required for lines with short reporting lags as a result loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates for lines with short reporting lags which include commercial automobile primary workers’ compensation other liability claimsmade and property business the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date for lines of business with long reporting lags which include other liability occurrence products liability excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider historically the company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags 

the key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect historical changes current trends and other factors observed if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate the following table reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity relative to our assumptions on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2014 



our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 9 billion as of december 31 2014 relate to multiple accident years therefore the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above 

approximately 15 billion or 16 of the company’s net loss reserves as of december 31 2014 relate to the reinsuranceglobal segment there is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of assumed loss reserves because those estimates are based in part upon information received from ceding companies if information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct the company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate furthermore due to delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is extended management considers the impact of delayed reporting in its selection of assumed loss development factors 

information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business this information which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies the company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the company the information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks 

following is a summary of the company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of december 31 2014 and 2013 

  

following is a summary of the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses by major line of business as of december 31 2014 and 2013 

  

 

1 reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business are net of an aggregate net discount of 746 million and 837 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

the company evaluates reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on a quarterly basis changes in estimates of prior year losses are reported when such changes are made the changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends certain of the companys insurance and reinsurance contracts are retrospectively rated whereby the company collects more or less premiums based on the level of loss activity for those contracts changes in loss and loss adjustment expenses for prior years may be fully or partially offset by additional or return premiums net prior year development ie the sum of prior year reserve changes and prior year earned premiums changes for each of the three years ended december 31 2014 are as follows 

  

  

favorable prior year development net of additional and return premiums was 85 million in 2014 compared with 98 million in 2013 and 103 million in 2012 

for the insurancedomestic segment favorable development in 2014 of 92 million was driven primarily by other liability business for accident years 2006 through 2010 primarily related to our excess and surplus lines casualty business reported losses during these years continued to be below our initial expectations at the time the business was written largely as a result of persistent improvement in claim frequency trends ie number of reported claims per unit of exposure as these accident years have matured the weighting of actuarial methods has shifted from methods based on initial expected losses to methods based on actual reported losses we believe the favorable claim frequency trends we have seen during this time period are due to changes in the mix of business written and to the general slowdown in the economy commercial automobile reported unfavorable development primarily as a result of large losses for longhaul trucking business in 2012 and 2013 

for the reinsuranceglobal segment favorable reserve development in 2014 of 16 million was driven primarily by assumed professional liability excess of loss and umbrella treaty business as well as direct facultative business this was partially offset by adverse development on brokerage facultative business caused by completed operations losses associated with construction projects in accident years prior to 2009 

for the insuranceinternational segment adverse reserve development in 2014 of 23 million was driven primarily by unexpected large losses from accident years 20092012 in the professional indemnity line of business in the united kingdom 

favorable development in 2013 was primarily attributable to accident years 2006 through 2012 and included favorable development of 39 million for other liability business 32 million for reinsurance assumed liability business 22 million for workers’ compensation 18 million for commercial property and 24 million for other lines of business the favorable development in 2013 was largely driven by loss cost trends which were more favorable than originally anticipated in particular loss frequency trends have been more favorable than expected for excess  surplus lines casualty business workers compensation and excess of loss professional and other liability business 

the 2013 favorable development was partially offset by unfavorable development of 23 million for commercial automobile business and 14 million for products liability business commercial automobile development was driven by large losses for longhaul trucking business in 2011 and 2012 product liability development stemmed from completed operations losses associated with construction projects in accident years prior to 2009 

favorable reserve development in 2012 was primarily attributable to improved claim frequency ie number of reported claims per unit of exposure especially in the excess and surplus casualty business in addition standard commercial lines business and reinsurance business experienced better than expected reported losses the improvement was related primarily to accident years 2008 through 2010 

reserve discount  the company discounts its liabilities for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience for nonproportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve for proportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate of 20 as of december 31 2014 the aggregate blended discount rates ranged from 20 to 65 with a weighted average discount 

rate of 42 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 746 million and 837 million as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively 

assumed reinsurance premiums  the company estimates the amount of assumed reinsurance premiums that it will receive under treaty reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contracts these premium estimates are revised as the actual amount of assumed premiums is reported to the company by the ceding companies as estimates of assumed premiums are made or revised the related amount of earned premiums commissions and incurred losses associated with those premiums are recorded estimated assumed premiums receivable were approximately 85 million and 69 million at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively the assumed premium estimates are based upon terms set forth in reinsurance agreements information received from ceding companies during the underwriting and negotiation of agreements reports received from ceding companies and discussions and correspondence with reinsurance intermediaries the company also considers its own view of market conditions economic trends and experience with similar lines of business these premium estimates represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate amount of premiums to be received under its assumed reinsurance agreements 

otherthantemporary impairments otti of investments  the cost of securities is adjusted where appropriate to include a provision for decline in value which is considered to be otherthantemporary an otherthantemporary decline is considered to occur in investments where there has been a sustained reduction in fair value and where the company does not expect the fair value to recover prior to the time of sale or maturity since equity securities do not have a contractual cash flow or maturity the company considers whether the price of an equity security is expected to recover within a reasonable period of time 

the company classifies its fixed maturity securities and preferred stocks by credit rating primarily based on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies for purposes of classifying securities with different ratings the company uses the lower rating if two ratings were assigned and the middle rating if three ratings were assigned unless the company’s own analysis indicates that the lower rating is more appropriate securities that are not rated by a rating agency are evaluated and classified by the company on a casebycase basis 

fixed maturity securities  – for securities that we intend to sell or more likely than not would be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be otti the amount of otti is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value at the balance sheet date for securities that we do not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an otti if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security ie the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 

the portion of the decline in value considered to be a credit loss ie the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security is recognized in earnings the portion of the decline in value not considered to be a credit loss ie the difference in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value of the security is recognized in other comprehensive income 

impairment assessments for structured securities including mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities collateralized debt obligations and corporate debt are generally evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios that may involve subjective judgments and estimates by management modeling these securities involves various factors such as projected default rates the nature and realizable value of the collateral if any the ability of the issuer to make scheduled payments historical performance and other relevant economic and performance factors if an otti determination is made a discounted cash flow analysis is used to ascertain the amount of the credit impairment 

the following table provides a summary of fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position as of december 31 2014 



a summary of the company’s noninvestment grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2014 is presented in the table below 

  



  

the company has evaluated its fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and believes the unrealized loss is due primarily to temporary market and sectorrelated factors rather than to issuerspecific factors none of these securities are delinquent or in default under financial covenants based on its assessment of these issuers the company expects them to continue to meet their contractual payment obligations as they become due and does not consider any of these securities to be otti 

preferred stocks  – at december 31 2014  there were 6  preferred stocks in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of 498 million  and a gross unrealized loss of 42 million  four of these preferred stocks are rated noninvestment grade and none are delinquent management believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to market and sector related factors and does not consider these to be otti 

common stocks  – at december 31 2014 there were two common stocks in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of 159 million and a gross unrealized loss of 55 million based on managements view of the underlying securities the company does not consider the common stocks to be otti 

loans receivable  – the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable including current market conditions for each loan and the ability to collect principal and interest for loans where the company determines it is probable that the contractual terms will not be met an analysis is performed and a valuation reserve is established if necessary with a charge to earnings loans receivable are reported net of a valuation reserve of 3 million and 2 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable and assesses the ability of each borrower to pay principal and interest based upon loan structure underlying property values cash flow and related financial and operating performance of the property and market conditions loans receivable with a potential for default are further assessed using discounted cash flow analysis and comparable cost and sales methodologies if appropriate 

fair value measurements    the company’s fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale and its trading account securities are carried at fair value fair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date” the company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available the fair value of the vast majority of the company’s portfolio is based on observable data other than quoted prices and accordingly is classified as level 2 

in classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy the company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable the company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information the company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers the uninterrupted availability of such inputs the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time if the market for a security is determined to be inactive or 

if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable the security is categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers and reference data quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions for publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable the company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data for securities traded only in private negotiations the company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer financial data projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information 

the following is a summary of pricing sources for the companys fixed maturity securities available for sale as of december 31 2014

fixed maturity securities  the company’s investment policy with respect to fixed maturity securities is generally to purchase instruments with the expectation of holding them to their maturity however management of the available for sale portfolio is considered necessary to maintain an approximate matching of assets and liabilities as well as to adjust the portfolio as a result of changes in financial market conditions and tax considerations 

the company’s philosophy related to holding or selling fixed maturity securities is based on its objective of maximizing total return the key factors that management considers in its investment decisions as to whether to hold or sell fixed maturity securities are its view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as its expectations regarding interest rates credit spreads and currency values in a period in which management expects interest rates to rise the company may sell longer duration securities in order to mitigate the impact of an interest rate rise on the fair value of the portfolio similarly in a period in which management expects credit spreads to widen the company may sell lower quality securities and in a period in which management expects certain foreign currencies to decline in value the company may sell securities denominated in those foreign currencies the sale of fixed maturity securities in order to achieve the objective of maximizing total return may result in realized gains however there is no reason to expect these gains to continue in future periods

reinsurance 

the company follows customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its exposures in exchange for paying reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies it writes reinsurance is purchased by the company principally to reduce its net liability on individual risks and to protect it against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage the company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and attempts to place its coverages only with substantial and financially sound carriers reinsurance coverage and retentions vary depending on the line of business location of the risk and nature of loss the company’s reinsurance purchases include the following 

 

the company places most of its significant casualty treaties on a “risk attaching” basis under risk attaching treaties all claims from policies incepting during the period of the reinsurance contract are covered even if they occur after the expiration date of the reinsurance contract if the company is unable to renew or replace its existing reinsurance coverage protection for unexpired policies would remain in place until their expiration in such case the company could revise its underwriting strategy for new business to reflect the absence of reinsurance protection property catastrophe and workers’ compensation catastrophe reinsurance is generally placed on a “losses occurring basis” whereby only claims occurring during the period are covered if the company is unable to renew or replace this reinsurance coverage unexpired policies would not be protected 

following is a summary of earned premiums and loss and loss expenses ceded to reinsurers for each of the three years ended december 31 2014

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk  the fair value of the company’s investments is subject to risks of fluctuations in credit quality and interest rates the company uses various models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage interest rate risk the company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate relationship between the average duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities ie policy claims and debt obligations the average duration for the fixed maturity portfolio was 32 and 33 years at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

in addition the fair value of the company’s international investments is subject to currency risk the company attempts to manage its currency risk by matching its foreign currency assets and liabilities where considered appropriate 

the following table outlines the groups of fixed maturity securities and their average duration at december 31 2014  



duration is a common measure of the price sensitivity of fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates the company determines the estimated change in fair value of the fixed maturity securities assuming parallel shifts in 

the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static the estimated fair value at specified levels at december 31 2014  would be as follows 



arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less the company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies including short sales 

additionally the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options selling call options or entering into swap contracts the companys merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among others historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made although the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

we discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience for nonproportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve at december 31 2013 the discount rates by year ranged from 21  to 65  with a weighted average discount rate of 41  for proportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware of 22  the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance is 837 million  867 million  and 892 million  at december 31 2013  2012 and 2011 respectively 

to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations these claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which were subject to significant asbestos or environmental exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute pollution exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language 

our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 36 million  and 34 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012 respectively the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 59 million  and 56 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims increased by approximately 5 million  2 million  and 1 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 3 million 2 million and 3 million in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years 



 

 also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information regarding the decrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2013  as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” in the company’s us regulatory filings is as follows 



1 for statutory purposes the company discounts its workers’ compensation reinsurance reserves at 22  as permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware in its gaap financial statements the company discounts excess workers’ compensation reserves at the riskfree rate and assumed workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate 

the following table presents the development of net reserves for 2003 through 2013 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 

the “cumulative redundancy” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 2003 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 2003 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2013 to 2300 and was settled for 2300 in 2013 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 2003 through 2013 



for certain retrospectively rated insurance polices and reinsurance agreements changes in loss and loss adjustment expenses for prior years are offset by additional or return premiums such premiums are not reflected in the above table 

the following table presents the development of gross reserves for 2003 through 2013 



for certain retrospectively rated insurance polices and reinsurance agreements changes in loss and loss adjustment expenses for prior years are offset by additional or return premiums such premiums are not reflected in the above table 

reinsurance 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 250 million in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

  

us regulation   

our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 

overview  our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums loss expenses and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

holding company statutes  in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase 

the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” adopted amendments to the model holding company law in 2010 expanding upon the regulation of holding company systems the amendments include increased grouplevel reporting requirements submission of an annual enterprise risk report by a regulated insurance companys ultimate controlling person and increased information made accessible to regulators regarding an insurers noninsurers affiliates 

these naic amendments must be adopted by the individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective to date 24 states have adopted the amendments and in order to maintain compliance with naic standards the remaining states must adopt them in whole or substantial part by january 2016 

additionally the naic recently adopted the risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act the “orsa model act” the orsa model act will require an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an own risk and solvency assessment summary report “orsa” the orsa is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks 

the orsa model act must be adopted by the individual state legislature and insurance regulators in order to be effective it is expected that the orsa model act’s requirements generally will become effective in the states on january 1 2015 

we cannot predict the impact if any that these amendments and compliance with the orsa model act will have on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risk based capital requirements  the naic utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the naic rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any rbc action level as of december 31 2013 

insurance regulatory information system  the naic also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the insurance regulatory information system “iris” on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 

guaranty funds  our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a states guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

additionally state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory propertyliability “shared market” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “fair” plans in addition some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 

excess and surplus lines  the regulation of our us subsidiaries excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 

dividends  we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

trade practices  state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers including provisions governing marketing and sales practices policyholder services claims management and complaint handling state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 

investment regulation investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind quality and concentration of investments in general these laws and regulations permit investments in federal state and municipal obligations corporate bonds preferred and common equity securities mortgage loans real estate and certain other investments subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications 

the terrorism risk insurance act the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended “tria” established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism the program is effective through december 31 2014 we cannot be certain that tria will be extended past such expiration date tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism the most recent amendment to tria broadened the definition of certified acts to include domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will pay 85 of an insurers covered losses in excess of the insurers applicable deductible the insurers deductible is based on 20 percent of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2013 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2014 will be approximately 698 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 100 million tria limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

federal regulation   although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways in july 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act created two new federal government bodies the federal insurance office the “fio” and the financial stability oversight council the “fsoc” which may impact the regulation of insurance although the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements it does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance the fio has authority to represent the united states in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the us insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk 

on december 12 2013 the fio delivered a report to congress on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the us the report recommended that in the short term the us system of insurance regulation can be modernized through statebased improvements combined with certain federal actions the report identified areas for direct federal involvement in international standard setting the fio participation in supervisory colleges which monitor the regulation of large national and internationally active insurance groups and federal pursuit of international covered agreements to afford nationally uniform treatment of reinsurance collateral requirements the report also made several recommendations for state reform of insurance regulation including changes to the state regulation of insurance company solvency group supervision and corporate governance the fio report stated that the system of us insurance regulation can be modernized and improved in the shortterm while warning that if the states do not act in the near term to effectively regulate matters on a consistent and cooperative basis in the fio’s view there will be a greater role for federal regulation of insurance 

the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure an insurer so designated by fsoc could be subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards based upon our current business model and balance sheet we do not believe that we will be designated by the fsoc as such an institution although the potential impacts of the doddfrank act on the u s insurance industry is not clear our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

in april 2013 a federal savings association that was indirectly owned by the company sold substantially all of its assets and the company deregistered as a savings and loan holding company 

international regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by the prudential regulation authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca the pras primary objective is to promote the safety and soundness of insurers for the protection of policyholders while the fca has three operational objectives i to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers ii to protect and enhance the integrity of the united kingdom financial system and iii to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers the pra and fca oversee compliance with established periodic auditing and reporting requirements risk assessment reviews minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements dividend restrictions restrictions governing the appointment of key officers restrictions governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements our lloyds syndicate and managing agency are also regulated by the pra fca and lloyds through lloyds we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of lloyds international licenses in each such country we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country additionally pra and fca regulations also impact us as “controller” a prafca defined term of our ukregulated subsidiaries whereby we are required to notify the prafca about significant events relating to their controllers ie persons or entities which have certain levels of influence over the regulated entities as well as changes of control and to submit an annual report regarding their controllers through the prafcas approved persons regime certain employees and directors are subject to regulation by the pra and fca as to their fitness in addition certain employees are individually registered at lloyds 

 in the european union a new insurance regulatory regime governing among other things capital adequacy and risk management called “solvency ii” is scheduled to take effect on january 1 2016 in anticipation of the implementation of solvency ii lloyd’s applies a capital adequacy test to all lloyd’s syndicates including our syndicate that is based on solvency ii principles solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency under solvency ii it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiarys capital position is dependent on the parent company and the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii while it is not certain how or if these actions will impact us we do not currently expect the capital management strategies for our us and international companies will be materially impacted 

our international underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in certain countries in scandinavia continental europe south america australia southeast asia and canada generally our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements while each country imposes licensing solvency auditing and financial reporting requirements the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially key areas where country regulations may differ include i the type of financial reports to be filed ii a requirement to use local intermediaries iii the amount of reinsurance permissible iv the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates and v the type and frequency of regulatory examinations 

competition   

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with many insurance companies of various sizes as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as selfinsured retentions or captive programs transacting business in the united states and internationally we compete directly with a large number of these companies competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit as a result of increased competition from 2005 to 2010 we generally experienced both downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and conditions although insurance rates increased commencing in 2011 certain products continued to experience strong competition 

competition for insurancedomestic business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers our specialty operating units compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers other regional units compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers additionally direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional units by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 

our insuranceinternational operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which in some cases are related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

competition for the reinsuranceglobal business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance partner re and others 

in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or 

existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively 

additionally competition from insurers and reinsurers based in bermuda and other taxadvantaged jurisdictions continues to increase including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreignbased entities in the excess and surplus lines businesses 

employees 

as of january 31 2014 we employed 7247 individuals of this number our subsidiaries employed 7126 persons and the remaining persons were employed at the parent company 

other information about the companys business 

we maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 

seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 

we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues 

compliance by w r berkley and its subsidiaries with federal state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below occur our businesses results of operations andor financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in addition to those described below our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

risks relating to our industry   

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties in demand and pricing causing cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business although the insurance markets have recently hardened somewhat we have faced in recent years increased competition in our business as a result of new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share resulting in decreased premium rates and less favorable contract terms and conditions for certain lines of business the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return have impacted rate adequacy with interest rates remaining at historic lows these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which have reduced premium rates in certain areas and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume   

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided including ease of doing business over the internet speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsuranceglobal business have greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from bermuda or other tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive and pricing advantages 

over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business particularly in our insurancedomestic and reinsuranceglobal segments as increased supply has led to reduced prices and at times less favorable terms and conditions our specialty operating units have also encountered competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share from 2005 through 2010 the property casualty insurance market was very competitive and insurance rates decreased across most business lines although prices have generally increased since the beginning of 2011 current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its longterm return objectives we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and as a result could experience renewed pressure on pricing and policy terms and conditions 

in recent years various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries wellcapitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital provide increasing competition which may adversely impact our business and profitability further an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and as a consequence those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves   

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 101 billion as of december 31 2013 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on managements assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions both inflation overall and medical cost inflation which has historically been greater than inflation overall can have an adverse impact 

reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if 

the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain   

as industry practices and economic legal judicial social and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include but are not limited to 

•   judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability 

•   plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers including us in purported class action litigation relating to claimshandling and other practices 

•   medical developments that link health issues to particular causes resulting in liability claims 

•   claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies including cyber security related risks 

  and 

•   claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions 

in some instances these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies as a result the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued 

in addition the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue to remove limitations on recovery to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business 

the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes   

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results for example weatherrelated losses were 65 million in 2013 80 million in 2012 153 million in 2011 81 million in 2010 and 63 million in 2009 similarly manmade catastrophes can also have a material impact on our financial results 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes tsunamis hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist and other manmade activities including drilling mining and other industrial accidents or terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition or profitability 

there is an emerging scientific view that the earth is getting warmer climate change to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns may affect the frequency and severity of storms and other weather events as well as the affordability availability and underwriting results of commercial property insurance and if frequency and severity patterns increase could negatively affect our financial results 

conditions in the financial markets and the global economy have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if such conditions continue   

the significant volatility and uncertainty experienced in financial markets around the world during the past several years and the effect of the economic downturn have continued although the us and various foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets the ultimate effectiveness of such actions remains unclear therefore volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and the resulting negative economic impact may continue for some time for example financial markets have been affected by concerns over us fiscal policy as well as the related concern regarding the 

need to reduce the federal deficit these issues together with the slowing of the global economy generally could send the us into a new recession further exacerbate concerns over sovereign debt of other countries and disrupt economic activity in the us and elsewhere similarly concerns about the solvency of certain european union member states and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by them has created market volatility that continues to affect the performance of various asset classes and likely will continue until there is an ultimate resolution of these sovereign debt related concerns 

while we monitor conditions in the financial markets we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our results of operations and financial condition depending on conditions in the financial markets we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in future periods and financial market volatility and uncertainty and an economic downturn could have a significant negative impact on third parties that we do business with including insureds and reinsurers 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts   

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended “tria” for up to 85 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2013 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2014 is approximately 698 million tria is currently in effect through december 31 2014 we cannot be certain that tria will be extended past such expiration date in addition the coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

our earnings could be more volatile because of our significant level of retentions   

as compared to a number of our competitors we maintain significant retention levels in premiums written on certain classes of business we purchase less reinsurance the process by which we transfer or cede part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company thereby retaining more risk as a result our earnings could be more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business   

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered in the united states by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

 state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters our insuranceinternational business is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations 

federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to the current conditions in the financial markets and the recent economic downturn may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 

in july 2010 president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant nonbank financial companies including insurance companies be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve the doddfrank act also established a federal insurance office “fio” which is authorized to study monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insureds material financial distress or failure the potential impact of the doddfrank act 

on the us insurance business is not clear our business could be affected by changes whether as a result of the doddfrank act or otherwise to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

although us state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in addition to the changes brought about by the doddfrank act congress has considered over the past years various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarran ferguson act and tax law changes we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution 

with respect to international measures solvency ii the eu directive concerning the capital adequacy risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers which was adopted by the european parliament in april 2009 may affect our insurance businesses implementation of solvency ii in eu member states is currently scheduled to occur on january 1 2016 and may require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance in addition solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers additionally our capital requirements and compliance requirements may be adversely affected if the eu commission finds that the insurance regulatory regimes of the jurisdictions outside the eu in which we have insurance or reinsurance companies domiciled are not equivalent to the requirements of solvency ii 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may further restrict the conduct of our business 

risks relating to our business 

  our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america canada scandinavia asia and australia expose us to increased investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our investments in nonusdenominated securities are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our chairman and ceo president and coo senior executive officers presidents of our operating units experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses   

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2013 the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 1533 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

we are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders independent agents and brokers   

in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business including credit risk relating to policyholders independent agents and brokers 

for example our policyholders independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds 

as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn while we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms our efforts may not be successful for example to reduce such credit risk we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us in cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged andor the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit 

we are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poors or moodys our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a ratings downgrade could also adversely limit our access to capital markets which may increase the cost of debt a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

if conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable which may result from disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so on terms acceptable to us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience difficulties with our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems our ability to conduct our business could be negatively or severely impacted   

our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe terrorist attack or 

industrial accident or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if our business continuity plans or system security does not sufficiently address such a business interruption system failure or service denial our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed 

failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability  

our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks computer viruses hackers employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches in addition we routinely transmit and receive personal confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security while we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these thirdparty vendors and others with whom we do business we may be unable to put in place such secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and in addition these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive information being transferred our failure to protect sensitive personal and our proprietary information whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors could result in significant monetary and reputational damages these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs as a result our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective   

our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting claim processing and investment activities many of which are highly complex these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies as well as legal and regulatory standards including those related to privacy anticorruption antibribery and global finance and insurance matters our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance that the control systems objectives will be met if our controls are not effective it could lead to financial loss unanticipated risk exposure including underwriting credit and investment risk or damage to our reputation 

risks relating to our investments   

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations   

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2013 our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 116 billion or 75 of our total investment portfolio as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 76 state and municipal securities 369 corporate securities 362 mortgagebacked securities 117 and foreign government 76 

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise if significant inflation were to occur the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would be negatively impacted conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations additionally given the historically low interest rate environment we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals 

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession during periods of market disruption it may be difficult to value certain of our securities particularly if trading becomes less frequent andor market data becomes less observable there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment in such cases more securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment 

  although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue the economic downturn has resulted in many states and municipalities operating under deficits or projected 

deficits the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuers ability to perform its obligations thereunder additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the significant volatility experienced in the financial markets economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we invest some of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets which may decline in value   

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity loans and real estate related assets and have recently increased our investments in these asset classes as a result of the current historically low interest rate environment at december 31 2013 our investment in these assets was approximately 26 billion or 17 of our investment portfolio we reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the value of these assets of approximately 6 million in 2013 and 5 million in 2012 

merger and arbitrage trading securities were 522 million or 3 of our investment portfolio at december 31 2013 merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

investments in real estate investment funds and limited partnerships and loans receivable were 14 billion or 9 of our investment portfolio at december 31 2013 the values of our real estate related investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and real estate valuations in particular these investments have been subject to significant volatility as a result of the current conditions in the financial markets in addition our investments in real estate related assets and other alternative investments are less liquid than our other investments 

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts   

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries as well as regulatory restrictions during 2014 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 491 million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations pay dividends or repurchase shares 

laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable and may restrict a stockholders ability to purchase our common stock 

generally united states insurance holding   company laws require that before a person can acquire control of an insurance company prior written approval   must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is   domiciled pursuant to applicable laws and regulations “control” over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person   directly or indirectly owns controls holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 or more of   the voting securities of that insurer indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock thus   the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance operating units are domiciled are likely to   apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common   stock some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to   make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates on the one hand and the target   insurer and its affiliates on the other hand have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state additionally many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements 

while these provisions may not require acquisition approval they can lead to the imposition of conditions on an   acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation   these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control   of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might   consider to be desirable 

certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 

these provisions include 

 these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

w r berkley corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the united states and operates in three business segments insurancedomestic insuranceinternational and reinsuranceglobal our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches it also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics while providing our business units with certain operating autonomy our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital investment reinsurance and enterprise risk management and actuarial financial and corporate legal staff support the company’s primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments 

an important part of our strategy is to form new operating units to capitalize on various business opportunities since 2006 the company formed 24 new operating units that are focused on important parts of the economy in the us including healthcare energy and agriculture and on growing international markets including scandinavia australia the asiapacific region and south america 

the profitability of the company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time an insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural and other disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses general insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity ie the level of statutory capital and surplus employed in the industry and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital 

from 2005 through 2010 the property casualty insurance market was very competitive and insurance rates decreased across most business lines although prices have generally increased since the beginning of 2011 current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its longterm return objectives part of the companys strategy is to selectively reduce its business in areas where it believes returns are not adequate price changes are reflected in the company’s results over time as premiums are earned 

the company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income and investment gains the company’s invested assets which are derived from its own capital and cash flow from its insurance business are invested principally in fixed maturity securities the return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities returns available on fixed maturity investments are at historically low levels the companys investment income has been negatively impacted by the low fixed maturity investment returns and will be further impacted if investment returns remain at this level 

 the company also invests in equity securities merger arbitrage private equity investments investment funds loans receivable and real estate the companys investments in investment funds have experienced and the company expects to continue to experience greater fluctuations in investment income 

critical accounting estimates 

the following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses assumed premiums and otherthantemporary impairments of investments management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments 

reserves for losses and loss expenses    to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature 

and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among other things historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations the company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each operating unit these methods include paid loss development incurred loss development paid and incurred bornhuetterferguson methods and frequency and severity methods in circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others that method is used to set the point estimate for example the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data for new lines of business where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods the actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered industry loss experience is used to supplement the company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the company’s own data is limited the actuarial data is analyzed by line of business coverage and accident or policy year as appropriate for each operating unit 

the establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses these qualitative considerations include among others the impact of reunderwriting initiatives changes in the mix of business changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits the expansion of coverage exclusions whether or not defense costs are within policy limits and changes in deductibles and attachment points 

the key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is written before any actual claims experience has emerged this expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each operating unit expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the longtail lines such as excess casualty and claims with a high medical component such as workers’ compensation reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses and are derived from the company’s own experience and industry data the paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred however different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates 

loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves including expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits retentions rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 

another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses less ibnr is required for lines with short reporting lags as a result loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates for lines with short reporting lags which include commercial automobile primary workers’ compensation other liability claimsmade and property business the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date for lines of business with long reporting lags which include other liability occurrence products liability excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider historically the company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags 

the key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect historical changes current trends and other factors observed if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate the following table reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity relative to our assumptions on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2013 



our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 87 billion as of december 31 2013 relate to multiple accident years therefore the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above 

approximately 16 billion or 18 of the company’s net loss reserves as of december 31 2013 relate to the reinsuranceglobal segment there is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of assumed loss reserves because those estimates are based in part upon information received from ceding companies if information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct the company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate furthermore due to delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is extended management considers the impact of delayed reporting in its selection of assumed loss development factors 

information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business this information which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies the company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the company the information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks 

following is a summary of the company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of december 31 2013 and 2012 

  

following is a summary of the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses by major line of business as of december 31 2013 and 2012 

  

1 reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business are net of an aggregate net discount of 837 million and 867 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the company evaluates reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on a quarterly basis changes in estimates of prior year losses are reported when such changes are made the changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends certain of the companys insurance and reinsurance contracts are retrospectively rated whereby the company collects more or less premiums based on the level of loss activity for those contracts changes in loss and loss adjustment expenses for prior years may be fully or partially offset by additional or return premiums net prior year development ie the sum of prior year reserve changes and prior year earned premiums changes for each of the three years ended december 31 2013 are as follows 

  

  favorable prior year development was 98 million in 2013 compared with 103 in 2012 and 181 in 2011 

favorable development in 2013 was primarily attributable to accident years 2006 through 2012 and included favorable development of 39 million for other liability business 32 million for reinsurance assumed liability business 22 million for workers’ compensation 18 million for commercial property and 24 million for other lines of business the favorable development in 2013 was largely driven by loss cost trends which were more favorable than originally anticipated in particular loss frequency trends have been more favorable than expected for excess  surplus lines casualty business workers compensation and excess of loss professional and other liability business 

the 2013 favorable development was partially offset by unfavorable development of 23 million for commercial automobile business and 14 million for products liability business commercial automobile development was driven by large losses for longhaul trucking business in 2011 and 2012 product liability development stemmed from completed operations losses associated with construction projects in accident years prior to 2009

assumed reinsurance premiums  the company estimates the amount of assumed reinsurance premiums that it will receive under treaty reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contracts these premium estimates are revised as the actual amount of assumed premiums is reported to the company by the ceding companies as estimates of assumed premiums are made or revised the related amount of earned premiums commissions and incurred losses associated with those premiums are recorded estimated assumed premiums receivable were approximately 57 million and 73 million at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively the assumed premium estimates are based upon terms set forth in reinsurance agreements information received from ceding companies during the underwriting and negotiation of agreements reports received from ceding companies and discussions and correspondence with reinsurance intermediaries the company also considers its own view of market conditions economic trends and experience with similar lines of business these premium estimates represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate amount of premiums to be received under its assumed reinsurance agreements 

otherthantemporary impairments otti of investments  the cost of securities is adjusted where appropriate to include a provision for decline in value which is considered to be otherthantemporary an otherthantemporary decline is considered to occur in investments where there has been a sustained reduction in fair value and where the company does not expect the fair value to recover prior to the time of sale or maturity since equity securities do not have a contractual cash flow or maturity the company considers whether the price of an equity security is expected to recover within a reasonable period of time 

the company classifies its fixed maturity securities and preferred stocks by credit rating primarily based on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies for purposes of classifying securities with different ratings the company uses the lower rating if two ratings were assigned and the middle rating if three ratings were assigned unless the company’s own analysis indicates that the lower rating is more appropriate securities that are not rated by a rating agency are evaluated and classified by the company on a casebycase basis 

fixed maturity securities  – for securities that we intend to sell or more likely than not would be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be otti the amount of otti is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value at the balance sheet date for securities that we do not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an otti if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security ie the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 

the portion of the decline in value considered to be a credit loss ie the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security is recognized in earnings the portion of the decline in value not considered to be a credit loss ie the difference in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value of the security is recognized in other comprehensive income 

impairment assessments for structured securities including mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities collateralized debt obligations and corporate debt are generally evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios that may involve subjective judgments and estimates by management modeling these securities involves various factors such as projected default rates the nature and realizable value of the collateral if any the ability of the issuer to make scheduled payments historical performance and other relevant economic and performance factors if an otti determination is made a discounted cash flow analysis is used to ascertain the amount of the credit impairment 

the following table provides a summary of fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position as of december 31 2013 

  

a summary of the company’s noninvestment grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2013 is presented in the table below 

  



  

the company has evaluated its fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and believes the unrealized loss is due primarily to temporary market and sectorrelated factors rather than to issuerspecific factors none of these securities are delinquent or in default under financial covenants based on its assessment of these issuers the company expects them to continue to meet their contractual payment obligations as they become due and does not consider any of these securities to be otti 

preferred stocks  – at december 31 2013  there were three  preferred stocks in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of 33 million  and a gross unrealized loss of 6 million  none of these preferred stocks are rated noninvestment grade and none are delinquent or in default management believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to market and sector related factors and does not consider these to be otti 

common stocks  – at december 31 2013 there were no common stocks in an unrealized loss position 

loans receivable  – the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable including current market conditions for each loan and the ability to collect principal and interest for loans where the company determines it is probable that the contractual terms will not be met an analysis is performed and a valuation reserve is established if necessary with a charge to earnings loans receivable are reported net of a valuation reserve of 2 million and 6 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable and assesses the ability of each borrower to pay principal and interest based upon loan structure underlying property values cash flow and related financial and operating performance

fair value measurements    the company’s fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale and its trading account securities are carried at fair value fair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date” the company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available the fair value of the vast majority of the company’s portfolio is based on observable data other than quoted prices and accordingly is classified as level 2 

in classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy the company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable the company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information the company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers the uninterrupted availability of such inputs the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time if the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable the security is categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers and reference data quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions for publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable the company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data for securities traded only in private negotiations the company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer financial data projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information 

the following is a summary of pricing sources for the companys fixed maturity securities available for sale as of december 31 2013

syndicate manager  – the company has a 15 participation in a lloyd’s syndicate and the company’s share of the securities owned by the syndicate is priced by the syndicate’s manager the majority of the securities are liquid short duration 

fixed maturity securities the company reviews the syndicate manager’s pricing methodology and audited financial statements and holds discussions with the syndicate manager as necessary to confirm its understanding and agreement with security prices based upon the company’s review of the methodologies used by the syndicate manager these securities were classified as level 2 

observable data  – if independent pricing is not available the company prices the securities directly prices are based on observable market data where available including current trading levels for similar securities and nonbinding quotations from brokers the company generally requests two or more quotes if more than one quote is received the company sets a price within the range of quotes received based on its assessment of the credibility of the quote and its own evaluation of the security the company generally does not adjust quotes obtained from brokers since these securities were priced based on observable data they were classified as level 2 

cash flow model  – if the above methodologies are not available the company prices securities using a discounted cash flow model based upon assumptions as to prevailing credit spreads interest rates and interest rate volatility time to maturity and subordination levels discount rates are adjusted to reflect illiquidity where appropriate these securities were classified as level 3

as a holding company the company derives cash from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends tax payments and management fees maximum amounts of dividends that our insurance companies can pay without regulatory approval are prescribed by statute during 2014 the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 491 million the ability of the holding company to service its debt obligations is limited by the ability of its insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in the event dividends tax payments and management fees available to the holding company were inadequate to service its debt obligations the company would need to raise capital sell assets or restructure its debt obligations 

the companys insurance subsidiaries principal sources of cash are premiums investment income service fees and proceeds from sales and maturities of portfolio investments the principal uses of cash are payments for claims taxes operating expenses and dividends the company expects its insurance subsidiaries to fund the payment of losses with cash received from premiums investment income and fees the company generally has targeted an average duration for its investment portfolio that is within one year of the average duration of its liabilities so that portions of its investment portfolio mature throughout the claim cycle and are available for the payment of claims if necessary in the event operating cash flow and proceeds from maturities and prepayments of fixed income securities are not sufficient to fund claim payments and other cash requirements the remainder of the companys cash and investments is available to pay claims and other obligations as they become due the companys investment portfolio is highly liquid with approximately 80 invested in cash cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities as of december 31 2013 if the sale of fixed maturity securities were to become necessary a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the cost and sales price of securities sold would be recognized

federal and foreign income taxes 

the company files a consolidated income tax return in the us and foreign tax returns in each of the countries in which it has overseas operations at december 31 2013  the company had a deferred gross tax asset of 431 million which primarily relates to loss and loss expense reserves and unearned premium reserves and a gross deferred tax liability of 411 million which primarily relates to deferred policy acquisition costs and unrealized investment gains the realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the companys ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods based on historical results and the prospects for future operations management anticipates that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient for the realization of this asset 

the company has not provided us deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of approximately 103 million of its nonus subsidiaries since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the nonus subsidiaries however in the future if such earnings were distributed to the company taxes of approximately 9 million assuming all tax credits are realized would be payable on such undistributed earnings and would be reflected in the tax provision for the year in which these earnings are no longer intended to be permanently reinvested in the foreign subsidiary 

reinsurance 

the company follows customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its exposures in exchange for paying reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies it writes reinsurance is purchased by the company principally to reduce its net liability on individual risks and to protect it against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage the company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and attempts to place its coverages only with substantial and financially sound carriers reinsurance coverage and retentions vary depending on the line of business location of the risk and nature of loss the company’s reinsurance purchases include the following 

 

the company places most of its significant casualty treaties on a “risk attaching” basis under risk attaching treaties all claims from policies incepting during the period of the reinsurance contract are covered even if they occur after the expiration date of the reinsurance contract if the company is unable to renew or replace its existing reinsurance coverage protection for unexpired policies would remain in place until their expiration in such case the company could revise its underwriting strategy for new business to reflect the absence of reinsurance protection property catastrophe and workers’ compensation catastrophe reinsurance is generally placed on a “losses occurring basis” whereby only claims occurring during the period are covered if the company is unable to renew or replace this reinsurance coverage unexpired policies would not be protected 

following is a summary of earned premiums and loss and loss expenses ceded to reinsurers for each of the three years ended december 31 2013 

  



  

ceded earned premiums increased 17 in 2013 to 960 million the increase was higher than the increase in direct and assumed earned premiums of 13 due primarily to growth in assigned risk plan business which is fully reinsured and to an increase in ceded premiums for professional liability business the ceded losses and loss expenses ratio decreased 63 points to 580 in 2013 from 643 in 2012 ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses in 2012 included 134 million of reinsurance loss recoveries related to superstorm sandy

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk  the fair value of the company’s investments is subject to risks of fluctuations in credit quality and interest rates the company uses various models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage interest rate risk the company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate relationship between the average duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities ie policy claims and debt obligations the average duration for the fixed maturity portfolio was 33 and 34 years at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

in addition the fair value of the company’s international investments is subject to currency risk the company attempts to manage its currency risk by matching its foreign currency assets and liabilities where considered appropriate 

the following table outlines the groups of fixed maturity securities and their average duration at december 31 2013  



duration is a common measure of the price sensitivity of fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates the company determines the estimated change in fair value of the fixed maturity securities assuming parallel shifts in 

the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static the estimated fair value at specified levels at december 31 2013  would be as follows 



arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less the company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies including short sales 

additionally the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options selling call options or entering into swap contracts the companys merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among others historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made although the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

we discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience for nonproportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve at december 31 2012 the discount rates by year ranged from 21  to 65  with a weighted average discount rate of 42  for proportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware of 22  the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance is 867 million  892 million  and 898 million  at december 31 2012  2011 and 2010 respectively 

to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations these claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which were subject to significant asbestos or environmental exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute pollution exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language 

our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 34 million   at both december 31 2012  and 2011 the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos 

and environmental claims were 56 million  and 59 million  at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims increased by approximately 2 million  1 million  and 2 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 2 million 3 million and 2 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years 



 

 also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information regarding the decrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2012  as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” in the company’s us regulatory filings is as follows 



1 for statutory purposes the company discounts its workers’ compensation reinsurance reserves at 22  as permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware in its gaap financial statements the 

company discounts excess workers’ compensation reserves at the riskfree rate and assumed workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate 

the following table presents the development of net reserves for 2002 through 2012 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 

the “cumulative redundancy deficiency” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 2002 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 2002 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2012 to 2300 and was settled for 2300 in 2012 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 2002 through 2011 



the following table presents the development of gross reserves for 2002 through 2012 



reinsurance 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 250 million in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

  

us regulation 

  

our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 

overview  our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums loss expenses and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

  

holding company statutes  in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems typically such statutes require that we periodically file 

information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase under alabama law which is applicable to us due to our ownership of american mining insurance company inc an alabama domiciled insurance company the acquisition of more than 5 of our capital stock is subject to prior regulatory approval 

the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” adopted amendments to the model holding company law in 2010 expanding upon the regulation of holding company systems the amendments include increased grouplevel reporting requirements submission of an annual enterprise risk report by a regulated insurance companys ultimate controlling person and increased information made accessible to regulators regarding an insurers noninsurers affiliates 

  

risk based capital requirements  the naic utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the naic rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any rbc action level as of december 31 2012 

  

insurance regulatory information system  the naic also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the insurance regulatory information system “iris” on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 

  

guaranty funds  our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a states guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

additionally state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory propertyliability “shared market” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “fair” plans in addition some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 

  

excess and surplus lines  the regulation of our us subsidiaries excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 

  

dividends  we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

  

trade practices  state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers including provisions governing marketing and sales practices policyholder services claims management and complaint handling state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 

investment regulation investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind quality and concentration of investments in general these laws and regulations permit investments in federal state and municipal obligations corporate bonds preferred and common equity securities mortgage loans real estate and certain other investments subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications 

  

the terrorism risk insurance act the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended collectively “tria” established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism the program is effective through december 31 2014 we cannot be certain that tria will be extended past such expiration date tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism the most recent amendment to tria broadened the definition of certified acts to include domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will pay 85 of an insurers covered losses in excess of the insurers applicable deductible the insurers deductible is based on 20 percent of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2012 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2013 will be approximately 618 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 100 million tria limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

federal regulation   although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways in july 2010 president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act created two new federal government bodies the federal insurance office the “fio” and the financial stability oversight council the “fsoc” which may impact the regulation of insurance although the fio is prohibited from directly regulating the business of insurance it has authority to represent the united states in international insurance matters and has limited powers to preempt certain types of state insurance laws the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure an insurer so designated by fsoc could be subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards based upon our current business model and balance sheet we do not believe that we will be designated by the fsoc as such an institution although the potential impacts of the doddfrank act on the u s insurance industry is not clear our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

in addition as a result of its direct and indirect majority ownership interest in peyton street independent financial services corporation a thrift holding company peyton street and indirect majority ownership stake in insurbanc a federal savings bank insurbanc w r berkley corporation is a savings and loan holding company and under the doddfrank act is subject to the oversight of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve insurbanc has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its assets and deposit liabilities following which both peyton street and insurbanc would proceed to liquidate and each of peyton street and w r berkley corporation would deregister as a savings and loan holding company the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2013 subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions as a savings and loan holding company w r berkley corporation may be subject to certain prior notification requirements restrictions on dividends stock repurchases and distributions transactions with affiliates and compensation plans and additional requirements related to its shareholders management reporting and capital adequacy if the debanking were not to occur as anticipated or until it takes such other actions to terminate w r berkley corporations status as a savings and loan holding company 

international regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by the financial services authority the “fsa” the fsa oversees compliance with established periodic auditing and reporting requirements risk assessment reviews minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements dividend restrictions restrictions governing the appointment of key officers restrictions governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements our lloyds syndicate and managing agency are also regulated by the fsa and lloyds through lloyds we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of lloyds international licenses in each such country we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country additionally fsa regulations also impact us as “controller” an fsa defined term of our ukregulated subsidiaries whereby we are required to notify the fsa about significant events relating to their controllers ie persons or entities which have certain levels of influence over the regulated entities as well as changes of control and to submit an annual report regarding their controllers through the fsas approved persons regime certain employees and directors are subject to regulation by the fsa as to their fitness in addition certain employees are individually registered at lloyds 

 the european unions executive body the european commission is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called “solvency ii” that already applies to our lloyds syndicate and would apply to our businesses across the european union beginning on january 1 2014 solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency under solvency ii it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiarys capital position is dependent on the parent company and the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii while it is not certain how or if these actions will impact us we do not currently expect the capital management strategies for our us and international companies will be materially impacted 

our international underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in certain countries in scandinavia continental europe south america australia southeast asia and canada generally our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements while each country imposes licensing solvency auditing and financial reporting requirements the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially key areas where country regulations may differ include i the type of financial reports to be filed ii a requirement to use local intermediaries iii the amount of reinsurance permissible iv the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates and v the type and frequency of regulatory examinations 

competition 

  

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with many insurance companies of various sizes as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as selfinsured retentions or captive programs transacting business in the united states and internationally we compete directly with a large number of these companies competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit as a result of increased competition from 2005 to 2010 we generally experienced both downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and conditions although insurance rates increased commencing in 2011 certain products continued to experience strong competition 

competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers our specialty companies compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers 

  

competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance partner re and others 

  

our regional subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers additionally direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 

  

our international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which in some cases are related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

  

additionally competition from insurers and reinsurers based in bermuda and other tax advantaged jurisdictions continues to increase including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign based entities in the excess and surplus lines businesses 

  employees 

  

as of february 14 2013 we employed 7412 individuals of this number our subsidiaries employed 7298 persons and the remaining 114 persons were employed at the parent company

we maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 

  

seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 

  

we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our businesses results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in addition to those described below our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

risks relating to our industry 

  

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties in demand and pricing causing cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business although the insurance markets currently are beginning to harden we have faced in recent years increased competition in our business as a result of new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share resulting in decreased premium rates and less favorable contract terms and conditions the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on 

the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return have impacted rate adequacy and the federal reserve has indicated its intention to keep interest rates at historic lows through late 2014 these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which have reduced premium rates and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume 

  

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies some of which have implicit or explicit government support competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided including ease of doing business over the internet speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written 

  

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from bermuda or other tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive and pricing advantages 

  

over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business particularly in our reinsurance and specialty segments as increased supply has led to reduced prices and at times less favorable terms and conditions our specialty segment has also encountered competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share although policy rates and terms for certain of these lines of business generally stabilized or showed modest improvements starting in 2011 we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and as a result could experience renewed pressure on pricing and policy terms and conditions 

  

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves 

  

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 10 billion as of december 31 2012 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

  

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on managements assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

  

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions both inflation overall and medical cost inflation which has historically been greater than inflation overall 

can have an adverse impact reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

  

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain   

as industry practices and economic legal judicial social and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include but are not limited to 

•   judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability 

 

•   medical developments that link health issues to particular causes resulting in liability claims 

•   claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies including cyber security related risks 

  and 

•   claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions 

in some instances these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies as a result the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued 

in addition the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue to remove limitations on recovery to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business 

the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes 

  

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results for example weatherrelated losses were 80 million in 2012 153 million in 2011 81 million in 2010 63 million in 2009 and 114 million in 2008 similarly manmade catastrophes can also have a material impact on our financial results 

  

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes tsunamis hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist and other manmade activities including drilling mining and other industrial accidents or terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms 

seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition or profitability 

  

there is an emerging scientific view that the earth is getting warmer climate change to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns may affect the frequency and severity of storms and other weather events as well as the affordability availability and underwriting results of commercial property insurance and if frequency and severity patterns increase could negatively affect our financial results 

conditions in the financial markets and the global economy have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if such conditions continue 

  

the significant volatility and uncertainty experienced in financial markets around the world during the past several years and the effect of the economic downturn have continued although the us and various foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets the ultimate effectiveness of such actions remains unclear therefore volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and the resulting negative economic impact may continue for some time for example financial markets have been affected by concerns over us fiscal policy as well as the related concern regarding the need to reduce the federal deficit these issues together with the slowing of the global economy generally could send the us into a new recession further exacerbate concerns over sovereign debt of other countries and disrupt economic activity in the us and elsewhere similarly recent concerns about the solvency of certain european union member states and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by them has created market volatility that continues to affect the performance of various asset classes and likely will continue until there is an ultimate resolution of these sovereign debt related concerns 

  

while we monitor conditions in the financial markets we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our results of operations and financial condition depending on conditions in the financial markets we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in future periods and financial market volatility and uncertainty and an economic downturn could have a significant negative impact on third parties that we do business with including insureds and reinsurers 

  

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts 

  

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended “tria” for up to 85 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2012 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2013 is approximately 618 million tria is currently in effect through december 31 2014 we cannot be certain that tria will be extended past such expiration date in addition the coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

  

our earnings could be more volatile because of our significant level of retentions 

  

as compared to a number of our competitors we maintain significant retention levels in premiums written we purchase less reinsurance the process by which we transfer or cede part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company thereby retaining more risk as a result our earnings could be more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 

  

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered in the united states by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

• standards of solvency including riskbased capital measurements 

• restrictions on the nature quality and concentration of investments 

• requirements pertaining to certain methods of accounting 

• rate and form regulation pertaining to certain of our insurance businesses 

 

 

state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters our international business is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations 

federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to the current conditions in the financial markets and the recent economic downturn may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 

in july 2010 president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant nonbank financial companies including insurance companies be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve the doddfrank act also established a federal insurance office “fio” and authorized the federal preemption of certain state insurance laws fsoc and the fio are authorized to study monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market the potential impact of the doddfrank act on the us insurance business is not clear our business could be affected by changes whether as a result of the doddfrank act or otherwise to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

as a result of its direct and indirect majority ownership interest in peyton street independent financial services corporation a thrift holding company and indirect majority ownership stake in insurbanc a federal savings bank 

w r berkley corporation is a savings and loan holding company and under the doddfrank act is subject to the oversight of the federal reserve insurbanc has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its assets and deposit liabilities following which both peyton street and insurbanc would proceed to liquidate and each of peyton street and w r berkley corporation would deregister as a savings and loan holding company the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2013 subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions as a savings and loan holding company w r berkley corporation may be subject to certain prior notification requirements restrictions on dividends stock repurchases and distributions transactions with affiliates and compensation plans and additional requirements related to its shareholders management reporting and capital adequacy if the debanking were not to occur as anticipated or until it takes such other actions to terminate w r berkley corporations status as a savings and loan holding company 

although us state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in addition to the changes brought about by the doddfrank act congress has considered over the past years various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarran ferguson act and tax law changes we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution 

  

with respect to international measures solvency ii the eu directive concerning the capital adequacy risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers which was adopted by the european parliament in april 2009 may affect our insurance businesses implementation of solvency ii in eu member states which already applies to our lloyds syndicate and is currently scheduled to occur on january 1 2014 may require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance in addition solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the 

capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers additionally our capital requirements may be adversely affected if the eu commission finds that the insurance regimes of our thirdcountry domiciled companies are not equivalent to the requirements of solvency ii 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may further restrict the conduct of our business 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america australia the asiapacific region scandinavia and canada expose us to increased investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our investments in nonusdenominated securities are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our chairman and ceo president and coo senior executive officers presidents of our operating units experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses 

  

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2012 the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 1450 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

we are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders independent agents and brokers   

in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business including credit risk relating to policyholders independent agents and brokers for example our policyholders independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds 

as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn while we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines collateral requirements and other oversight 

mechanisms our efforts may not be successful for example to reduce such credit risk we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us in cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged andor the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit 

we are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys investors our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poors or moodys our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a ratings downgrade could also adversely limit our access to capital markets which may increase the cost of debt a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

if conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable which may result from disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so on terms acceptable to us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience difficulties with our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems our ability to conduct our business could be negatively or severely impacted   

our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe terrorist attack or industrial accident or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if our business continuity plans or system security does not sufficiently address such a business interruption system failure or service denial our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed 

failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability  

our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks computer viruses hackers employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches in addition we routinely transmit and receive personal confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security while we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these thirdparty vendors and others with whom we do business we may be unable to put in place such secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and in addition these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive information being transferred our failure to protect sensitive personal and our proprietary information whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors could result in significant monetary and reputational damages these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs as a result our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective   

  

our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting claim processing and investment activities many of which are highly complex these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies as well as legal and regulatory standards including those related to privacy anticorruption antibribery and global finance and insurance matters our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance that the control systems objectives will be met if our controls are not effective it could lead to financial loss unanticipated risk exposure including underwriting credit and investment risk or damage to our reputation 

risks relating to our investments 

  

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations 

  

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2012 our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 119 billion or 76 of our total investment portfolio as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 75 state and municipal securities 405 corporate securities 281 mortgagebacked securities 146 and foreign government and corporate bonds 93 

  

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise if significant inflation were to occur the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would be negatively impacted conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations additionally given the historically low interest rate 

environment we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals 

  

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession during periods of market disruption it may be difficult to value certain of our securities particularly if trading becomes less frequent andor market data becomes less observable there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment in such cases more securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment 

  although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue the economic downturn has resulted in many states and municipalities operating under deficits or projected deficits the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuers ability to perform its obligations thereunder additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

  

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the significant volatility experienced in the financial markets economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we invest some of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity and real estate related assets which may decline in value 

  

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity and real estate related assets and have recently increased our investments in these asset classes as a result of the current historically low interest rate environment at december 31 2012 our investment in these assets was approximately 28 billion or 18 of our investment portfolio we reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the value of these assets of approximately 5 million in 2012 400000 in 2011 and 9 million in 2010 and losses from investment funds of 6 million in 2010 

  

merger and arbitrage trading securities were 718 million or 5 of our investment portfolio at december 31 2012 merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

  

investments in real estate investment funds and limited partnerships and loans receivable were 1351 million or 9 of our investment portfolio at december 31 2012 the values of our real estate related investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and real estate valuations in particular these investments have been subject to significant volatility as a result of the current conditions in the financial markets in addition our investments in real estate related assets and other alternative investments are less liquid than our other investments 

  

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

  

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts 

  

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for 

paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries as well as regulatory restrictions during 2013 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 466 million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations pay dividends or repurchase shares 

laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable and may restrict a stockholders ability to purchase our common stock 

generally united states insurance holding   company laws require that before a person can acquire control of an insurance company prior written approval   must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is   domiciled pursuant to applicable laws and regulations “control” over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person   directly or indirectly owns controls holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 or more of   the voting securities of that insurer 5 for alabama domiciled insurers such as us due to our ownership of american mining insurance indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock thus   the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance operating units are domiciled are likely to   apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common   stock some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to   make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates on the one hand and the target   insurer and its affiliates on the other hand have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state additionally many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements 

while these provisions may not require acquisition approval they can lead to the imposition of conditions on an   acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation   these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control   of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might   consider to be desirable 

certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

  

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 

  

these provisions include 

 

 

• the need for advance notice in order to raise business or make nominations at stockholders meetings 

these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

w r berkley corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the united states and operates in five business segments specialty regional alternative markets reinsurance and international our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches it also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics while providing our business units with certain operating autonomy our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital investment reinsurance and enterprise risk management and actuarial financial and corporate legal staff support the company’s primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments 

an important part of our strategy is to form new operating units to capitalize on various business opportunities with 23 of our 48 units formed since 2006 these newer units are focused on important parts of the economy in the us including healthcare energy and agriculture and on growing international markets including scandinavia australia the asiapacific region and south america as a result our international operations have become an increasingly important part of our business 

the profitability of the company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time an insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural and other disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses general insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity ie the level of policyholders’ surplus employed in the industry and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital 

beginning in 2005 the property casualty insurance market became more competitive and insurance rates decreased across most business lines increased competition and the impact of the economic downturn also put pressure on policy terms and conditions while prices increased in 2012 loss costs are also increasing and current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its longterm return objectives with its investments in new businesses the company believes it is wellpositioned to take advantage of new opportunities price changes are reflected in the company’s results over time as premiums are earned 

the company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income and investment gains the company’s invested assets which are derived from its own capital and cash flow from its insurance business are invested principally in fixed maturity securities the return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates which are at historically low levels as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities the company also invests in equity securities merger arbitrage private equity investments investment funds and real estate the companys investments in investment funds have experienced and the company expects to continue to experience greater fluctuations in investment income 

critical accounting estimates 

the following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses assumed premiums and otherthantemporary impairments of investments management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments 

reserves for losses and loss expenses    to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but 

not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among other things historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations the company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each operating unit these methods include paid loss development incurred loss development paid and incurred bornhuetterferguson methods and frequency and severity methods in circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others that method is used to set the point estimate for example the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data for new lines of business where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods the actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered industry loss experience is used to supplement the company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the company’s own data is limited the actuarial data is analyzed by line of business coverage and accident or policy year as appropriate for each operating unit 

the establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses these qualitative considerations include among others the impact of reunderwriting initiatives changes in the mix of business changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits the expansion of coverage exclusions whether or not defense costs are within policy limits and changes in deductibles and attachment points 

the key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is written before any actual claims experience has emerged this expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each operating unit expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the longtail lines such as excess casualty and claims with a high medical component such as workers’ compensation reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses and are derived from the company’s own experience and industry data the paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred however different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates 

loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves including expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits retentions rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 

another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses less ibnr is required for lines with short reporting lags as a result loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates for lines with short reporting lags which include commercial automobile primary workers’ compensation other liability claimsmade and property business the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date for lines of business with long reporting lags which include other liability occurrence products liability excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider historically the company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags 

the key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect historical changes current trends and other factors observed if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate the following table reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity relative to our assumptions on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2012 dollars in thousands 



our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 84 billion as of december 31 2012 relate to multiple accident years therefore the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above 

approximately 14 billion or 16 of the company’s net loss reserves as of december 31 2012 relate to the reinsurance segment there is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of assumed loss reserves because those estimates are based in part upon information received from ceding companies if information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct the company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate furthermore due to delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is extended management considers the impact of delayed reporting in its selection of assumed loss development factors 

information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business this information which is generally provided to the company through reinsurance intermediaries is gathered by the company through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies the company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the company the information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks 

following is a summary of the company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of december 31 2012 and 2011 

  

following is a summary of the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses by major line of business as of december 31 2012 and 2011 

  

reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business are net of an aggregate net discount of 867 million and 892 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the following table presents development in our estimate of claims occurring in prior years 

  

  

for the year ended december 31 2012 estimates for claims occurring in prior years decreased by 103 million the favorable reserve development in 2012 was primarily attributable to accident years 2008 through 2010 the changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends 

specialty   the majority of the favorable reserve development for the specialty segment during 2012 and 2011 was associated with excess and surplus “es” casualty business es insurers are free from rate and form regulation and generally charge higher rates for business than those that are charged in the “standard” market beginning in 2002 the es business began to experience improved claim frequency ie a lower number of reported claims per unit of exposure one reason for the lower number of claims was the company’s introduction of more restrictive policy language which included additional exclusions that eliminated claims that would have previously been covered in addition as standard carriers tightened their underwriting criteria the company benefited from an influx of accounts from the standard market to the es market during these years the more restrictive policy language and the influx of standard market business resulted in an improved risk profile within the es business and a reduction in loss costs that was not expected at the time loss reserves were initially established in addition loss severity trends for es casualty business have been lower than we had initially expected for the 2005 to 2009 period we began to recognize these trends in 2007 and have continued to reduce our estimates of ultimate claim costs since then as the magnitude of the frequency trends has become more evident the favorable reserve development in 2012 was primarily attributable to accident years 2007 through 2010 

regional   favorable reserve development for the regional segment related to workers compensation business and the liability portion of commercial multiperil business partially offset by modest adverse development on commercial automobile business the favorable development for commercial multiperil business related primarily to the 2008 and 2009 accident years and resulted mainly from lower loss emergence on known case reserves relative to historical levels the adverse development on commercial automobile was related to commercial transportation business written by our regional companies for accident years 2010 and 2011 

reinsurance   the favorable development for the reinsurance segment was related to the companys minority participation in a lloyd’s syndicate the favorable development was concentrated in underwriting years 2008 through 2011 and resulted from lower than expected reported losses 

loss reserve discount   the company discounts its liabilities for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience for nonproportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve for proportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware of 22 as of december 31 2012 the discount rates by year ranged from 21 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 42 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 867 million and 892 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

assumed reinsurance premiums  the company estimates the amount of assumed reinsurance premiums that it will receive under treaty reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contracts these premium estimates are revised as the actual amount of assumed premiums is reported to the company by the ceding companies as estimates of assumed premiums are made or revised the related amount of earned premiums commissions and incurred losses associated with those premiums are 

recorded estimated assumed premiums receivable were approximately 73 million and 64 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the assumed premium estimates are based upon terms set forth in reinsurance agreements information received from ceding companies during the underwriting and negotiation of agreements reports received from ceding companies and discussions and correspondence with reinsurance intermediaries the company also considers its own view of market conditions economic trends and experience with similar lines of business these premium estimates represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate amount of premiums to be received under its assumed reinsurance agreements 

otherthantemporary impairments otti of investments  the cost of securities is adjusted where appropriate to include a provision for decline in value which is considered to be otherthantemporary an otherthantemporary decline is considered to occur in investments where there has been a sustained reduction in fair value and where the company does not expect the fair value to recover prior to the time of sale or maturity since equity securities do not have a contractual cash flow or maturity the company considers whether the price of an equity security is expected to recover within a reasonable period of time 

the company classifies its fixed maturity securities and preferred stocks by credit rating primarily based on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies for purposes of classifying securities with different ratings the company uses the lower rating if two ratings were assigned and the middle rating if three ratings were assigned unless the company’s own analysis indicates that the lower rating is more appropriate securities that are not rated by a rating agency are evaluated and classified by the company on a casebycase basis 

fixed maturity securities  – for securities that we intend to sell or more likely than not would be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be otti the amount of otti is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value at the balance sheet date for securities that we do not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an otti if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security ie the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 

the portion of the decline in value considered to be a credit loss ie the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security is recognized in earnings the portion of the decline in value not considered to be a credit loss ie the difference in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value of the security is recognized in other comprehensive income 

impairment assessments for structured securities including mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities collateralized debt obligations and corporate debt are generally evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios that may involve subjective judgments and estimates by management modeling these securities involves various factors such as projected default rates the nature and realizable value of the collateral if any the ability of the issuer to make scheduled payments historical performance and other relevant economic and performance factors if an otti determination is made a discounted cash flow analysis is used to ascertain the amount of the credit impairment 

the following table provides a summary of fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position as of december 31 2012 

  

a summary of the company’s noninvestment grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2012 is presented in the table below 

  



  

the company has evaluated its fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and believes the unrealized loss is due primarily to temporary market and sectorrelated factors rather than to issuerspecific factors none of these securities are delinquent or in default under financial covenants based on its assessment of these issuers the company expects them to continue to meet their contractual payment obligations as they become due and does not consider any of these securities to be otti 

preferred stocks  – at december 31 2012  there were two  preferred stocks in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of 40 million  and a gross unrealized loss of 2 million  one  of those preferred stocks with an aggregate fair value of 15 million  and a gross unrealized loss of 1 million  is rated noninvestment grade neither of these securities are delinquent or in default management believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to market and sector related factors and does not consider these to be otti 

common stocks  – at december 31 2012 the company owned three common stocks in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of 47 million and an aggregate unrealized loss of 1 million the company does not consider these common stocks to be otti 

loans receivable  – the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable including current market conditions for each loan and the ability to collect principal and interest for loans where the company determines it is probable that the contractual terms will not be met an analysis is performed and a valuation reserve is established if necessary with a charge to earnings loans receivable are reported net of a valuation reserve of 6 million and 20 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable and assesses the ability of the borrower to pay principal and interest based upon loan structure underlying property values cash flow and related financial and operating performance of the property and market conditions loans receivable with a potential for default are further assessed using discounted cash flow analysis and comparable cost and sales methodologies if appropriate 

fair value measurements    the company’s fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale and its trading account securities are carried at fair value fair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date” the company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available the fair value of the vast majority of the company’s portfolio is based on observable data other than quoted prices and accordingly is classified as level 2 

in classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy the company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable the company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information the company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers the uninterrupted availability of such inputs the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time if the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable the security is categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers and reference data quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions for publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable the company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data for securities traded only in private negotiations the company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer financial data projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information 

the following is a summary of pricing sources for the companys fixed maturity securities available for sale as of december 31 2012 

  

independent pricing services   the vast majority of the company’s fixed maturity securities available for sale were priced by independent pricing services generally one us pricing service plus additional pricing services with respect to a limited number of foreign securities held by the company the prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets eg broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities the determination of whether markets are active or inactive is based upon the volume and level of activity for a particular asset class the company reviews the prices provided by pricing services for reasonableness based upon current trading levels for similar securities if the prices appear unusual to the company they are reexamined and the value is either confirmed or revised in addition the company periodically performs independent price tests of a sample of securities to ensure proper valuation and to verify our understanding of how securities are priced as of december 31 2012 the company did not make any adjustments to the prices provided by the pricing services based upon the company’s review of the methodologies used by the independent pricing services these securities were classified as level 2 

syndicate manager  – the company has a 15 participation in a lloyd’s syndicate and the company’s share of the securities owned by the syndicate is priced by the syndicate’s manager the majority of the securities are liquid short duration fixed maturity securities the company reviews the syndicate manager’s pricing methodology and audited financial statements and holds discussions with the syndicate manager as necessary to confirm its understanding and agreement with security prices based upon the company’s review of the methodologies used by the syndicate manager these securities were classified as level 2 

observable data  – if independent pricing is not available the company prices the securities directly prices are based on observable market data where available including current trading levels for similar securities and nonbinding quotations from brokers the company generally requests two or more quotes if more than one quote is received the company sets a price within the range of quotes received based on its assessment of the credibility of the quote and its own evaluation of the security the company generally does not adjust quotes obtained from brokers since these securities were priced based on observable data they were classified as level 2 

cash flow model  – if the above methodologies are not available the company prices securities using a discounted cash flow model based upon assumptions as to prevailing credit spreads interest rates and interest rate volatility time to maturity and subordination levels discount rates are adjusted to reflect illiquidity where appropriate these securities were classified as level 3

income taxes  the effective income tax rate was 24 in 2011 as compared to 25 in 2010 the effective income tax rate differs from the federal income tax rate of 35 primarily because of taxexempt investment income and utilization of foreign tax credits including a reduction of the valuation allowance tax exempt investment income comprised a higher portion of the 2011 pretax income and as such had a higher impact on the effective tax rate for 2011 compared with 2010 

investments 

as part of its investment strategy the company establishes a level of cash and highly liquid shortterm and intermediateterm securities that combined with expected cash flow it believes is adequate to meet its payment obligations 

the company also attempts to maintain an appropriate relationship between the average duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities ie policy claims and debt obligations the average duration of the investment portfolio was 34 years and 36 years at december 31 2012  and 2011 respectively the company’s investment portfolio and investmentrelated assets as of december 31 2012  were as follows 

  



  

 

fixed maturity securities  the company’s investment policy with respect to fixed maturity securities is generally to purchase instruments with the expectation of holding them to their maturity however management of the available for sale portfolio is considered necessary to maintain an approximate matching of assets and liabilities as well as to adjust the portfolio as a result of changes in financial market conditions and tax considerations 

the company’s philosophy related to holding or selling fixed maturity securities is based on its objective of maximizing total return the key factors that management considers in its investment decisions as to whether to hold or sell fixed maturity securities are its view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as its expectations regarding interest rates credit spreads and currency values in a period in which management expects interest rates to rise the company may sell longer duration securities in order to mitigate the impact of an interest rate rise on the fair value of the portfolio similarly in a period in which management expects credit spreads to widen the company may sell lower quality securities and in a period in which management expects certain foreign currencies to decline in value the company may sell securities denominated in those foreign currencies the sale of fixed maturity securities in order to achieve the objective of maximizing total return may result in realized gains however there is no reason to expect these gains to continue in future periods 

at december 31 2012 investments in foreign fixed maturity securities were as follows

liquidity and capital resources 

  cash flow  cash flow provided from operating activities increased to 675 million in 2012 from 670 million in 2011 the increase in cash flow was due primarily to higher premium collections partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid paid losses as a percent of earned premiums were 580 in 2012 compared with 598 in 2011 

as a holding company the company derives cash from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends tax payments and management fees maximum amounts of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval are prescribed by statute during 2013 the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 466 million the ability of the holding company to service its debt obligations is limited by the ability of its insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in the event dividends tax payments and management fees available to the holding company were inadequate to service its debt obligations the company would need to raise capital sell assets or restructure its debt obligations 

the companys insurance subsidiaries principal sources of cash are premiums investment income service fees and proceeds from sales and maturities of portfolio investments the principal uses of cash are payments for claims taxes operating expenses and dividends the company expects its insurance subsidiaries to fund the payment of losses with cash received from premiums investment income and fees the company generally has targeted an average duration for its investment portfolio that is within one year of the average duration of its liabilities so that portions of its investment portfolio mature throughout the claim cycle and are available for the payment of claims if necessary in the event operating cash flow and proceeds from maturities and prepayments of fixed income securities are not sufficient to fund claim payments and other cash requirements the remainder of the companys cash and investments is available to pay claims and other obligations as they become due the companys investment portfolio is highly liquid with approximately 82 invested in cash cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities as of december 31 2012 if the sale of fixed maturity securities were to become necessary a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the cost and sales price of securities sold would be recognized

the company files a consolidated income tax return in the us and foreign tax returns in each of the countries in which it has overseas operations at december 31 2012  the company had a deferred gross tax asset of 447 million which primarily relates to loss and loss expense reserves and unearned premium reserves and a gross deferred tax liability of 507 million which primarily relates to deferred policy acquisition costs and unrealized investment gains the realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the companys ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods based on historical results and the prospects for future operations management anticipates that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient for the realization of this asset 

the company has not provided us deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of approximately 98 million of its nonus subsidiaries since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the nonus subsidiaries however in the future if such earnings were distributed to the company taxes of approximately 8 million assuming all tax credits are realized would be payable on such undistributed earnings and would be reflected in the tax provision for the year in which these earnings are no longer intended to be permanently reinvested in the foreign subsidiary 

reinsurance 

the company follows customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its exposures in exchange for paying reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies it writes reinsurance is purchased by the company principally to reduce its net liability on individual risks and to protect it against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage the company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and attempts to place its coverages only with substantial and financially sound carriers 

the following table presents the credit quality of amounts due from reinsurers as of december 31 2012  amounts due from reinsurers are net of reserves for uncollectible reinsurance of 2 million in the aggregate 

  

1 rating represents sp rating or if not rated by sp am best rating 

2 secured by letters of credit or other forms of collateral 

3 many states require licensed insurers that provide workers compensation insurance to participate in programs that provide workers compensation to employers that cannot procure coverage from an insurer on a voluntary basis insurers can fulfill this residual market obligation by participating in pools where results are shared by the participating companies the company acts as a servicing carrier for workers compensation pools in 20 states as a servicing carrier the company writes residual market business directly and then cedes 100 of this business to the respective pool as a servicing carrier the company receives fee income for its services the company does not retain underwriting risk and credit risk is limited as ceded balances are jointly shared by all the pool members 

as of january 1 2013 the company had in place a catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program that provides protection for net losses between 30 million and 155 million for the majority of primary business written by its us companies with additional coverage of between 5 million and 30 million depending on the region the company has separate catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance for business written through lloyds the catastrophe reinsurance agreements are subject to certain limits exclusions and reinstatement premiums

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk  the fair value of the company’s investments is subject to risks of fluctuations in credit quality and interest rates the company uses various models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage interest rate risk the company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate relationship between the average duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities ie policy claims and debt obligations the average duration for the fixed maturity portfolio was 34 and 36 years at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively in addition the fair value of the company’s international investments is subject to currency risk the company attempts to manage its currency risk by matching its foreign currency assets and liabilities where considered appropriate 

the following table outlines the groups of fixed maturity securities and their average duration at december 31 2012  



duration is a common measure of the price sensitivity of fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates the company determines the estimated change in fair value of the fixed maturity securities assuming parallel shifts in 

the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static the estimated fair value at specified levels at december 31 2012  would be as follows 



arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less the company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies including short sales 

additionally the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options selling call options or entering into swap contracts the companys merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among others historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made although the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

we discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience for nonproportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these discount rates range from 23  to 65  with a weighted average discount rate of 43  for proportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware of 23  the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance is 892 million  898 million  and 877 million  at december 31 2011  2010 and 2009 respectively 

to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations these claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which were subject to significant asbestos or environmental exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute pollution exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language 

our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 34 million  and 36 million  at december 31 2011  and 2010 respectively the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment 

expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 59 million  and 51 million  at december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims increased decreased by approximately 1 million  2 million  and 06 million  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 3 million  in each of 2011  2010  and 2009  the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years amounts in thousands 



 

 also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information regarding the decrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2011  as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” in the company’s us regulatory filings is as follows amounts in thousands 



1 for statutory purposes the company discounts its workers’ compensation reinsurance reserves at 23  as permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware in its gaap financial statements the company discounts excess workers’ compensation reserves at the riskfree rate and assumed workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate 

the following table presents the development of net reserves for 2001 through 2011 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 

the “cumulative redundancy deficiency” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 2001 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 2001 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2011 to 2300 and was settled for 2300 in 2011 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 2001 through 2011 



the following table presents the development of gross reserves for 2001 through 2011 



reinsurance 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “aexcellent” or better with at least 250 million in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

  

us regulation 

  

our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 

overview  our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums loss expenses and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

  

holding company statutes  in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems typically such statutes require that we periodically file 

information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase under alabama law which is applicable to us due to our ownership of american mining insurance company inc an alabama domiciled insurance company the acquisition of more than 5 of our capital stock is subject to prior regulatory approval 

the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” has recently adopted amendments to the model holding company law expanding upon the regulation of holding company systems when and if adopted by the various states these laws and regulations may have additional impact upon the companys operations 

  

risk based capital requirements  the naic utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the naic rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized rbc control level as of december 31 2011 

  

insurance regulatory information system  the naic also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the insurance regulatory information system “iris” on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 

  

guaranty funds  our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a states guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

additionally state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory propertyliability “shared market” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “fair” plans in addition some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 

  

excess and surplus lines  the regulation of our us subsidiaries excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 

  

dividends  we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

  

trade practices  state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices 

and the marketplace activities of insurers including provisions governing marketing and sales practices policyholder services claims management and complaint handling state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 

investment regulation investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind quality and concentration of investments in general these laws and regulations permit investments in federal state and municipal obligations corporate bonds preferred and common equity securities mortgage loans real estate and certain other investments subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications 

  

the terrorism risk insurance act the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended collectively “tria” established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism the program is effective through december 31 2014 tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism the most recent amendment to tria broadened the definition of certified acts to include domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will pay 85 of an insurers covered losses in excess of the insurers applicable deductible the insurers deductible is based on 20 percent of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2011 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2012 will be approximately 542 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 100 million tria limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

federal regulation   although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways in july 2010 president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which effects sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act created two new federal government bodies the federal insurance office the “fio” and the financial stability oversight council the “fsoc” which may impact the regulation of insurance although the fio is prohibited from directly regulating the business of insurance it has authority to represent the united states in international insurance matters and has limited powers to preempt certain types of state insurance laws the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure an insurer so designated by fsoc could be subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards based upon our current business model and balance sheet we do not believe that we will be designated by the fsoc as such an institution although the potential impacts of the doddfrank act on the u s insurance industry is not clear our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

in addition as a result of its direct majority ownership interest in peyton street independent financial services corporation a thrift holding company “peyton street” and indirect majority ownership stake in insurbanc a federal savings bank “insurbanc” w r berkley corporation is a “grandfathered savings and loan holding company” and under the doddfrank act is subject to the oversight of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” as a grandfathered savings and loan holding company w r berkley corporation may be subject to certain requirements and restrictions including those related to its shareholders management reporting capital adequacy dividends and distributions transactions with affiliates and compensation plans as peyton streets and insurbancs operations are currently immaterial to w r berkleys business and results of operations we are currently pursuing various alternatives in order to terminate w r berkley corporations status as a grandfathered savings and loan holding company 

international regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by the financial services authority the “fsa” the fsa oversees compliance with established periodic auditing and reporting requirements risk assessment reviews minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements dividend restrictions restrictions governing the appointment of key officers restrictions governing controlling ownership interests and various other 

requirements our lloyds syndicate is also regulated by the fsa and lloyds through lloyds we are licensed to write business throughout the world by virtue of lloyds international licenses in each such country we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country additionally fsa regulations also impact us as “controller” an fsa defined term of our ukregulated subsidiaries through the fsas approved persons regime certain employees and directors are subject to regulation by the fsa of their fitness and certain employees are individually registered at lloyds 

 the european unions executive body the european commission is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called “solvency ii” that would apply to our businesses across the european union beginning as soon as the first quarter of 2013 solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency under solvency ii it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiarys capital position is dependent on the parent company and the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to solvency ii while it is not certain how or if these actions will impact us we do not currently expect the capital management strategies for our us and international companies will be materially impacted 

our international underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in certain countries in continental europe south america australia southeast asia and canada generally our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements while each country imposes licensing solvency auditing and financial reporting requirements the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially key areas where country regulations may differ include i the type of financial reports to be filed ii a requirement to use local intermediaries iii the amount of reinsurance permissible iv the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates and v the type and frequency of regulatory examinations 

competition 

  

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with many insurance companies of various sizes as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as selfinsured retentions or captive programs transacting business in the united states and internationally we compete directly with a large number of these companies competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit as a result of increased competition since 2004 we have generally been experiencing both downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and conditions however in 2011 rates and terms in the united states and international markets were generally stable andor showed modest improvements although certain products continue to experience strong competition 

competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers over the last few years many of our specialty companies have reduced their writing substantially as standard carriers had increasingly competed for excess and surplus business although this trend moderated in 2011 

  

competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re additionally in recent years our reinsurance writings have reduced substantially as many ceding companies elected to retain more business and the business available has been more competitive 

  

our regional subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers additionally direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 

  

our international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which in some cases are related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

  

additionally competition from insurers and reinsurers based in bermuda and other tax advantaged jurisdictions 

continues to increase including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign based entities in the excess and surplus lines businesses 

  

employees 

  

as of february 16 2012 we employed 6642 individuals of this number our subsidiaries employed 6537 persons and the remaining 105 persons were employed at the parent company

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our businesses results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in addition to those described below our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

risks relating to our industry 

  

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business in recent years we have faced increased competition in our business as a result of new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share resulting in decreased premium rates and less favorable contract terms and conditions the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return may impact rate adequacy and recently the federal reserve has indicated its intention to keep interest rates at historic lows through late 2014 these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would 

have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which have reduced premium rates and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume 

  

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies some of which have implicit or explicit government support competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided including ease of doing business over the internet speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written 

  

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from bermuda or other tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive and pricing advantages 

  

over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business particularly in our reinsurance and specialty segments as increased supply has led to reduced prices and at times less favorable terms and conditions our specialty segment has also encountered competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share although policy rates and terms for these lines of business generally stabilized or showed modest improvements in 2011 we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and as a result could experience renewed pressure on pricing and policy terms and conditions 

  

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves 

  

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 93 billion as of december 31 2011 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

  

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on managements assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

  

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

  

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain   

as industry practices and legal judicial social and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include but are not limited to 

•   judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability 

 

•   medical developments that link health issues to particular causes resulting in liability claims 

•   claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies including cyber security related risks 

  and 

•   claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions 

in some instances these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies as a result the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued 

in addition the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue to remove limitations on recovery to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business 

the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes 

  

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results for example weatherrelated losses were 153 million in 2011 81 million in 2010 63 million in 2009 114 million in 2008 and 34 million in 2007 

  

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes tsunamis hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

conditions in the financial markets and the global economy have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if such conditions continue 

  

the significant volatility and uncertainty experienced in financial markets around the world during the past several years and the effect of the economic downturn have continued although the us and various foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets the ultimate effectiveness of such actions remains unclear therefore volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and the resulting negative economic impact may continue for some time 

  

while we monitor conditions in the financial markets we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our results of operations and financial condition depending on conditions in the financial markets we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in future periods and financial market volatility and uncertainty and an economic downturn could have a significant negative impact on third parties that we do business with including insureds and reinsurers 

  

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts 

  

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended “tria” for up to 85 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2011 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2012 is approximately 542 million tria is in effect through december 31 2014 unless extended or replaced by a similar program the coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

  

our earnings could be more volatile because of our significant level of retentions 

  

as compared to a number of our competitors we maintain significant retention levels in premiums written we purchase less reinsurance the process by which we transfer or cede part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company thereby retaining more risk as a result our earnings could be more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 

  

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered in the united states by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

• standards of solvency including riskbased capital measurements 

• restrictions on the nature quality and concentration of investments 

• requirements pertaining to certain methods of accounting 

• rate and form regulation pertaining to certain of our insurance businesses and 

 

state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters our international business is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations 

federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to the current conditions in the financial markets and the recent economic downturn may 

lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 

in july 2010 president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant nonbank financial companies including insurance companies be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve the doddfrank act also established a federal insurance office “fio” and authorized the federal preemption of certain state insurance laws fsoc and the fio are authorized to study monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market the potential impact of the doddfrank act on the us insurance business is not clear our business could be affected by changes whether as a result of the doddfrank act or otherwise to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

as a result of its direct majority ownership interest in peyton street independent financial services corporation a thrift holding company and indirect majority ownership stake in insurbanc a federal savings bank w r berkley corporation is a “grandfathered savings and loan holding company” and under the doddfrank act is subject to the oversight of the federal reserve as a grandfathered savings and loan holding company w r berkley corporation may be subject to certain requirements and restrictions including those related to its shareholders management reporting capital adequacy dividends and distributions transactions with affiliates and compensation plans 

although us state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in addition to the changes brought about by the doddfrank act congress has considered over the past years various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarran ferguson act and tax law changes we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution 

  

with respect to international measures solvency ii the eu directive concerning the capital adequacy risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers which was adopted by the european parliament in april 2009 may affect our insurance businesses implementation of solvency ii by eu member states which is anticipated at the beginning of 2013 may require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance in addition solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers additionally our capital requirements may be adversely affected if the eu commission finds that the insurance regimes of our thirdcountry domiciled companies are not “equivalent” to the requirements of solvency ii 

  

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may further restrict the conduct of our business 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses 

  

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2011 the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 1216 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk certain of these 

amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

we are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders independent agents and brokers   

in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business including credit risk relating to policyholders independent agents and brokers for example our policyholders independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds 

as credit risk is generally a function of the economy we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn while we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms our efforts may not be successful for example to reduce such credit risk we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us in cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged andor the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit 

we are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys investors our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poors or moodys our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

if conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so on terms acceptable to us 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america australia the asiapacific region scandinavia and canada expose us to increased investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our investments in nonusdenominated securities are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our chairman and ceo president and coo senior executive officers presidents of our operating units experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

if we experience difficulties with our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted   

our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe terrorist attack or industrial accident or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if our business continuity plans do not sufficiently address such a business interruption system failure or service denial our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed 

failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability  

our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks computer viruses hackers employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches in addition we routinely transmit and receive personal confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security while we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these thirdparty vendors and others with whom we do business we may be unable to put in place such secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and in addition these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive information being transferred our failure to protect sensitive personal and our proprietary information whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors could result in significant monetary and reputational damages these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data 

security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs as a result our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective   

  

our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting claim processing and investment activities many of which are highly complex these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies as well as legal and regulatory standards including those related to privacy anticorruption antibribery and global finance and insurance matters our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance that the control systems objectives will be met if our controls are not effective it could lead to financial loss unanticipated risk exposure including underwriting credit and investment risk or damage to our reputation 

risks relating to our investments 

  

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations 

  

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2011 our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 11 billion or 84 of our total investment portfolio as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 9 state and municipal securities 48 corporate securities 21 mortgagebacked securities 14 and foreign government and corporate bonds 8 

  

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations additionally given the historically low interest rate environment we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals 

  

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue the economic downturn has resulted in many states and municipalities operating under deficits or projected deficits the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuers ability to perform its obligations thereunder additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

  

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the significant volatility experienced in the financial markets economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we invest some of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity and real estate related assets which may decline in value 

  

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity and real estate related assets and have recently increased our investments in these asset classes 

as a result of the current historically low interest rate environment at december 31 2011 our investment in these assets was approximately 2 billion or 16 of our investment portfolio we reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the value of these assets of approximately 400000 in 2011 9 million in 2010 and 63 million in 2009 and losses from investment funds of 6 million in 2010 and 164 million in 2009 

  

merger and arbitrage trading securities were 397 million or 3 of our investment portfolio at december 31 2011 merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

  

investments in real estate investment funds and limited partnerships and loans receivable were 921 million or 6 of our investment portfolio at december 31 2011 the values of our real estate related investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and real estate valuations in particular these investments have been subject to significant volatility as a result of the current conditions in the financial markets in addition our investments in real estate related assets are less liquid than our other investments 

  

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

  

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts 

  

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries as well as regulatory restrictions during 2012 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 417 million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations pay dividends or repurchase shares 

laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable and may restrict a stockholders ability to purchase our common stock 

generally united states insurance holding   company laws require that before a person can acquire control of an insurance company prior written approval   must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is   domiciled pursuant to applicable laws and regulations “control” over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person   directly or indirectly owns controls holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 or more of   the voting securities of that insurer 5 for alabama domiciled insurers such as us due to our ownership of american mining indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock thus   the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance operating units are domiciled are likely to   apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common   stock some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to   make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates on the one hand and the target   insurer and its affiliates on the other hand have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state additionally many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements 

while these provisions may not require acquisition approval they can lead to the imposition of conditions on an   acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation   these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control   of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might   consider to be desirable 

certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

  

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may 

hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 

  

these provisions include 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

w r berkley corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the united states and operates in five business segments specialty regional alternative markets reinsurance and international our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches it also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics while providing our business units with certain operating autonomy our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital investment and reinsurance management and actuarial financial and corporate legal staff support the company’s primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments 

an important part of our strategy is to form new operating units to capitalize on various business opportunities with 21 of our 45 units formed since 2006 these newer units are focused on important parts of the economy in the us including healthcare energy and agriculture and on growing international markets including norway australia the asiapacific region and south america as a result our international operations have become an increasingly important part of our business 

the profitability of the company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time a property casualty insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural and other disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses general insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity ie the level of policyholders’ surplus employed in the industry and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital 

beginning in 2005 the property casualty insurance market became more competitive and insurance rates decreased across most business lines increased competition and the impact of the economic downturn also put pressure on policy terms and conditions while prices began to increase in 2011 loss costs are also increasing and current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its return objectives recently there have been increased signs of a hardening market and with its investments in new businesses the company believes it is wellpositioned to take advantage of new opportunities price changes are reflected in the company’s results over time as premiums are earned 

the company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income the company’s invested assets which are derived from its own capital and cash flow from its insurance business are invested principally in fixed maturity securities the return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates which are at historically low levels as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities the company also invests in equity securities merger arbitrage private equity investments investment funds and real estate 

critical accounting estimates 

the following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses assumed premiums and otherthantemporary impairments of investments management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments 

reserves for losses and loss expenses    to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims 

including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses these factors include among other things historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves have increased under the current financial market conditions it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our operations in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations the company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each operating unit these methods include paid loss development incurred loss development paid and incurred bornhuetterferguson methods and frequency and severity methods in circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others that method is used to set the point estimate for example the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data for new lines of business where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods the actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered industry loss experience is used to supplement the company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the company’s own data is limited the actuarial data is analyzed by line of business coverage and accident or policy year as appropriate for each operating unit 

the establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses these qualitative considerations include among others the impact of reunderwriting initiatives changes in the mix of business changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits the expansion of coverage exclusions whether or not defense costs are within policy limits and changes in deductibles and attachment points 

the key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is written before any actual claims experience has emerged this expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each operating unit expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the longtail lines such as excess casualty and claims with a high medical component such as workers’ compensation reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses and are derived from the company’s own experience and industry data the paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns management believes the estimates 

and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred however different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates 

loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves including expected loss ratios rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits retentions rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 

another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses less ibnr is required for lines with short reporting lags as a result loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates for lines with short reporting lags which include commercial automobile primary workers’ compensation other liability claimsmade and property business the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date for lines of business with long reporting lags which include other liability occurrence products liability excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider historically the company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags 

the key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect historical changes current trends and other factors observed if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate the following table reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity relative to our assumptions on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2011 dollars in thousands 



our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 82 billion as of december 31 2011  relate to multiple accident years therefore the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above 

approximately 14 billion or 19 of the company’s net loss reserves as of december 31 2011  relate to assumed reinsurance business there is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of assumed loss reserves because those estimates are based in part upon information received from ceding companies if information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct the company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate furthermore due to delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is extended management considers the impact of delayed reporting in its selection of assumed loss development factors 

information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business this information which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies the company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the company the information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks 

following is a summary of the company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of december 31 

2011  and december 31 2010  

  



following is a summary of the company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses by major line of business as of december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  

  



reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business are net of an aggregate net discount of 892 million and 898 million as of december 31 2011  and december 31 2010 respectively 

the following table presents development in our estimate of claims occurring in prior years   



  

1 represents portion of reserve development offset by additional or return premiums on retrospectively rated insurance policies and reinsurance agreements 

for the year ended december 31 2011  estimates for claims occurring in prior years decreased by 182 million the favorable reserve development in 2011 was primarily attributable to accident years 2007 through 2009 the changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends 

specialty   the majority of the favorable reserve development for the specialty segment during 2011 and 2010 was associated with excess and surplus “es” casualty business es insurers are free from rate and form regulation and generally charge higher rates for business than those that are charged in the “standard” market beginning in 2002 the es business began to experience improved claim frequency ie a lower number of reported claims per unit of exposure one reason for the lower number of claims was the company’s introduction of more restrictive policy language which included additional exclusions that eliminated claims that would have previously been covered particularly for the company’s building contractor business in addition as standard carriers tightened their underwriting criteria the company benefited from an influx of accounts from the standard market to the es market during these years the more restrictive policy language and the influx of standard market business resulted in an improved risk profile within the es business and a reduction in loss costs that was not expected at the time loss reserves were initially established in addition loss severity trends for es casualty business have been lower than we had initially expected for the 2005 to 2009 period we began to recognize these trends in 2007 and have continued to reduce our estimates of ultimate claim costs since then as the magnitude of the frequency trends has become more evident the favorable reserve development in 2011 was primarily attributable to accident years 2007 through 2009 

regional   the favorable reserve development for the regional segment during 2011 was primarily related to the general liability portion of commercial multiperil business and to commercial automobile liability business the favorable reserve development resulted mainly from lower loss emergence on known case reserves relative to historical levels the favorable reserve development was primarily attributable to accident years 2007 through 2009 

alternative markets   the favorable reserve development for the alternative markets segment during 2011 was related to a decrease in prior year reserves for primary workers’ compensation business and to a lesser extent for medical excess business partially offset by an increase in prior year reserves for excess workers’ compensation business the majority of favorable reserve development for primary workers’ compensation was related to california business where the impact of legislative reforms continues to be reflected in improved loss trends the increase in loss reserves for excess workers’ compensation business was related primarily to increased medical and pharmaceutical costs associated with certain longterm disability claims 

  reinsurance   the favorable development for the reinsurance segment during 2011 was related to umbrella and professional liability treaty business facultative business and to business written through lloyd’s of london the favorable development for the segment was spread across underwriting years 2005 through 2010 and resulted from lower than expected reported losses 

international   the favorable reserve development for the international segment during 2011 was primarily related to property business written in 2010 by our lloyds syndicate and asiapacific reinsurance business 

loss reserve discount   the company discounts its liabilities for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience for nonproportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve for proportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware of 23 as of december 31 2011  the aggregate blended discount rates ranged from 23 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 43 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance was 892 million and 898 million as of december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  respectively 

assumed reinsurance premiums  the company estimates the amount of assumed reinsurance premiums that it will receive under treaty reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contracts these premium estimates are revised as the actual amount of assumed premiums is reported to the company by the ceding companies as estimates of assumed premiums are made or revised the related amount of earned premiums commissions and incurred losses associated with those premiums are recorded estimated assumed premiums receivable were approximately 64 million and 58 million at december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  respectively the assumed premium estimates are based upon terms set forth in reinsurance agreements information received from ceding companies during the underwriting and negotiation of agreements reports received from ceding companies and discussions and correspondence with reinsurance intermediaries the company also considers its own view of market conditions economic trends and experience with similar lines of business these premium estimates represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate amount of premiums to be received under its assumed reinsurance agreements 

otherthantemporary impairments otti of investments  the cost of securities is adjusted where appropriate to include a provision for decline in value which is considered to be otherthantemporary an otherthantemporary decline is considered to occur in investments where there has been a sustained reduction in fair value and where the company does not expect the fair value to recover prior to the time of sale or maturity since equity securities do not have a contractual cash flow or maturity the company considers whether the price of an equity security is expected to recover within a reasonable period of time 

the company classifies its fixed maturity securities and preferred stocks by credit rating primarily based on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies for purposes of classifying securities with different ratings the company uses the lower rating if two ratings were assigned and the middle rating if three ratings were assigned unless the company’s own analysis indicates that the lower rating is more appropriate securities that are not rated by a rating agency are evaluated and classified by the company on a casebycase basis 

fixed maturity securities  – for securities that we intend to sell or more likely than not would be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be otti the amount of otti is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value at the balance sheet date for securities that we do not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an otti if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security ie the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 

the portion of the decline in value considered to be a credit loss ie the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security is recognized in earnings the portion of the decline in value not considered to be a credit loss ie the difference in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value of the security is recognized in other comprehensive income 

impairment assessments for structured securities including mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities collateralized debt obligations and corporate debt are generally evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios that may involve subjective judgments and estimates by management modeling these securities involves various factors such as projected default rates the nature and realizable value of the collateral if any the ability of the issuer to make scheduled payments historical performance and other relevant economic and performance factors if an otti determination is made a discounted cash flow analysis is used to ascertain the amount of the credit impairment 

the following table provides a summary of all fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position as of december 31 2011  

  



a summary of the company’s noninvestment grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2011  is presented in the table below 

  



 

1 this investment is a residential mortgagebacked security that was evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios the security has met its contractual obligations and the company expects that it will continue to meet those contractual payment obligations as they become due based on this evaluation the company does not consider the investment to be otti 

the company has evaluated its fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to temporary market and sectorrelated factors rather than to issuerspecific factors none of these securities are delinquent or in default under financial covenants based on its assessment of these issuers the company expects them to continue to meet their contractual payment obligations as they become due and does not consider any of these securities to be otti 

preferred stocks  – at december 31 2011  there were six  preferred stocks in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of 69 million  and a gross unrealized loss of 15 million  four of the six securities are investmentgrade none of these securities are delinquent or in default management believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to market and sector related factors and does not consider these to be otti two  of those preferred stocks with an aggregate fair value of 9 million  and a gross unrealized loss of 5 million  are rated noninvestment grade one of these two securities representing most of the gross unrealized loss has recently reflected improved fundamentals the company does not consider this security to be otti 

common stocks  – at december 31 2011  the company owned four  common stocks in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of 47 million  and an aggregate unrealized loss of 3 million  the company does not consider these common stocks to be otti 

loans receivable  – the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable including current market conditions for each loan and the ability to collect principal and interest for loans where the company determines it is probable that the contractual terms will not be met an analysis is performed and a valuation reserve is established if necessary with a charge to earnings loans receivable are reported net of a valuation reserve of 20 million  at december 31 2011 and 2010 

the company monitors the performance of its loans receivable and assesses the ability of the borrower to pay principal and interest based upon loan structure underlying property values cash flow and related financial and operating performance of the property and market conditions loans receivable with a potential for default are further assessed using discounted cash 

flow analysis and comparable cost and sales methodologies if appropriate 

fair value measurements    the company’s fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale and its trading account securities are carried at fair value fair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date” the company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available the fair value of the vast majority of the company’s portfolio is based on observable data other than quoted prices and accordingly is classified as level 2 

in classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy the company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable the company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information the company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers the uninterrupted availability of such inputs the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time if the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable the security is categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers and reference data quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions for publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable the company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data for securities traded only in private negotiations the company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer financial data projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information 

the following is a summary of pricing sources for the companys fixed maturity securities available for sale as of december 31 2011  

  



independent pricing services   the vast majority of the company’s fixed maturity securities available for sale were priced by independent pricing services generally one us pricing service plus additional pricing services with respect to a limited number of foreign securities held by the company the prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets eg broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities the determination of whether markets are active or inactive is based upon the volume and level of activity for a particular asset class the company reviews the prices provided by pricing services for reasonableness based upon current trading levels for similar securities if the prices appear unusual to the company they are reexamined and the value is either confirmed or revised in addition the company periodically performs independent price tests of a sample of securities to ensure proper valuation and to verify our understanding of how securities are priced as of december 31 2011  the company did not make any adjustments to the prices provided by the pricing services based upon the company’s review of the methodologies used by the independent pricing services these securities were classified as level 2 

syndicate manager  – the company has a 15 participation in a lloyd’s syndicate and the company’s share of the securities owned by the syndicate is priced by the syndicate’s manager the majority of the securities are liquid short duration 

fixed maturity securities the company reviews the syndicate manager’s pricing methodology and audited financial statements and holds discussions with the syndicate manager as necessary to confirm its understanding and agreement with security prices based upon the company’s review of the methodologies used by the syndicate manager these securities were classified as level 2 

observable data  – if independent pricing is not available the company prices the securities directly prices are based on observable market data where available including current trading levels for similar securities and nonbinding quotations from brokers the company generally requests two or more quotes if more than one quote is received the company sets a price within the range of quotes received based on its assessment of the credibility of the quote and its own evaluation of the security the company generally does not adjust quotes obtained from brokers since these securities were priced based on observable data they were classified as level 2 

cash flow model  – if the above methodologies are not available the company prices securities using a discounted cash flow model based upon assumptions as to prevailing credit spreads interest rates and interest rate volatility time to maturity and subordination levels discount rates are adjusted to reflect illiquidity where appropriate these securities were classified as level 3

following is a summary of gross and net premiums written premiums earned loss ratios losses and loss expenses incurred expressed as a percentage of premiums earned expense ratios underwriting expenses expressed as a percentage of premiums earned and gaap combined ratios sum of loss ratio and expense ratio for each of our business segments for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010 the gaap combined ratio represents a measure of underwriting profitability excluding investment income a gaap combined ratio in excess of 100 indicates an underwriting loss a number below 100 indicates an underwriting profit 

  



net income to common stockholders  the following table presents the company’s net income to common stockholders and net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 amounts in thousands except per share data   



the company reported net income of 395 million in 2011 compared to 449 million in 2010 the decrease in net income was primarily due to a decline in underwriting income partially offset by an increase in net investment gains the decline in underwriting income was attributable to an increase in catastrophe losses of 72 million and a decrease in favorable prior year reserve development of 52 million the number of weighted average diluted shares decreased as a result of the company’s repurchases of its common stock in 2011 and 2010 

premiums  gross premiums written were 5077 million in 2011 an increase of 15 from 4416 million in 2010 the increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to growth in our specialty and international business segments as a result of expansion into new geographic and product markets approximately 80 of policies expiring in 2011 were renewed compared with a 77 renewal retention rate for policies expiring in 2010 the average rate ie average premium adjusted for change in exposures for policies that renewed in 2011 increased by approximately 23 audit premiums were 53 million in 2011 compared with 18 million in 2010 

beginning in 2005 the property casualty insurance market became more competitive and insurance rates decreased across most business lines while prices increased in 2011 overall loss costs are also generally increasing and current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its return objectives a summary of gross premiums written in 2011 compared with 2010 by line of business within each business segment follows 

 net premiums written were 4357 million in 2011 an increase of 13 from 3851 million in 2010 ceded reinsurance premiums as a percentage of gross written premiums increased to 14 in 2011 from 13 in 2010 the increase in the percentage of business ceded was due to the increase in premiums written by new companies which cede a higher portion of their gross premiums and to growth in premiums written by assigned risk plans which cede 100 of their gross premiums 

premiums earned increased 9 to 4161 million in 2011 from 3836 million in 2010 insurance premiums including the impact of rate changes are generally earned evenly over the policy term premiums earned in 2011 are related to business written during both 2011 and 2010 

net investment income  following is a summary of net investment income for 2011 and 2010 

  



net investment income decreased 1 to 526 million in 2011 from 531 million in 2010 the decrease in investment income was due to a decrease in income from arbitrage trading activities partially offset by income from investment funds which are reported on a one quarter lag average invested assets at cost including cash and cash equivalents were 136 billion in 2011 and 134 billion in 2010 

insurance service fees  the company is a servicing carrier of workers compensation assigned risk plans for 20 states and provides insurance program management services to selfinsureds captives governmental entities risk retention groups and insurance companies service fees were 93 million in 2011 up from 85 million in 2010 primarily as a result of an increase in fees from assigned risk plans 

net investment gains  the company buys and sells securities on a regular basis in order to maximize its total return on investments decisions to sell securities are based on management’s view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as management’s expectations regarding interest rates credit spreads currency values and general economic conditions net realized gains on investment sales were 126 million in 2011 compared with 66 million in 2010 

otherthantemporary impairments  the cost of securities is adjusted where appropriate to include a provision for decline in value which is considered to be otherthantemporary otherthantemporary impairments were 04 million in 2011 compared with 92 million in 2010 

revenues from whollyowned investees  these revenues were derived from aviationrelated businesses that provide services to the general aviation market including fuel and line service aircraft sales and maintenance avionics and engineering services and parts fabrication revenues from whollyowned investees increased to 249 million in 2011 from 214 million in 2010 primarily as a result of higher aircraft sales 

losses and loss expenses  losses and loss expenses increased to 2658 million in 2011 from 2310 million in 2010 the consolidated loss ratio of 639 in 2011 was 37 points higher than the loss ratio of 602 in 2010 catastrophe losses net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums were 153 million in 2011 compared with 81 million in 2010 an increase of 16 loss ratio points catastrophe losses in 2011 included losses from severe wind and hail storms in the united states an earthquake in japan and floods in thailand favorable prior year reserve development was 182 million in 2011 compared with 234 million in 2010 a difference of 17 loss ratio points the loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development increased 04 points to 646 in 2011 from 642 in 2010 a summary of loss ratios in 2011 compared with 2010 by business segment follows 

 44 

losses were 85 million in 2011 compared with 73 million in 2010 an increase of 11 loss ratio points favorable prior year reserve development was 40 million in 2011 compared with 84 million in 2010 a difference of 41 loss ratio points the loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development increased 21 points to 638 in 2011 from 617 in 2010 due to earned pricing and loss cost trends 

 other operating costs and expenses  following is a summary of other operating costs and expenses for 2011 and 2010 

  



underwriting expenses are comprised of commissions paid to agents and brokers premium taxes and other assessments and internal underwriting costs the expense ratio underwriting expenses expressed as a percentage of premiums earned was 344 in 2011 compared with 343 in 2010 due to increases in internal underwriting costs largely offset by an increase in earned premiums 

service expenses which represent the costs associated with the feebased businesses increased 4 to 75 million the increase was due to an increase in general and administrative expenses 

net foreign currency gains and losses result from transactions denominated in a currency other than the operating unit’s functional currency 

other costs and expenses which represent general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to business segments increased to 115 million in 2011 from 107 million in 2010 due to an increase in general and administrative expenses 

expenses from whollyowned investees  these expenses represent costs associated with aviationrelated businesses that include cost of goods sold related to aircraft and other sales labor and equipment costs related to repairs and other services and general and administrative expenses expenses from whollyowned investees were 245 million in 2011 compared to 208 million in 2010 due to higher cost of aircraft sold as a result of higher sales volume 

interest expense  interest expense was 113 million in 2011 compared with 107 million in 2010 due to the issuance of 300 million of 5375 senior notes in september 2010 partially offset by repayment of 150 million 5125 senior notes in september 2010 

income taxes  the effective income tax rate was 24 in 2011 as compared to 25 in 2010 the effective income tax rate differs from the federal income tax rate of 35 primarily because of taxexempt investment income and utilization of foreign tax credits including a reduction of the valuation allowance tax exempt investment income comprised a higher portion of the 2011 pretax income and as such had a higher impact on the effective tax rate for 2011 compared with 2010

fixed maturity securities  the company’s investment policy with respect to fixed maturity securities is generally to purchase instruments with the expectation of holding them to their maturity however management of the available for sale portfolio is considered necessary to maintain an approximate matching of assets and liabilities as well as to adjust the portfolio as a result of changes in financial market conditions and tax considerations 

the company’s philosophy related to holding or selling fixed maturity securities is based on its objective of maximizing total return the key factors that management considers in its investment decisions as to whether to hold or sell fixed maturity securities are its view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as its expectations regarding interest rates credit spreads and currency values in a period in which management expects interest rates to rise the company may sell longer duration securities in order to mitigate the impact of an interest rate rise on the fair value of the portfolio similarly in a period in which management expects credit spreads to widen the company may sell lower quality securities and in a period in which management expects certain foreign currencies to decline in value the company may sell securities denominated in those foreign currencies the sale of fixed maturity securities in order to achieve the objective of maximizing total return may result in realized gains however there is no reason to expect these gains to continue in future periods

the following table outlines the groups of fixed maturity securities and their average duration at december 31 2011  



duration is a common measure of the price sensitivity of fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates the company determines the estimated change in fair value of the fixed maturity securities assuming parallel shifts in 

the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static the estimated fair value at specified levels at december 31 2011  would be as follows dollars in thousands 



arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less the company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies including short sales 

additionally the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options selling call options or entering into swap contracts the companys merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 

 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant 

periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in addition to the economic value of losses these factors include historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made although the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

 

we discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience for nonproportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these discount rates range from 25 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 44 for proportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware of 25 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance is 898193000 877305000 and 846748000 at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in the aggregate discount from 2009 to 2010 and from 2008 to 2009 resulted from the increase in workers’ compensation gross reserves 

 

to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations these claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries 

generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which are subject to significant asbestos or environmental exposures 

 

our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 35543000 and 36525000 at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 51214000 and 53986000 at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims increased decreased by approximately 1755000 614000 and 440000 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 2737000 2508000 and 2384000 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information regarding the decrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2010 as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” in the company’s us regulatory filings is as follows amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

the following table presents the development of net reserves for 2000 through 2010 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 

 

the “cumulative redundancy deficiency” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 2000 reserves have developed a 1120 million deficiency over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 2000 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 2000 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2010 to 2300 and was settled for 2300 in 2010 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 2000 through 2010

reinsurance 

 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “aexcellent” or better with at least 250 million in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

 

us regulation 

 

our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business and the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with such regulations our insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

 

in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase under alabama law which is applicable to us due to our ownership of american mining insurance company inc an alabama domiciled insurance company the acquisition of more than 5 of our capital stock is subject to prior regulatory approval further state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect their solvency see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

 

the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized rbc control level as of december 31 2010 

 

the naic also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the insurance regulatory information system “iris” on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 

 

the naic also has recently adopted amendments to the model holding company law expanding upon the regulation of holding company systems when and if adopted by the various states these laws and regulations may have additional impact upon the company’s operations 

 

our insurance company subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory propertyliability “shared market” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “fair” plans in addition some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 

 

the regulation of our us subsidiaries’ excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 

 

we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled 

 

state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers including provisions governing marketing and sales practices policyholder services claims management and complaint handling state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 

 

the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 became effective november 26 2002 was amended on december 22 2005 by the terrorism risk insurance extension act of 2005 and further amended effective december 26 2007 by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 collectively “tria” tria established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism the program is effective through december 31 2014 tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners’ multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism the most recent amendment to tria broadened the definition of certified acts to include domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will pay 85 of an insurer’s covered losses in excess of the insurer’s applicable deductible the insurer’s deductible is based on 20 percent of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2010 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2011 will be approximately 503 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 100 million tria limits the federal government’s share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

 

competition 

 

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with over 2000 insurance companies transacting business in the united states we compete directly with a large number of these companies our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices such practices are based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit competition in our industry generally changes with profitability and has increased since 2004 as a result of increased competition we have experienced both downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and conditions 

competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers standard carriers have increasingly competed for excess and surplus business and as a result many of our specialty companies have reduced their writing substantially 

 

competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re additionally our reinsurance writings have reduced substantially since many ceding companies have elected to retain more business and the limited business available has become more competitive 

 

the regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 

 

the international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which may be related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

 

competition from insurers and reinsurers based in bermuda and other tax advantaged jurisdictions has increased over the last several years including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign based entities especially as to excess and surplus lines business 

 

employees 

 

as of february 16 2011 we employed 6253 individuals of this number our subsidiaries employed 6154 persons and the remaining 99 persons were employed at the parent company

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our businesses results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

 

risks relating to our industry 

 

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business including as a result of an increased flow of capital into the insurance and reinsurance industry with both new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share this has resulted in decreased premium rates and at times less favorable contract terms and conditions the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return may impact rate adequacy these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves 

 

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 9 billion as of december 31 2010 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility such as under the current financial market conditions it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

 

we decreased our estimates for claims occurring in prior years by 253 million in 2010 234 million in 2009 196 million in 2008 and 106 million in 2007 and increased our estimates by 27 million in 2006 we along with the property casualty insurance industry in general have experienced higher than expected losses for certain types of business written from 1999 to 2002 although our reserves reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims we cannot assure you that our claim estimates will not need to be increased in the future 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes 

 

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results in addition through our participation in certain lloyd’s syndicates we have additional exposure to catastrophic losses for example weatherrelated losses were 81 million in 2010 63 million in 2009 114 million in 2008 34 million in 2007 and 39 million in 2006 

 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which have reduced premium rates and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume 

 

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies some of which have implicit or explicit government support competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided including ease of doing business over the internet speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written 

 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from bermuda or other tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive and pricing advantages 

 

over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business particularly in our reinsurance and specialty segments as increased supply has led to reduced prices and at times less favorable terms and conditions our specialty segment increasingly encounters competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and may continue to experience reduced pricing and weaker terms and conditions 

 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on acceptable terms and conditions if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates and on acceptable terms and conditions our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

conditions in the financial markets and the effect of the economic downturn have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if such conditions continue 

 

the significant volatility and uncertainty experienced in financial markets around the world during the past several years and the effect of the economic downturn have continued although the us and various foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets the ultimate effectiveness of such actions remains unclear therefore volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and the resulting negative economic impact may continue for some time 

 

while we monitor conditions in the financial markets we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our results of operations and financial condition depending on conditions in the financial markets we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in future periods and financial market volatility and uncertainty and an economic downturn could have a significant negative impact on third parties that we do business with including insureds and reinsurers 

 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts 

 

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended on december 22 2005 and further amended on december 26 2007 “tria” for up to 85 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2010 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2011 is approximately 503 million tria is in effect through december 31 2014 unless extended or replaced by a similar program the coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

 

our earnings could be more volatile because of our significant level of retentions 

 

as compared to a number of our competitors we maintain significant retention levels in premiums written we purchase less reinsurance the process by which we transfer or cede part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company thereby retaining more risk as a result our earnings could be more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 

 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

 

  

state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to the current conditions in the financial markets and the ongoing economic downturn may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 

on july 21 2010 president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which effects sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states the doddfrank act establishes the financial services oversight council “fsoc” which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant nonbank financial companies including insurance companies be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve the doddfrank act also establishes a federal insurance office “fio” and authorizes the federal preemption of certain state insurance laws fsoc and the fio are authorized to study monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market the potential impact of the doddfrank act on the us insurance business is not clear however our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant nonbank financial companies 

 

although us state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in addition to the changes brought about by the doddfrank act congress has considered over the past years various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarran ferguson act and tax law changes we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution also foreign governments regulate our international operations 

 

with respect to international measures an eu directive concerning the capital adequacy risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers “solvency ii” which was adopted by the european parliament in april 2009 may affect our insurance businesses adoption by eu member states is anticipated at the end of 2012 implementation of solvency ii may require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance in addition solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency our capital requirements may be adversely affected if the eu commission finds that the insurance regimes of our thirdcountry domiciled companies are not equivalent to the requirements of solvency ii 

 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities restrict the conduct of our business 

 

in certain of our insurance businesses the rates we charge our policyholders are subject to regulatory approval certain lines of business are subject to a greater degree of regulatory scrutiny than others for example the workers’ compensation business is highly regulated for 2010 approximately 165 of our net premiums written represented primary workers’ compensation business over the past several years rates for primary workers’ compensation business written in the state of california have declined significantly as a result of workers’ compensation reform of our net premiums written during 2010 approximately 16 represented primary workers’ compensation business written in the state of california 

 

risks relating to our business 

 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses 

 

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future 

ability to pay claims as of december 31 2010 the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 1070 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

 

we are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s investors our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain those ratings 

 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poor’s or moody’s our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the economic downturn we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

 

if the current conditions in the financial markets and the economic downturn continue we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and new ventures 

 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america australia southeast asia and canada expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

our investments in nonusdenominated securities are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 

 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our chairman and ceo coo senior executive officers presidents of our operating units experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

 

risks relating to our investments 

 

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations 

 

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2010 our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 11 billion or 86 of our total investment portfolio as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 12 state and municipal securities 50 corporate securities 21 mortgagebacked securities 13 and foreign government bonds 4 

 

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower in addition some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations 

 

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue the economic downturn has resulted in many states and municipalities operating under deficits or projected deficits the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuer’s ability to perform its obligations thereunder additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

 

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the significant volatility experienced in the financial markets economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we invest some of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity and real estate related assets which may decline in value 

 

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity and real estate related assets at december 31 2010 our investment in these assets was approximately 18 billion or 14 of our investment portfolio we reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the value of these assets of approximately 9 million in 2010 63 million in 2009 and 427 million in 2008 and losses from investment funds of 8 million in 2010 174 million in 2009 and 4 million in 2008 

 

merger and arbitrage trading securities were 420 million or 3 of our investment portfolio at december 31 2010 merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

 

investments in publicly traded real estate investment trusts real estate investment funds and limited partnerships and loans receivable were 675 million or 5 of our investment portfolio at december 31 2010 the values of our real estate related investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy in general and real estate valuations in particular these investments have been subject to significant volatility as a result of the current conditions in the financial markets in addition our investments in real estate related assets are less liquid than our other investments 

 

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

 

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts 

 

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries as well as regulatory restrictions during 2011 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 490 million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations or pay dividends 

 

we are subject to certain provisions that may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers which may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover and make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 

 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant 

periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in addition to the economic value of losses these factors include historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves have increased under the current financial market conditions it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot assure that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

 

we discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience for nonproportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these discount rates range from 27 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 44 for proportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware of 27 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance is 877305000 846748000 and 787988000 at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in the aggregate discount from 2008 to 2009 and from 2007 to 2008 resulted from the increase in workers’ compensation gross reserves 

 

to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations these claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which are subject to significant environmental exposures 

our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 36525000 and 39646000 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 53986000 and 56957000 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 614000 440000 and 7029000 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 2508000 2384000 and 2912000 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential affect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information regarding the decrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2009 as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” is as follows amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

the following table presents the development of net reserves for 1999 through 2009 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 

 

the “cumulative redundancy deficiency” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1999 reserves have developed a 688 million deficiency over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 1999 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 1999 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2009 to 2300 and was settled for 2300 in 2008 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 1999 through 2009

reinsurance 

 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “aexcellent” or better with at least 250 million in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

 

our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business and the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with such regulations our insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

 

in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase under alabama law which is applicable to us due to our ownership of american mining insurance company inc an alabama domiciled insurance company the acquisition of more than 5 of our capital stock is subject to prior regulatory approval further state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect their solvency see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

 

various state and federal organizations including congressional committees and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have been conducting reviews into various aspects of the insurance business the insurance industry has been the subject of scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices state and federal regulators have conducted proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products and alleged unsuitable sales practices no assurance can be given that future legislative or regulatory changes resulting from such activities will not adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries 

 

the naic utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized rbc control level as of december 31 2009 

 

the grammleachbliley act or financial services modernization act of 1999 the “act” was enacted in 1999 and significantly affects the financial services industry including insurance companies banks and securities firms the act modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding companies which as regulated by the act can maintain crossholdings in insurance companies banks and securities firms to an extent not previously allowed the act also permits or facilitates certain types of combinations or affiliations for financial holding companies the act establishes a functional regulatory scheme under which state insurance departments will maintain primary regulation over insurance activities subject to provisions for certain federal preemptions 

 

our insurance company subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums the naic 

model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

 

we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled 

 

the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 became effective november 26 2002 was amended on december 22 2005 by the terrorism risk insurance extension act of 2005 and further amended effective december 26 2007 by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 collectively “tria” tria established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism the program is effective through december 31 2014 tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners’ multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism the most recent amendment to tria broadened the definition of certified acts to include domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will pay 85 of an insurer’s covered losses in excess of the insurer’s applicable deductible the insurer’s deductible is based on 20 percent of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2009 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2010 will be approximately 512 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 100 million tria limits the federal government’s share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

 

competition 

 

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with over 2000 insurance companies transacting business in the united states we compete directly with a large number of these companies our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices such practices are based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit competition in our industry generally changes with profitability and has increased since 2004 as a result of increased competition we have experienced both downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and conditions 

 

competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers standard carriers have increasingly competed for excess and surplus business 

 

competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re 

 

the regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 

 

the international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which may be related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

competition from insurers based in bermuda and other tax advantaged jurisdictions has increased over the last several years including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign based entities especially as to excess and surplus lines business 

 

employees 

 

as of february 16 2010 we employed 6072 individuals of this number our subsidiaries employed 5978 persons and the remaining 94 persons were employed at the parent company

we maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 

 

seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 

 

we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our businesses results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

 

risks relating to our industry 

 

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business including as a result of an increased flow of capital into the insurance and reinsurance industry with both new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share this has resulted in decreased premium rates and at times less favorable contract terms and conditions the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return may impact rate adequacy these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves 

 

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 9 billion as of december 31 2009 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility such as under the current financial market conditions it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

 

we decreased our estimates for claims occurring in prior years by 234 million in 2009 196 million in 2008 and 106 million in 2007 and increased our estimates by 27 million in 2006 and 187 million in 2005 we along with the property casualty insurance industry in general have experienced higher than expected losses for certain types of business written from 1999 to 2002 although our reserves reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims we cannot assure you that our claim estimates will not need to be increased in the future 

 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes 

 

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results in addition through our participation in certain lloyd’s syndicates we have additional exposure to catastrophic losses for example weatherrelated losses were 63 million in 2009 114 million in 2008 34 million in 2007 39 million in 2006 and 99 million in 2005 

 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations or physical impacts of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or 

multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which have reduced premium rates and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume 

 

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies some of which have implicit or explicit government support competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written 

 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include swiss re munich re berkshire hathaway transatlantic reinsurance and partner re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from bermuda or other tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive and pricing advantages 

 

over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business particularly in our reinsurance segment as increased supply has led to reduced prices our specialty segment increasingly encounters competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and may continue to experience reduced pricing and weaker terms and conditions 

 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on acceptable terms and conditions if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

current conditions in the financial markets and the ongoing economic downturn have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if such conditions continue 

 

the significant volatility and uncertainty experienced in financial markets around the world during the past several years and the ongoing economic downturn have continued although the us and various foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets it is unclear whether those actions will be effective therefore volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and the resulting negative economic impact may continue for some time 

 

while we monitor conditions in the financial markets we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our results of operations and financial condition depending on conditions in the financial markets we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in future periods and financial market volatility and uncertainty and an economic downturn could have a significant negative impact on third parties that we do business with including insureds and reinsurers 

 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts 

 

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended on december 22 2005 and further amended on december 26 2007 “tria” for up to 85 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2009 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2010 is approximately 512 million tria is in effect through 

december 31 2014 unless extended or replaced by a similar program the coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

 

our earnings could be more volatile because of our significant level of retentions 

 

as compared to a number of our competitors we maintain significant retention levels in premiums written we purchase less reinsurance the process by which we transfer or cede part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company thereby retaining more risk as a result our earnings could be more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 

 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

 

  

state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to the current conditions in the financial markets and the ongoing economic downturn may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution also foreign governments regulate our international operations 

 

the insurance industry has been the subject of scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators have conducted investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products and alleged unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser the practices included among other things that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes new investigative proceedings may be commenced in the future these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industrywide practices or legislation rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry and the company 

 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities restrict the conduct of our business 

 

in certain of our insurance businesses the rates we charge our policyholders are subject to regulatory approval certain lines of business are subject to a greater degree of regulatory scrutiny than others for example the workers’ 

compensation business is highly regulated for 2009 approximately 161 of our net premiums written represented primary workers’ compensation business over the past several years rates for primary workers’ compensation business written in the state of california have declined significantly as a result of workers’ compensation reform of our net premiums written during 2009 approximately 14 represented primary workers’ compensation business written in the state of california 

 

risks relating to our business 

 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses 

 

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2009 the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 973 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

 

we are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s investors our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain those ratings 

 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poor’s or moody’s our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the ongoing economic downturn we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

 

if the current conditions in the financial markets and the ongoing economic downturn continue we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and new ventures 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america australia southeast asia and canada expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

our investments in nonusdenominated securities are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or startup ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 

 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

 

risks relating to our investments 

 

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations 

 

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2009 our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 113 billion or 87 of our total investment portfolio as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 15 state and municipal securities 52 corporate securities 15 mortgagebacked securities 14 and foreign government bonds 4 

 

the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower in addition some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations 

 

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

 

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized 

investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the significant volatility and disruption currently experienced in the financial markets current and continuing economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we invest some of our assets in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity and real estate related assets which may decline in value 

 

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities merger arbitrage securities investment funds private equity and real estate related assets at december 31 2009 our investment in these assets was approximately 18 billion or 13 of our investment portfolio we reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the value of these assets of approximately 63 million in 2009 and 427 million in 2008 and losses from investment funds of 174 million in 2009 

 

merger and convertible arbitrage trading securities were 549 million or 4 of our investment portfolio at december 31 2009 merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 

 

investments in publicly traded real estate investment trusts real estate investment funds and limited partnerships and loans receivable were 701 million or 5 of our investment portfolio at december 31 2009 the values of our real estate related investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy in general and real estate valuations in particular these investments have been subject to significant volatility as a result of the current conditions in the financial markets in addition our investments in real estate related assets are less liquid than our other investments 

 

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

 

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts 

 

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries as well as regulatory restrictions during 2010 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 384 million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations or pay dividends 

 

we are subject to certain provisions that may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers which may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover and make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in addition to the economic value of losses these factors include historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves have increased under the current financial market conditions it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot assure that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

we discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience for nonproportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these discount rates range from 31 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 46 for proportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware of 25 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance is 846748000 787988000 and 699883000 at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in the aggregate discount from 2007 to 2008 and from 2006 to 2007 resulted from the increase in workers’ compensation gross reserves 

to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations these claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which are subject to significant environmental exposures 

our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 39646000 and 41590000 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 56957000 and 60836000 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 440000 7029000 and 3000000 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 2384000 2912000 and 2980000 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential affect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years amounts in thousands 

 

 

 also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information regarding the increase in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 

a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2008 as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” is as follows amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 the following table presents the development of net reserves for 1998 through 2008 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 

the “cumulative redundancy deficiency” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1998 reserves have developed a 261 million deficiency over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 1998 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 1998 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2008 to 2300 and was settled for 2300 in 2007 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 1998 through 2008

reinsurance 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “aexcellent” or better with at least 250 million in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business and the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with such regulations our insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain regulatory approval of the purchase further state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect their solvency see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

various state and federal organizations including congressional committees and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have been conducting reviews into various aspects of the insurance business no assurance can be given that future legislative or regulatory changes resulting from such activity will not adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries 

the naic utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized rbc control level as of december 31 2008 

the grammleachbliley act or financial services modernization act of 1999 the “act” was enacted in 1999 and significantly affects the financial services industry including insurance companies banks and securities firms the act modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding companies which as regulated by the act can maintain crossholdings in insurance companies banks and securities firms to an extent not previously allowed the act also permits or facilitates certain types of combinations or affiliations for financial holding companies the act establishes a functional regulatory scheme under which state insurance departments will maintain primary regulation over insurance activities subject to provisions for certain federal preemptions 

our insurance company subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled 

the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 became effective november 26 2002 was amended on december 22 2005 by the terrorism risk insurance extension act of 2005 and further amended effective december 26 2007 by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 collectively “tria” tria established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism the program is effective through december 31 2014 tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners’ multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism the most recent amendment to tria broadened the definition of certified acts to include domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will pay 85 of an insurer’s covered losses in excess of the insurer’s applicable deductible the insurer’s deductible is based on 20 percent of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2008 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2009 will be approximately 574 million the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 100 million tria limits the federal government’s share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

the insurance industry has been the subject of scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators have conducted investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products and alleged unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser the practices under investigation included among other things allegations that socalled contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes new investigative proceedings may be commenced in the future these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industrywide practices or legislation rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry and the company 

competition 

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with over 2000 insurance companies transacting business in the united states we compete directly with a large number of these companies our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices such practices are based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit competition in our industry generally changes with profitability and has increased since 2004 as a result of increased competition we have experienced both downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and conditions 

competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers standard carriers have increasingly competed for excess and surplus business 

competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include berkshire hathaway swiss re transatlantic reinsurance xl and munich re 

the regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 

the international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which may be related to government entities as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

competition from insurers based in bermuda and other tax advantaged jurisdictions has increased over the last several years including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign based entities especially as to excess and surplus lines business 

employees 

as of february 16 2009 we employed 5768 individuals of this number our subsidiaries employed 5681 persons of whom 3991 were executive and administrative personnel and 1690 were clerical personnel we employed the remaining 87 persons at the parent company and in investment operations of whom 71 were executive and administrative personnel and 16 were clerical personnel 

other information about the company’s business 

we maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 

seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 

we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues 

compliance by w r berkley and its subsidiaries with federal state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses face significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our businesses results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

risks relating to our industry 

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity over the past several years we have faced increasing competition in our business including as a result of an increased flow of capital into the insurance and reinsurance industry with both new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share this has resulted in decreased premium rates and less favorable contract terms and conditions the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return may impact rate adequacy these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

current conditions in the financial markets and the ongoing economic downturn have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if such conditions continue 

the significant volatility and uncertainty experienced in financial markets around the world during the past year and the ongoing economic downturn have continued although the us and various foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets it is unclear whether those actions will be effective therefore volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and the resulting negative economic impact will likely continue for some time 

while we monitor conditions in the financial markets we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our results of operations and financial condition depending on conditions in the financial markets we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in future periods and financial market volatility and uncertainty and an economic downturn could have a significant negative impact on third parties that we do business with including insureds and reinsurers 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves 

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 90 billion as of december 31 2008 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility such as under the current financial market conditions it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

we decreased our estimates for claims occurring in prior years by 196 million in 2008 and 106 million in 2007 and increased our estimate by 27 million in 2006 187 million in 2005 and 295 million in 2004 we along with the property casualty insurance industry in general have experienced higher than expected losses for certain types of business written from 1998 to 2001 although our reserves reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims we cannot assure you that our claim estimates will not need to be increased in the future 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes 

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results in addition through our participation in certain lloyd’s syndicates we have additional exposure to catastrophic losses for example weatherrelated losses were 114 million in 2008 34 million in 2007 39 million in 2006 99 million in 2005 and 60 million in 2004 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant and increasing competitive pressures in our businesses which have reduced premium rates and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume 

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including premium charges ratings assigned by independent rating agencies commissions paid to producers the perceived financial strength of the company other terms and conditions offered services provided speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include berkshire hathaway swiss re transatlantic reinsurance xl and munich re we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from bermuda or other tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive and pricing advantages 

over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business particularly in our reinsurance segment as increased supply has led to reduced prices our specialty segment increasingly encounters competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and may continue to experience reduced pricing and weaker terms and conditions 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts 

to the extent an act of terrorism whether a domestic or foreign act is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended on december 22 2005 and further amended on december 26 2007 “tria” for up to 85 of 

our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2008 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2009 is approximately 574 million tria is in effect through december 31 2014 unless extended or replaced by a similar program the coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

our earnings could be more volatile because of our significant level of retentions 

as compared to a number of our competitors we maintain significant retention levels in premiums written we purchase less reinsurance the process by which we transfer or cede part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company thereby retaining more risk as a result our earnings could be more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

 

state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to the current conditions in the financial markets and the ongoing economic downturn may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution also foreign governments regulate our international operations 

the insurance industry has been the subject of scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators have conducted investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products and alleged unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser the practices included among other things allegations that contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes new investigative proceedings may be commenced in the future these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industrywide practices or legislation rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry and the company 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively 

broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities restrict the conduct of our business 

in certain of our insurance businesses the rates we charge our policyholders are subject to regulatory approval certain lines of business are subject to a greater degree of regulatory scrutiny than others for example the workers’ compensation business is highly regulated for 2008 approximately 153 of our net premiums written represented primary workers’ compensation business over the past several years rates for primary workers’ compensation business written in the state of california have declined significantly as a result of workers’ compensation reform of our net premiums written during 2008 approximately 15 represented primary workers’ compensation business written in the state of california 

risks relating to our business 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses 

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2008 the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 931 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

we are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s investors our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain those ratings 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poor’s or moody’s our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates in addition we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts either our net exposures would increase or if 

we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

depending on conditions in the financial markets and the ongoing economic downturn we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 

if the current conditions in the financial markets and the ongoing economic downturn continue we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries andor to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business such as possible acquisitions and new ventures 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk 

our expanding international operations in the united kingdom continental europe south america australia canada and hong kong expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our investments in nonusdenominated securities are subject to fluctuations in nonus securities and currency markets and those markets can be volatile nonus currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our nonus subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

risks relating to our investments 

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations 

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities as of december 31 2008 our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 97 billion or 77 of our total investment portfolio as of that date our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities 12 state and municipal securities 58 corporate securities 10 mortgagebacked securities 17 and foreign government bonds 3 

the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair market value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower in addition some fixed maturity securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations 

the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities andor increases in market interest rates to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession additionally our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our efforts may not be successful impairments defaults andor rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses investment returns are currently and will likely continue to remain under pressure due to the significant volatility and disruption currently experienced in the financial markets current and continuing economic uncertainty more generally and the shape of the yield curve as a result our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we invest some of our assets in equity securities including merger arbitrage investments private equity and real estate securities which may decline in value 

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities including merger arbitrage investments private equity and real estate securities at december 31 2008 our investments in equity securities were approximately 12 billion or 9 of our investment portfolio we reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the value of our equity securities in the amounts of approximately 4273 million in 2008 27 million in 2007 01 million in 2006 and 16 million in 2005 

merger and convertible arbitrage trading securities represented 25 of our equity securities at december 31 2008 merger arbitrage is the business of investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks due to the current reduced activity and deal certainty in the merger and acquisitions area we have not been able to achieve the returns that we have enjoyed in the past 

included in our equity security portfolio are investments in publicly traded real estate investment trusts and private real estate investment funds real estate limited partnerships and private equity including venture capital investments at december 31 2008 our investments in these securities were approximately 431 million or 37 of our equity portfolio the values of our real estate investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy in general and real estate valuations in particular these investments and our private equity investments have been subject to significant volatility as a result of the current conditions in the financial markets in addition our investments in real estate investment funds real estate limited partnerships and private equity funds are less liquid than our other investments

we are subject to certain provisions that may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers which may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover and make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as our rights agreement and state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 

 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of 

claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in addition to the economic value of losses these factors include historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by external and internal events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot assure that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

 

we discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience for nonproportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve these discount rates range from 37 to 65 with a weighted average discount rate of 49 for proportional business reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware of 26 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance is 787988000 699883000 and 575485000 at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in the aggregate discount from 2006 to 2007 and from 2005 to 2006 resulted from the increase in workers’ compensation gross reserves 

 

to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations these claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which are subject to significant environmental exposures 

 

our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 41590000 and 37473000 at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 60836000 and 49937000 at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 7029000 3000000 and 1853000 in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 2912000 2980000 and 2658000 in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential affect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years amounts in thousands

the following table presents the development of net reserves for 1997 through 2007 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 

 

the “cumulative redundancy deficiency” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1997 reserves have developed a 36 million redundancy over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 1997 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 1997 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2007 to 2300 and was settled for 2300 in 2006 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 1997 through 2007 

 

 

the following table presents the development of gross reserves for 1997 through 2007 

 

 

 

reinsurance 

 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “aexcellent” or better with at least 250 million in policyholder surplus 

 

regulation 

 

our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business and the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with such regulations they are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

 

in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or 

entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain regulatory approval of the purchase further state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect their solvency see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

 

various state and federal organizations including congressional committees and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have been conducting reviews into various aspects of the insurance business no assurance can be given that future legislative or regulatory changes resulting from such activity will not adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries 

 

the naic utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized rbc control level as of december 31 2007 

 

the grammleachbliley act or financial services modernization act of 1999 the “act” was enacted in 1999 and significantly affects the financial services industry including insurance companies banks and securities firms the act modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding companies which as regulated by the act can maintain crossholdings in insurance companies banks and securities firms to an extent not previously allowed the act also permits or facilitates certain types of combinations or affiliations for financial holding companies the act establishes a functional regulatory scheme under which state insurance departments will maintain primary regulation over insurance activities subject to provisions for certain federal preemptions 

 

our insurance company subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

 

we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled 

 

the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 became effective november 26 2002 was amended on december 22 2005 by the terrorism risk insurance extension act of 2005 and further amended effective december 26 2007 by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007collectively “tria” tria established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism the program is effective through december 31 2014 tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners’ multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism the most recent amendment to tria broadened the definition of certified acts to include domestic terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will pay 85 of an insurer’s covered losses in excess of the insurer’s applicable deductible the insurer’s deductible is based on 20 percent of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2007 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2008 will be approximately 611 million 

the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 100 million tria limits the federal government’s share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap 

 

the insurance industry has been the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators have conducted investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products and alleged unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser the practices under investigation included among other things allegations that socalled contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes the new york state attorney general has entered into settlement agreements with several large insurance brokers and insurance companies new investigative proceedings may be commenced in the future these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industrywide practices or legislation rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry and the company 

 

competition 

 

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive with over 2000 insurance companies transacting business in the united states we compete directly with a large number of these companies our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices such practices are based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit competition in our industry generally changes with profitability and has increased since 2004 as a result of increased competition we are experiencing both downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and conditions 

 

competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers recently standard carriers have increasingly competed for excess and surplus business 

 

competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include berkshire hathaway swiss re transatlantic reinsurance and everest reinsurance 

 

the regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 

 

the international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which may be related to government entities as well as with branch or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

 

competition from insurers based in bermuda and other tax advantaged jurisdictions has increased over the last several years including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign based entities especially as to excess and surplus lines business 

 

employees 

 

as of february 14 2008 we employed 5494 individuals of this number our subsidiaries employed 5413 persons of whom 3846 were executive and administrative personnel and 1559 were clerical personnel we employed the remaining 81 persons at the parent company and in investment operations of whom 64 were executive and administrative personnel and 17 were clerical personnel 

other information about the company’s business 

 

we maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 

 

seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 

 

we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues 

 

compliance by w r berkley and its subsidiaries with federal state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

certain factors that may affect future results 

 

our business faces significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

 

risks relating to our industry 

 

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity over the past several years we have faced increasing competition in our business resulting in decreased premium rates primarily as a result of increased competition the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return may impact policy rates these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves 

 

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 87 billion as of december 31 2007 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling all claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on 

management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

 

we decreased our estimates for claims occurring in prior years by 106 million in 2007 and increased our estimate by 27 million in 2006 and 187 million in 2005 we along with the property casualty insurance industry in general have experienced higher than expected losses for certain types of business written from 1998 to 2001 although our reserves reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims we cannot assure you that our claim estimates will not need to be increased in the future 

 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes 

 

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results in addition through our recent quota share arrangements with certain lloyd’s syndicates we have additional exposure to catastrophic losses for example weatherrelated losses were 34 million in 2007 39 million in 2006 and 99 million in 2005 

 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we face significant and increasing competitive pressures in our businesses which have reduced premium rates and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume 

 

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors including the perceived financial strength of the company premium charges other terms and conditions offered services provided commissions paid to producers ratings assigned by independent rating agencies speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include berkshire hathaway swiss re transatlantic reinsurance and everest reinsurance company we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive and pricing advantages 

 

over the past several years we have faced increased competition in our business particularly in our reinsurance segment as increased supply has led to reduced prices we expect to continue to face strong competition in our lines of business with further reduced pricing and weaker terms and conditions 

 

this intense competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts 

 

to the extent an act of terrorism is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended on december 22 2005 and further amended on december 26 2007 “tria” for up to 85 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 percent of earned premium for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2007 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2008 will be approximately 611 million tria will be in effect through december 31 2014 unless extended or replaced by a similar program this coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 

 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

 

  

state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years also foreign governments regulate our international operations 

 

the insurance industry has been the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators have conducted investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products and alleged unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser the practices under investigation included among other things allegations that contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes the 

new york state attorney general has entered into settlement agreements with several large insurance brokers and insurance companies new investigative proceedings may be commenced in the future these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industrywide practices or legislation rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry and the company 

 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities restrict the conduct of our business 

 

in certain of our insurance businesses the rates we charge our policyholders are subject to regulatory approval certain lines of business are subject to a greater degree of regulatory scrutiny then others for example the workers’ compensation business is highly regulated during 2007 approximately 13 of our net premiums written represented primary workers’ compensation business of our net premiums written approximately 2 represented primary workers’ compensation business written in the state of california where the impact of workers’ compensation reform has recently resulted in significant rate reductions 

 

risks relating to our business 

 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses 

 

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2007 the amount due from our reinsurers was 905 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

 

we are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s investors services while am best standard  poor’s and moody’s ratings reflect their opinions as to a company’s financial strength operating performance strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders they are not evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain those ratings twenty of our twentythree insurance company subsidiaries have am best company inc “am best” ratings of “a superior” which is am best’s second highest rating out of 15 possible ratings by am best carolina casualty insurance company and w r berkley insurance europe limited have am best ratings of “a excellent” which is am best’s third highest rating investors guaranty life insurance company which the company purchased in 2007 does not have an am best rating the standard  poor’s financial strength rating for our domestic insurance subsidiaries is a the seventh highest rating out of twentyseven possible ratings our moody’s rating is a2 for berkley insurance company the sixth highest rating out of twentyone possible ratings 

 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poor’s or moody’s our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our 

products a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks 

 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 

 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

 

risks relating to our investments 

 

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is subject to market fluctuations 

 

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income securities as of december 31 2007 our investment in fixed income securities was approximately 98 billion or 74 of our total investment portfolio 

 

the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair market value of fixed income securities generally decreases as interest rates rise conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed income securities will be lower in addition some fixed income securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations based upon the composition and duration of our investment portfolio at december 31 2007 a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of approximately 338 million 

the value of investments in fixed income securities and particularly our investments in highyield securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer or increases in market interest rates although we attempt to manage this risk by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities investment returns are currently and could continue to remain under pressure due to current economic uncertainty and volatility and the shape of the yield curve 

 

the value of our fixed income portfolio is also subject to the risk that certain investments may become impaired due to a downgrade of the credit ratings of an insurer that guarantees an issuer’s payments of such investments in our portfolio in addition defaults by the issuer and where applicable its guarantor of certain investments that result in the failure of such parties to fulfill their obligations with regard to any of these investments could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses 

 

while we attempt to manage these risks through investment guidelines collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms our efforts may not be successful to a large degree the credit risk we face is a function of the economy accordingly we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession as a result our exposure to any of the above credit risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we invest some of our assets in equity securities including merger arbitrage investments private equity and real estate securities which may decline in value 

 

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities including merger arbitrage investments private equity and real estate securities at december 31 2007 our investments in equity securities were approximately 18 billion or 15 of our investment portfolio we reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the value of our equity securities provisions in the amounts of 27 million in 2007 01 million in 2006 and 16 million in 2005 

 

merger and convertible arbitrage trading securities represented 25 of our equity securities at december 31 2007 merger arbitrage is the business of investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks if there is reduced activity in the merger and acquisitions area we may not be able achieve the returns that we have enjoyed in the past 

 

included in our equity security portfolio are investments in publicly traded real estate investment trusts “reits” and private real estate investment funds real estate limited partnerships and venture capital investments at december 31 2007 our investments in these securities were approximately 504 million or 29 of our equity portfolio the values of our real estate investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy in general and real estate valuations in particular in addition the real estate investment funds limited partnerships and venture capital investments in which we invest are less liquid than our other investments 

 

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

 

we are an insurance holding company and may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts 

 

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries as well as the regulatory restrictions during 2008 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 653 million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations or pay dividends 

we are subject to certain provisions that may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers which may prevent our shareholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover and make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as our rights agreement and state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 

 

these provisions include

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 

 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal 

and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in addition to the economic value of losses these factors include historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by internal and external events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage and legislative changes which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot assure that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

 

we discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies writing similar business the liabilities for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve for nonproportional business and at the statutory rate for proportional business the discount rates range from 27 to 65 with a weighted average rate of 47 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance is 699883000 575485000 and 502874000 at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in the aggregate discount from 2005 to 2006 and from 2004 to 2005 resulted from the increase in workers’ compensation gross reserves 

 

to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations environmental claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which are subject to significant environmental exposures 

 

our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 37473000 and 37453000 at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 49937000 and 53731000 at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 3000000 1853000 and 9194000 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 2980000 2658000 and 2802000 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential affect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain

the following table presents the development of net reserves for 1996 through 2006 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 

 

the “cumulative redundancy deficiency” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1996 reserves have developed a 214 million redundancy over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 1996 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 1996 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2006 to 2300 and was settled for 2300 in 2006 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 1996 through 2006

reinsurance 

 

we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with at least 500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “aexcellent” or better with at least 250 million in policyholder surplus 

 

regulation 

 

our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business and the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with such regulations they are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

 

in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership 

financial condition and general business operations under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain regulatory approval of the purchase under florida law which is applicable to us due to our ownership of carolina casualty insurance company a florida domiciled insurer the acquisition of more than 5 of our capital stock must receive regulatory approval further state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect their solvency see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

 

various state and federal organizations including congressional committees and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have been conducting reviews into various aspects of the insurance business no assurance can be given that future legislative or regulatory changes resulting from such activity will not adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries 

 

the naic utilizes a risk based capital “rbc” formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized rbc control level as of december 31 2006 

 

the grammleachbliley act or financial services modernization act of 1999 the “act” was enacted in 1999 and significantly affects the financial services industry including insurance companies banks and securities firms the act modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding companies which as regulated by the act can maintain crossholdings in insurance companies banks and securities firms to an extent not previously allowed the act also permits or facilitates certain types of combinations or affiliations for financial holding companies the act establishes a functional regulatory scheme under which state insurance departments will maintain primary regulation over insurance activities subject to provisions for certain federal preemptions 

 

our insurance company subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

 

we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled 

 

the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 became effective november 26 2002 and was amended on december 22 2005 by the terrorism risk insurance extension act of 2005 together “tria” tria establishe a temporary federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism the program is scheduled to terminate on december 31 2007 tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will pay 85 in 2007 of an insurer’s covered losses in excess of the insurer’s applicable deductible the insurer’s deductible is based on a percent of earned premium for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance for 2007 it will be 20 

of 2006 premium based on our 2006 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2007 will increase to approximately 618 million as of 2007 the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 100 million tria limits the federal government’s share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap after december 31 2007 there will not be a federal program available for terrorism losses unless tria is further extended or replaced at such time the company will have the option to exclude terrorism losses from coverage except for any lines of insurance or jurisdictions where exclusions are not permitted 

 

the insurance industry recently has become the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators have commenced investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products and alleged unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser the practices currently under investigation include among other things allegations that socalled contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes the new york state attorney general has entered into settlement agreements with several large insurance brokers and insurance companies these investigations and proceedings are expected to continue and new investigative proceedings may be commenced in the future these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industrywide practices or legislation rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry and the company following the public disclosure of the new york state attorney general’s investigation the company commenced an internal review with the assistance of outside counsel that focused on the company’s relationships with its distribution channels as a result of its investigation the company uncovered at a single insurance operating unit certain limited instances of conduct that could be characterized as involving inappropriate solicitation practices that operating unit has reached an agreement with its domiciliary insurance regulator resolving all issues pertaining to such regulator’s inquiry without penalty 

 

competition 

 

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are competitive with over 2000 insurance companies transacting business in the united states we compete directly with a large number of these companies our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices such practices are based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit competition in the industry generally changes with profitability 

 

competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers under certain market conditions standard carriers also compete for excess and surplus business 

 

competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include berkshire hathaway swiss re transatlantic reinsurance and everest reinsurance 

 

the regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 

 

the international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which may be related to government entities as well as with branch or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

 

competition from bermuda and other tax advantaged jurisdictions has increased over the last several years including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign based entities 

 

employees

certain factors that may affect future results 

 

our business faces significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

 

risks relating to our industry 

 

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return may impact policy rates these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves 

 

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 78 billion as of december 31 2006 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling all claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

 

we increased our estimates for claims occurring in prior years by 27 million in 2006 187 million in 2005 and 295 million in 2004 we along with the property casualty insurance industry in general have experienced higher than expected losses for certain types of business written from 1998 to 2001 although our reserves reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims we cannot assure you that our claim estimates will not need to be increased in the future 

 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies writing similar business changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes 

 

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results in addition through our recent quota share arrangements with certain lloyd’s syndicates we have additional exposure to catastrophic losses for example weatherrelated losses were 39 million in 2006 99 million in 2005 and 60 million in 2004 

 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which may reduce premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at attractive rates 

 

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies competition in our businesses is based on many factors including the perceived financial strength of the company premium charges other terms and conditions offered services provided commissions paid to producers ratings assigned by independent rating agencies speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written 

 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include berkshire hathaway swiss re transatlantic reinsurance and everest reinsurance company we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with competitive advantages 

 

new competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates 

 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts 

 

to the extent an act of terrorism is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended on december 22 2005 “tria” for up to 90 in 2006 85 in 2007 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on a percent of earned premium for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2006 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2007 will increase to approximately 618 million which is a result of an increase in premium and an increase in the applicable deductible percentage from 175 in 2006 to 200 in 2007 in addition even the coverage provided under tria is scheduled to terminate on december 31 2007 unless extended or replaced by a similar program this coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 

 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

 

  

state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years also foreign governments regulate our international operations 

 

the insurance industry recently has become the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices the new york state attorney general and other state 

and federal regulators have commenced investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products and alleged unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser the practices currently under investigation include among other things allegations that contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes the new york state attorney general has entered into settlement agreements with several large insurance brokers and insurance companies these investigations and proceedings are expected to continue and new investigative proceedings may be commenced in the future these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industrywide practices or legislation rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry and the company for example following the public disclosure of the new york state attorney general’s investigation the company commenced an internal review with the assistance of outside counsel that focused on the company’s relationships with its distribution channels as a result of its investigation the company uncovered at a single insurance operating unit certain limited instances of conduct that could be characterized as involving inappropriate solicitation practices that operating unit has reached an agreement with its domiciliary insurance regulator resolving all issues pertaining to such regulator’s inquiry without penalty we cannot assure you that regulators will not make further inquiries in the future 

 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities restrict the conduct of our business 

 

in certain of our insurance businesses the rates we charge our policyholders are subject to regulatory approval certain lines of business are subject to a greater degree of regulatory scrutiny then others for example the workers’ compensation business is highly regulated during 2006 approximately 19 of our net premiums written represented primary workers’ compensation business of our net premiums written approximately 3 represented primary workers’ compensation business written in the state of california where the impact of workers compensation reform has resulted in significant reductions 

 

risks relating to our business 

 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses 

 

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2006 the amount due from our reinsurers was 928 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 

 

we are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s investors services while am best standard  poor’s and moody’s ratings reflect their opinions as to a 

company’s financial strength operating performance strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders they are not evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain those ratings five of our insurance subsidiaries admiral insurance company nautilus insurance company admiral indemnity company great divide insurance company and clermont insurance company have am best ratings of “a superior” which is am best’s second highest rating all of our other domestic insurance subsidiaries and w r berkley insurance europe limited have am best ratings of “a excellent” which is the third highest rating out of 15 possible ratings by a m best the standard  poor’s financial strength rating for our domestic insurance subsidiaries is a the seventh highest rating out of twentyseven possible ratings our moody’s rating is a2 for berkley insurance company the sixth highest rating out of twentyone possible ratings 

 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poor’s or moody’s our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks 

 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 

 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

 

risks relating to our investments 

 

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is subject to market fluctuations 

 

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income securities as of december 31 2006 our investment in fixed income securities was approximately 92 billion or 82 of our total investment portfolio 

 

the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair market value of fixed income securities generally decreases as interest rates rise conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed income securities will be lower in addition some fixed income securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations based upon the composition and duration of our investment portfolio at december 31 2006 a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of approximately 300 million 

 

the value of investments in fixed income securities and particularly our investments in highyield securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer or increases in market interest rates although we attempt to manage this risk by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities 

 

we invest some of our assets in equity securities including merger arbitrage investments and real estate securities which may decline in value 

 

we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities including merger arbitrage investments and investments in affiliates at december 31 2006 our investments in equity securities were approximately 20 billion or 18 of our investment portfolio we reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the value of our equity securities provisions in the amounts of 01 million in 2006 16 million in 2005 and 28 million in 2004 

 

merger and convertible arbitrage trading securities represented 33 of our equity securities at december 31 2006 merger arbitrage is the business of investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks if there is reduced activity in the merger and acquisitions area we may not be able achieve the returns that we have enjoyed in the past 

 

included in our equity security portfolio are investments in publicly traded real estate investment trusts “reits” and private real estate investment funds real estate limited partnerships and venture capital investments at december 31 2006 our investments in these securities were approximately 549 million or 28 of our equity portfolio the values of our real estate investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy in general and real estate valuations in particular in addition the real estate investment funds limited partnerships and venture capital investments in which we invest are less liquid than our other investments 

 

risks relating to purchasing our securities 

 

we are an insurance holding company and may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts 

 

as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries as well as the regulatory restrictions during 2007 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 603 

million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations or pay dividends 

 

we are subject to certain provisions that may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers which may prevent our shareholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover and make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 

 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as our rights agreement and state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 

to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss 

in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not yet reported to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in addition to the economic value of losses these factors include historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by internal and external events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage and legislative changes which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot assure that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

we discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies writing similar business the liabilities for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve for nonproportional business and at the statutory rate for proportional business the discount rates range from 27 to 65 with a weighted average rate of 48 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance is 575485000 502874000 and 393152000 at december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in the aggregate discount from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 resulted from the increase in workers’ compensation reserves 

to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations environmental claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which are subject to significant environmental exposures 

our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 37453000 and 38258000 at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 53731000 and 54971000 at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 1853000 9194000 and 4749000 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 2658000 2802000 and 1391000 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential affect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain

the following table presents the development of net reserves for 1995 through 2005 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 

the “cumulative redundancy deficiency” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1995 reserves have developed a 215 million redundancy over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 1995 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 1995 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2005 to 2300 and was settled for 2300 in 2005 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 1995 through 2004

reinsurance 

we follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with 500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “aexcellent” or better with 250 million in policyholder surplus 

regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business and the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with such regulations they are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of certain policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 

in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain regulatory approval of the purchase under florida law which is applicable to us due to our ownership of carolina casualty insurance company a florida domiciled insurer the acquisition of 

more than 5 of our capital stock must receive regulatory approval further state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect their solvency see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

various state and federal organizations including congressional committees and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have been conducting reviews into various aspects of the insurance business no assurance can be given that future legislative or regulatory changes resulting from such activity will not adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries 

the naic utilizes a risk based capital rbc formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized rbc control level as of december 31 2005 

the grammleachbliley act or financial services modernization act of 1999 the “act” was enacted in 1999 and significantly affects the financial services industry including insurance companies banks and securities firms the act modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding companies which as regulated by the act can maintain crossholdings in insurance companies banks and securities firms to an extent not previously allowed the act also permits or facilitates certain types of combinations or affiliations for financial holding companies the act establishes a functional regulatory scheme under which state insurance departments will maintain primary regulation over insurance activities subject to provisions for certain federal preemptions 

our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in that jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 

we receive funds from our insurance subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled 

the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 “tria” became effective november 26 2002 and was amended december 22 2005 by the terrorism risk insurance extension act of 2005 together “tria” tria establishes a temporary federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism the program is scheduled to terminate on december 31 2007 tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multiperil insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will pay 90 in 2006 85 in 2007 of an insurer’s losses in excess of the insurer’s applicable deductible the insurer’s deductible is based on a percent of earned premium for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance for 2005 it was 15 of 2004 premium and for 2006 it is 175 of 2005 premium and for 2007 it will be 20 of 2006 premium based on our 2005 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2006 will increase to approximately 548 million as of april 1 2005 the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 50 million which amount increases to 100 million in 2007 tria limits the federal government’s share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap after december 31 2007 there will not be a federal program available for terrorism losses unless tria is further extended at such time the company will have the option to exclude terrorism losses from coverage except for any lines of insurance or jurisdictions where exclusions are not 

permitted tria calls for a federal study to be completed by september 30 2006 of the longterm availability and affordability of terrorism insurance 

the insurance industry recently has become the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators have commenced investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products and alleged unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser the practices currently under investigation include among other things allegations that socalled contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes the new york state attorney general has entered into settlement agreements with several large insurance brokers against whom civil complaints had been filed these investigations and proceedings are expected to continue and new investigative proceedings may be commenced in the future these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industrywide practices or legislation rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry following the public disclosure of the new york state attorney general’s investigation the company commenced an internal review with the assistance of outside counsel that focused on the company’s relationships with its distribution channels as a result of its investigation the company uncovered at a single insurance operating unit certain limited instances of conduct that could be characterized as involving inappropriate solicitation practices that operating unit has reached an agreement with its domiciliary insurance regulator resolving all issues pertaining to its inquiry without penalty 

competition 

the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are competitive with over 2000 insurance companies transacting business in the united states we compete directly with a large number of these companies our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices such practices are based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the general intent of making an underwriting profit competition in the industry generally changes with profitability 

competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers under certain market conditions standard carriers also compete for excess and surplus business 

competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include berkshire hathaway swiss re transatlantic reinsurance and everest reinsurance 

the regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 

the international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which may be related to government entities as well as with branch or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 

employees 

as of february 14 2006 we employed 4961 persons of this number our subsidiaries employed 4894 persons of whom 3214 were executive and administrative personnel and 1680 were clerical personnel we employed the remaining 67 persons at the parent company and in investment operations of whom 46 were executive and administrative personnel and 21 were clerical personnel 

other information about the company’s business 

we maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 

seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries although the effect on our business of such 

catastrophes as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 

we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues 

compliance by w r berkley and its subsidiaries with federal state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

certain factors that may affect future results 

our business faces significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

risks relating to our industry 

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 

the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return may impact policy rates these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves 

our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 67 billion as of december 31 2005 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling all claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 

reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 

the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure you that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the period would decrease by a corresponding amount 

we increased our estimates for claims occurring in prior years by 187 million in 2005 295 million in 2004 and 245 million in 2003 we along with the property casualty insurance industry in general have experienced higher than expected losses for certain types of business written from 1998 to 2001 although our reserves reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims we cannot assure you that our claim estimates will not need to be increased in the future 

we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies writing similar business changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes 

property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results in addition through our recent quota share arrangements with certain lloyd’s syndicates we have additional exposure to catastrophic losses for example weatherrelated losses were 38 million in 2003 60 million in 2004 and 99 million in 2005 

catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which may reduce premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at attractive rates 

we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies competition in our businesses is based on many factors including the perceived financial strength of the company premium charges other terms and conditions offered services provided commissions paid to producers ratings assigned by independent rating agencies speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written 

some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include berkshire hathaway swiss re transatlantic reinsurance and everest reinsurance company we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from tax advantaged jurisdictions and have the ability to offer lower rates due to such tax advantages 

new competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates 

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts 

to the extent an act of terrorism is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 as amended december 22 2005 “tria” for up to 90 in 2006 85 in 2007 of our losses for certain propertycasualty lines of insurance however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on a percent of earned premium for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2005 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2006 will increase to approximately 548 million which is a result of an increase in premium and an increase in the applicable deductible percentage 

from 15 in 2005 to 175 in 2006 the deductible percentage increases to 20 in 2007 in addition the coverage provided under tria is scheduled to terminate on december 31 2007 unless extended or replaced by a similar program even this coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things 

 

state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years also foreign governments regulate our international operations 

the insurance industry recently has become the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators have commenced investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products and alleged unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser the practices currently under investigation include among other things allegations that contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes the new york state attorney general has entered into settlement agreements with certain parties against whom civil complaints had been filed these investigations and proceedings are expected to continue and new investigative proceedings may be commenced in the future these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industrywide practices or legislation rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry for example following the public disclosure of the new york state attorney general’s investigation the company commenced an internal review with the assistance of outside counsel that focused on the company’s relationships with its distribution channels as a result of its investigation the company uncovered at a single insurance operating unit certain limited instances of conduct that could be characterized as involving inappropriate solicitation practices that operating unit has reached an agreement with its domiciliary insurance regulator resolving all issues pertaining to its inquiry without penalty 

we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities restrict the conduct of our business 

in certain of our insurance businesses the rates we charge our policyholders are subject to regulatory approval certain lines of business are subject to a greater degree of regulatory scrutiny then others for example the workers’ compensation business is highly regulated during 2005 approximately 12 of our net premiums written represented primary workers’ compensation business of our net premiums written approximately 4 represented primary workers’ compensation business written in the state of california which is undergoing workers’ compensation reform that may adversely affect our ability to adjust rates 

risks relating to our business 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses 

we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2005 the amount due from our reinsurers was 954 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or held in trust on our behalf 

we are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 

ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s investors services while am best standard  poor’s and moody’s ratings reflect their opinions as to a company’s financial strength operating performance strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders they are not evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain those ratings two of our insurance subsidiaries admiral insurance company and clermont insurance company have am best ratings of “a superior” which is am best’s second highest rating all of other domestic insurance subsidiaries and w r berkley insurance europe limited have am best ratings of “a excellent” which is the third highest rating out of 15 possible ratings by a m best the standard  poor’s financial strength rating for our domestic insurance subsidiaries is a the seventh highest rating out of twentyseven possible ratings our moody’s rating is a2 for berkley insurance company the sixth highest rating out of twentyone possible ratings 

if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poor’s or moody’s our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings 

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 

as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks 

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 

as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 

we depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

risks relating to our investments 

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is subject to market fluctuations 

our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income securities as of december 31 2005 our investment in fixed income securities was approximately 85 billion or 82 of our total investment portfolio 

the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair market value of fixed income securities generally decreases as interest rates rise conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed income securities will be lower in addition some fixed income securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations based upon the composition and duration of our investment portfolio at december 31 2005 a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of approximately 352 million 

the value of investments in fixed income securities and particularly our investments in highyield securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer although we attempt to manage this risk by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities for example although there were no provisions for other than temporary impairments in 2005 or 2004 we reported a provision for other than temporary impairments in the value of our fixed income investments of 430000 in 2003 

we invest some of our assets in equity securities including merger arbitrage investments and real estate securities which may decline in value

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses either known or unknown insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not yet reported to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 13 

in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered in addition to the economic value of losses these factors include historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments may be revised this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company’s control these variables are affected by internal and external events such as inflation and economic volatility judicial and litigation trends reinsurance coverage and legislative changes which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made because setting reserves is inherently uncertain the company cannot assure that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events we discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies writing similar business the liabilities for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve for nonproportional business and at the statutory rate for proportional business the discount rates range from 35 to 65 with a weighted average rate of 48 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance is 502874000 393152000 and 292697000 at december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in the aggregate discount from 2003 to 2004 and from 2002 to 2003 resulted from the increase in workers’ compensation reserves to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations environmental claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which are subject to significant environmental exposures our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 38258000 and 31866000 at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 54971000 and 49283000 at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 9194000 4749000 and 6652000 in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 2802000 1391000 and 2938000 in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential affect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain 14

 also see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information regarding the increase in estimates for claims occurring in prior years a reconciliation between the reserves as of december 31 2004 as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” is as follows amounts in thousands  

 15 

the following table presents the development of net reserves for 1994 through 2004 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years the “cumulative redundancy deficiency” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1994 reserves have developed a 170 million redundancy over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 1994 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 1994 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2004 to 2300 and was settled for 2300 in 2004 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 1994 through 2003  

the following table presents the development of gross reserves for 1994 through 2004  

reinsurance we follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with 500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “aexcellent” or better with 250 million in policyholder surplus as a result of the attacks of september 11 2001 many reinsurers have significantly changed their underwriting guidelines and limit or no longer provide terrorism coverage see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations” and note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” regulation our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business and the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with such regulations they are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain regulatory approval of the purchase under florida law which is applicable to us due to 17 

our ownership of carolina casualty insurance company a florida domiciled insurer the acquisition of more than 5 of our capital stock must receive regulatory approval further state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect their solvency see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” various state and federal organizations including congressional committees and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have been conducting reviews into various aspects of the insurance business no assurance can be given that future legislative or regulatory changes resulting from such activity will not adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries the naic utilizes a risk based capital rbc formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized rbc control level as of december 31 2004 the grammleachbliley act or financial services modernization act of 1999 the “act” was enacted in 1999 and significantly affects the financial services industry including insurance companies banks and securities firms the act modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding companies which as regulated by the act can maintain crossholdings in insurance companies banks and securities firms to an extent not previously allowed the act also permits or facilitates certain types of combinations or affiliations for financial holding companies the act establishes a functional regulatory scheme under which state insurance departments will maintain primary regulation over insurance activities subject to provisions for certain federal preemptions our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in that jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business we receive funds from our insurance subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 “tria” became effective november 26 2002 tria establishes a temporary federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism the program is scheduled to terminate on december 31 2005 tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will pay 90 of an insurer’s losses in excess of the insurer’s applicable deductible the insurer’s deductible is based on a percent of earned premium for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance for 2004 it was 10 of 2003 premium and for 2005 it is 15 of 2004 premium based on our 2004 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2005 will increase to approximately 517 million tria limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap after december 31 2005 there will not be a federal program available for terrorism losses unless tria is extended or replaced at such time the company will have the option to exclude terrorism losses from coverage except for any lines of insurance or jurisdictions where exclusions were not permitted before tria was enacted 18 

the insurance industry recently has become the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators have commenced investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products and unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser the practices currently under investigation include among other things allegations that socalled contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes the new york state attorney general has recently entered into settlement agreements with two large insurance brokers against whom civil complaints had been filed these investigations and proceedings are expected to continue and new investigative proceedings may be commenced in the future these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industrywide practices or legislation rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry competition the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are competitive with over 2000 insurance companies transacting business in the united states we compete directly with a large number of these companies our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices such practices are based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the general intent of making an underwriting profit competition in the industry generally changes with profitability competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers under certain market conditions standard carriers also compete for excess and surplus business competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include berkshire hathaway ge insurance solutions transatlantic reinsurance and everest reinsurance which collectively comprise a majority of the property casualty reinsurance market in the united states the regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company the international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which may be related to government entities as well as with branch or local subsidiaries of multinational companies employees as of february 28 2005 we employed 4736 persons of this number our subsidiaries employed 4671 persons of whom 2709 were executive and administrative personnel and 1962 were clerical personnel we employed the remaining 65 persons at the parent company and in investment operations of whom 49 were executive and administrative personnel and 16 were clerical personnel other information about the company’s business we maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition the insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries although the effect on our business of such catastrophes as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 19 

we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues compliance by w r berkley and its subsidiaries with federal state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position the company’s internet address is wwwwrberkleycom the information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k the corporation’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act are accessible free of charge through this website as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission 20 

certain factors that may affect future results our business faces significant risks if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected risks relating to our industry our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return may impact policy rates these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 54 billion as of december 31 2004 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling all claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure you that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax income for the period would decrease by a corresponding amount we increased our estimates for claims occurring in prior years by 295 million in 2004 245 million in 2003 and 156 million in 2002 we along with the property casualty insurance industry in general have experienced higher than expected losses for certain types of business written from 1998 to 2001 although our reserves reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims we cannot assure you that our claim estimates will not need to be increased in the future we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies writing similar business changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 21 

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results in addition through our recent quota share arrangements with certain lloyd’s syndicates we have additional exposure to catastrophic losses for example weatherrelated losses were 29 million in 2002 38 million in 2003 and 60 million in 2004 catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which may reduce premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at attractive rates we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies competition in our businesses is based on many factors including the perceived financial strength of the company premium charges other terms and conditions offered services provided commissions paid to producers ratings assigned by independent rating agencies speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include berkshire hathaway ge insurance solutions transatlantic reinsurance and everest reinsurance company which collectively comprise a majority of the us property casualty reinsurance market we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers certain of our competitors operate from tax advantaged jurisdictions and have the ability to offer lower rates due to such tax advantages new competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts to the extent that reinsurers have excluded coverage for terrorist acts or have priced such coverage at rates that we believe are not practical we in our capacity as a primary insurer do not have reinsurance protection and are exposed for potential losses as a result of any terrorist acts for example our losses from the world trade center attack in 2001 were 35 million we have particular exposure to terrorist acts as a provider of insurance for habitational risks in the new york metropolitan area and as a workers’ compensation insurer to the extent an act of terrorism is certified by the secretary of treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 “tria” for up to 90 of our losses however any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on a percent of earned premium for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2004 earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2005 will increase to approximately 517 million if tria is not extended beyond its stated termination date of december 31 2005 or replaced by a similar program our liability for terrorist acts could be a material amount in addition even this coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 22 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things  state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years also foreign governments regulate our international operations the insurance industry recently has become the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators have commenced investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products and unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser the practices currently under investigation include among other things allegations that socalled contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes the new york state attorney general has recently entered into settlement agreements with two large insurance brokers against whom civil complaints had been filed these investigations and proceedings are expected to continue and new investigative proceedings may be commenced in the future these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industrywide practices or legislation rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities restrict the conduct of our business in certain of our insurance businesses the rates we charge our policyholders are subject to regulatory approval certain lines of business are subject to a greater degree of regulatory scrutiny then others for example the workers’ compensation business is highly regulated during 2004 approximately 13 of our net premiums written represented primary workers’ compensation business of our net premiums written approximately 5 represented primary workers’ compensation business written in the state of california which is undergoing workers’ compensation reform that may adversely affect our ability to adjust rates risks relating to our business we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to 23 

our policyholders our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims as of december 31 2004 the amount due from our reinsurers was 851 million including amounts due from state funds and industry pools certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or held in trust on our behalf we are rated by am best and standard  poor’s and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poor’s and moody’s investors services am best standard  poor’s and moody’s ratings reflect their opinions of an insurance company’s financial strength operating performance strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders are not evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our ratings are subject to periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain those ratings all of the domestic insurance subsidiaries except admiral insurance company have an am best company inc “am best” rating of “a excellent” which is the third highest rating out of 15 possible ratings by a m best admiral insurance company has a rating of “a superior” which is am best’s second highest rating w r berkley insurance europe limited has a rating of “a excellent” which is am best’s fourth highest rating the standard  poor’s financial strength rating for our insurance subsidiaries is anegative the seventh highest rating out of twentyseven possible ratings our moody’s rating is a2 for berkley insurance company the sixth highest rating out of twentyone possible ratings if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best standard  poor’s or moody’s our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks our international operations expose us to investment political and economic risks our international operations including our recent ukbased operations expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example argentina has recently experienced substantial political and economic problems including debt restructuring and the devaluation of the argentinean peso as a result we recorded a charge of 18 million in 2001 and 10 million in 2002 to recognize other than temporary impairment of our investment in argentine bonds we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our 24 

future acquisitions or ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees we depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets risks relating to our investments a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is subject to market fluctuations our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income securities as of december 31 2004 our investment in fixed income securities was approximately 64 billion or 76 of our total investment portfolio the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the fair market value of fixed income securities generally decreases as interest rates rise conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from future investments in fixed income securities will be lower in addition some fixed income securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations based upon the composition and duration of our investment portfolio at december 31 2004 a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of approximately 258 million the value of investments in fixed income securities and particularly our investments in highyield securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer although we attempt to manage this risk by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities for example we reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the value of our fixed income investments of 16 million in 2002 and 430000 in 2003 we invest some of our assets in equity securities including merger arbitrage investments and real estate securities which may decline in value we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities including merger arbitrage investments and investments in affiliates at december 31 2004 our investments in equity securities were approximately 934 million or 11 of our investment portfolio although we did not report any provisions for “other than temporary impairments” in the value of our equity securities in 2003 we reported such provisions in the amounts of 27 million in 2002 and 28 million in 2004 merger and convertible arbitrage trading represented 38 of our equity securities at december 31 2004 merger arbitrage is the business of investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks as a result of the reduced activity in the merger and acquisitions area we may not be able achieve the returns that we have enjoyed in the past included in our equity security portfolio are investments in publicly traded real estate investment trusts “reits” and private real estate investment funds real estate limited partnerships and venture capital investments  at december 31 2004 our investments in these securities were approximately 311 million or 30 of our equity portfolio the values of our real estate investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy in general and real estate valuations in particular in addition the real estate investment funds limited partnerships and venture capital investments in which we invest are less liquid than our other investments 25 

risks relating to purchasing our securities we are an insurance holding company and may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts as an insurance holding company our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries as well as the regulatory restrictions during 2005 the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 270 million as a result in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations or pay dividends we are subject to certain provisions that may have the effect of hindering delaying or preventing third party takeovers which may prevent our shareholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover and make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as our rights agreement and state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors these provisions include

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves

         in the property casualty insurance industry it is not unusual for
significant periods of time to elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss
the report of the loss to the insurer and the insurers payment of that loss to
recognize liabilities for unpaid losses insurers establish reserves which is a
balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay
claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred
our loss reserves reflect current estimates of the ultimate cost of closing
outstanding claims other than our excess workers compensation business and the
workers compensation portion of our reinsurance business as discussed below
we do not discount our reserves for financial reporting purposes

         in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a
case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment the estimate
represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and
reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the
nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on
an aggregate basis which provide for losses incurred but not yet reported to the
insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves the estimated expenses of
settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of
administering the claims adjustment process lae and a provision for
potentially uncollectible reinsurance

         in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered
including historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and
economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process
relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for
the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate
basis for predicting future events reserve amounts are necessarily based on
managements informed estimates and judgments using data currently available as
additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these
estimates and judgments are revised this may result in increases or decreases
to reserves for insured events of prior years the reserving process implicitly
recognizes the impact of inflation and other factors affecting loss costs by
taking into account changes in historical claim patterns and perceived trends
there is no precise method to evaluate the impact of any specific factor on the
adequacy of reserves because the ultimate cost of closing claims is influenced
by numerous factors

         while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over
time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns
are subject to fluctuation in particular high levels of jury verdicts against
insurers as well as judicial decisions which reformulate policies to expand
coverage to include previously unforeseen theories of liability eg those
regarding pollution other environmental exposures or manmade catastrophes
have produced unanticipated claims and increased the difficulty of estimating
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves

         we discount our liabilities for excess workers compensation business
and the workers compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the
long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to
appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment
securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense
payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the companys loss payout
experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies
writing similar business the liabilities for losses and loss expenses have been
discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us
treasury yield curve for nonproportional business and at the statutory rate
for proportional business the discount rates range from 39 to 65 with a
weighted average rate of 50 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the
effects of ceded reinsurance is 393000000 293000000 and 243000000 at
december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in the aggregate
discount from 2002 to 2003 and from 2001 to 2002 resulted from the increase in
workers compensation reserves

         to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance
company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations
environmental claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries
generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which are subject to
significant environmental exposures

         our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to
asbestos and environmental claims were 31866000 and 28509000 at december
31 2003 and 2002 respectively the companys gross reserves for losses and
loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were
49283000 and 47637000 at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively net
incurred losses and loss expenses recoveries for reported asbestos and
environmental claims were approximately 4749000 6652000 and 4503000
in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively net paid losses and loss expenses
receivables for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately
1391000 2938000 and 125000 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the
estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal
variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial
estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted
actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential affect of
significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the
cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate
damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible
parties are highly uncertain

         the following table presents the development of net reserves for 1993
through 2003 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid
losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the
indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss
expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance
sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to us
the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously
recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the
estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and
severity of claims for individual years

         the cumulative redundancy deficiency represents the aggregate
change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1993 reserves
have developed a 161 million redundancy over ten years that amount has been
reflected in income over the ten years the impact on the results of operations
of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the
reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a run
off of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss
development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes
in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in
1993 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 1993 assuming this claim
estimate was changed in 2003 to 2300 and was settled for 2300 in 2003 the
300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 1993 through
2002

reinsurance

         we follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of
our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the
policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net
liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses
although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary
liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming
reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we
monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our
coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result
generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am
best rating of a excellent or better with 500 million in policyholder
surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am
best rating of aexcellent or better with 250 million in policyholder
surplus as a result of the attacks of september 11 2001 many reinsurers have
significantly changed their underwriting guidelines and limit or no longer
provide terrorism coverage see managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and result of operations and note 10 of notes to
consolidated financial statements

regulation

         our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation
and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business and the company
believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with such
regulations they are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory
and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation
relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and
maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and
limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of
policyholders approval of policy forms and premium rates periodic examination
of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be
filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes
establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses and
requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty
subsidiaries other than es and reinsurance subsidiaries must generally file
all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our
excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate
and form regulation

         in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we
are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems
typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the
state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital
structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under
the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to
purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding
voting securities would be required to obtain regulatory approval of the
purchase under florida law which is applicable to us due to our ownership of
carolina casualty insurance company a florida domiciled insurer the
acquisition of more than 5 of our capital stock must receive regulatory
approval further state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the
amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in
order to protect their solvency see managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources

         various state and federal organizations including congressional
committees and the national association of insurance commissioners naic
have been conducting reviews into various aspects of the insurance business the
naic codified statutory accounting practices for certain insurance enterprises
effective january 1 2001 no assurance can be given that future legislative or
regulatory changes resulting from such activity will not adversely affect our
insurance subsidiaries

         the naic utilizes a risk based capital rbc formula which is designed
to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the
risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target
level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various
asset premium and reserve items the rbc model law provides for four
incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below
the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from
requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing
the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance
subsidiaries was above the authorized rbc control level as of december 31 2003

         the grammleachbliley act or financial services modernization act of
1999 the act was enacted in 1999 and significantly affects the financial
services industry including insurance companies banks and securities firms
the act modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding
companies which as regulated by the act can maintain crossholdings in
insurance companies banks and securities firms to an extent not previously
allowed the act also permits or facilitates certain types of combinations or
affiliations for financial

                                       17

holding companies the act establishes a functional regulatory scheme under
which state insurance departments will maintain primary regulation over
insurance activities subject to provisions for certain federal preemptions

         our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state
guaranty funds when an insurer in that jurisdiction has been judicially declared
insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to
pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a states
guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to
state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be
members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of
direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which
many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject
premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise
several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance
subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with
regard to deficits in certain lines of business

         we receive funds from our insurance subsidiaries in the form of
dividends and management fees for certain management services annual dividends
in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid
without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an
insurance subsidiary is domiciled

         the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 tria became effective
november 26 2002 tria establishes a temporary federal program that provides
for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses
resulting from acts of terrorism the program terminates on december 31 2005
tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty
insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance
exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and
make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism federal participation
will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of
terrorism under the program the federal government will pay 90 of an insurers
losses in excess of the insurers applicable deductible the insurers
deductible is based on a percent of earned premium for covered lines of
commercial property and casualty insurance for 2003 the deductible is 7 of
2002 premium for 2004 it is 10 of 2003 premium and for 2005 it is 15 of 2004
premium based on our 2003 earned premiums our deductible under tria during
2004 will be 277 million based on our estimated earned premiums for 2004 our
deductible under tria during 2005 will increase to approximately 500 million
tria limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a
program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not
liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap

competition

         the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are
competitive with over 2000 insurance companies transacting business in the
united states we compete directly with a large number of these companies our
strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or
geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive
advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions each of our
subsidiaries establishes its own pricing practices such practices are based
upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the general intent of
making an underwriting profit competition in the industry generally changes
with profitability

         competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from
other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies
and reinsurers under certain market conditions standard carriers also compete
for excess and surplus business

         competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and
foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or
through the broker market these competitors include berkshire hathaway
employers reinsurance transatlantic reinsurance and everest reinsurance which
collectively comprise a majority of the property casualty reinsurance market in
the united states

         the regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and
other regional stock companies as well as national carriers direct writers of
property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing
insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower cost than
through independent agents such as those used by the company

         the international operations compete with native insurance operations
both large and small which may be related to government entities as well as
with branch or local subsidiaries of multinational companies

employees

         as of march 5 2004 we employed 4669 persons of this number our
subsidiaries employed 4611 persons of whom 2459 were executive and
administrative personnel and 2152 were clerical personnel we employed the
remaining 58 persons at the parent company and in investment operations of whom
43 were executive and administrative personnel and 15 were clerical personnel

other information about the companys business

         we maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of complementary
businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an
ongoing basis in addition the insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or
lines of business to meet the needs of insureds

         seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and
frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries
although the effect on our business of such catastrophes as tornadoes
hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by
reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of
any one or more reporting periods

         we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our
consolidated revenues

         compliance by w r berkley and its subsidiaries with federal state
and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge
of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the
environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures

certain factors that may affect future results

         our business faces significant risks if any of the events or
circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our business results of
operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected

risks relating to our industry

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical
changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry

         the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry
historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties
the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions
while the supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity the
adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of
claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters
regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of
coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due
for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return may impact
policy rates these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate
profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its
costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are
reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact
on our results of operations and financial condition

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require
us to establish additional reserves

         our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 42
billion as of december 31 2003 our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of
the cost of settling all claims and related expenses with respect to insured
events that have occurred

         reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather
reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate
settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred
whether known or unknown the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence
patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation these estimates which
generally involve actuarial projections are based on managements assessment of
facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in
claims severity and frequency inflation judicial theories of liability
reinsurance coverage legislative changes and other factors including the
actions of third parties which are beyond our control

         the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for
certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a
definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached in
periods with increased economic volatility it becomes more difficult to
accurately predict claim costs reserve estimates are continually refined in an
ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and
settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in
which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently
uncertain we cannot assure you that our current reserves will prove adequate in
light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our pretax
income for the period would decrease by a corresponding amount

         we increased our estimates for claims occurring in prior years by 273
million 2003 174 million in 2002 and 211 million in 2001 we along with the
property casualty insurance industry in general have experienced higher than
expected losses for certain types of business written from 1998 to 2001
although our reserves reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims
we cannot assure you that our claim estimates will not need to be increased in
the future

         we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation
business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid
discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to
income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities the expected loss
and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss
payout experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance
companies writing similar business changes in the loss and loss expense payout
pattern are recorded in the period they are determined if the actual loss
payout pattern is shorter than anticipated the discount will be reduced and
pretax income will decrease by a corresponding amount

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade
catastrophes

         property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of
catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations
liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant
impact on our results for example weatherrelated losses for our regional
business were 55 million in 2001 29 million in 2002 and 38 million in 2003
in addition through our recent quota share arrangements with certain lloyds
syndicates we have additional exposure to catastrophic losses

         catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes
windstorms earthquakes hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and
fires as well as terrorist activities the incidence and severity of
catastrophes are inherently unpredictable the extent of losses from a
catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the
area affected by the event and the severity of the event some catastrophes are
restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes and earthquakes may
produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can
cause losses in a variety of our property casualty lines and most of our past
catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather
variations may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance
companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred
it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic
events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which may reduce
premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at attractive rates

         we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines
of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and
nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual
companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified
financial services companies competition in our businesses is based on many
factors including the perceived financial strength of the company premium
charges other terms and conditions offered services provided ratings assigned
by independent rating agencies speed of claims payment and reputation and
experience in the lines to be written

         some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have
greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within
the reinsurance segment include berkshire hathaway employers reinsurance
transatlantic reinsurance and everest reinsurance company which collectively
comprise a majority of the us property casualty reinsurance market we expect
that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as
customers seek high quality reinsurers

         new competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or
reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at
attractive rates

we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts

         to the extent that reinsurers have excluded coverage for terrorist acts
or have priced such coverage at rates that we believe are not practical we in
our capacity as a primary insurer do not have reinsurance protection and are
exposed for potential losses as a result of any terrorist acts for example our
losses from the world trade center attack in 2001 were 35 million

         to the extent an act of terrorism is certified by the secretary of
treasury we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002
tria for up to 90 of our losses however any such coverage would be
subject to a mandatory deductible based on a percent of earned premium for the
covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance based on our 2003
earned premiums our deductible under tria during 2004 will be 277 million
based on our estimated earned premiums for 2004 our deductible under tria
during 2005 will increase to approximately 500 million if tria is not extended
beyond its stated termination date of december 31 2005 or replaced by a similar
program our liability for terrorist acts could be a material amount in
addition even this coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance
that we write

                                       21

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs
and could restrict the conduct of our business

         we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of
policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors this system of
regulation generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in
which we do business relates to among other things

                 standards of solvency including riskbased capital
                  measurements

                 restrictions on the nature quality and concentration of
                  investments

                 requiring certain methods of accounting

                 rate and form regulation pertaining to certain of our
                  insurance businesses and

                 potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for
                  the settlement of covered claims under certain policies
                  provided by impaired insolvent or failed insurance companies

         state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the
affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other
reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding
company issues and other matters recently adopted federal financial services
modernization legislation may lead to additional federal regulation of the
insurance industry in the coming years also foreign governments regulate our
international operations

         we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and
our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and
regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and
regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion
to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the
requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory
requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily
suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize
us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether
federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or
interpretations by regulatory authorities restrict the conduct of our business

         in certain of our insurance businesses the rates we charge our
policyholders are subject to regulatory approval certain lines of business are
subject to a greater degree of regulatory scrutiny then others for example the
workers compensation business is highly regulated during 2003 approximately
12 of our net premiums written represented primary workers compensation
business of our net premiums written approximately 4 represented primary
workers compensation business written in the state of california which is
undergoing workers compensation reform that may adversely affect our ability to
adjust rates

risks relating to our business

our earnings could be more volatile especially since we have increased and
expect to further substantially increase our level of retention in our
business

         we have increased our retention levels due to changes in market
conditions and the pricing environment we plan to purchase less reinsurance
the process by which we transfer or cede part of the risk we have assumed to a
reinsurance company thereby retaining more risk as a result our earnings
could be more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a
significant change in our retention levels could also cause our historical
financial results including compound annual growth rates to be inaccurate
indicators of our future performance on a segment or consolidated basis

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all
and as a result we could experience losses

         we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have
assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the
premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the
reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the
reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our
policyholders or in cases where we are a reinsurer to our reinsureds our
reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they
may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis as of december 31 2003 the
amount due from our reinsurers was 805 million

                                       22
page

including amounts due from state funds and industry pools certain of these
amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or held in trust on
our behalf accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and
if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely
affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers
may affect their future ability to pay claims

we are rated by am best and standard  poors and a decline in these ratings
could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and
earnings to decrease

         ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing
the competitive position of insurance companies certain of our insurance
company subsidiaries are rated by am best standard  poors and moodys
investors services am best standard  poors and moodys ratings reflect
their opinions of an insurance companys financial strength operating
performance strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to
policyholders are not evaluations directed to investors and are not
recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our ratings are subject to
periodic review and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain those
ratings all of the domestic insurance subsidiaries except admiral insurance
company have an am best company inc am best rating of a excellent
which is the third highest rating out of 15 possible ratings by a m best
admiral insurance company has a rating of a superior which is am bests
second highest rating w r berkley insurance europe limited has a rating of
a excellent which is am bests fourth highest rating the standard 
poors financial strength rating for our insurance subsidiaries is anegative
the seventh highest rating out of twentyseven possible ratings our moodys
rating is a2 for berkley insurance company the sixth highest rating out of
twentyone possible ratings

         if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best
standard  poors andor moodys our competitive position in the insurance
industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our
products a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business
as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial
strength ratings

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may
be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting
commitments

         as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we
purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance
company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks we also purchase reinsurance
on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our
control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we
purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our
reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal we may be unable
to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other reinsurance
facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates if we are unable to renew
our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities either our net
exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net
exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments
especially catastrophe exposed risks

our international operations expose us to investment political and economic
risks

         our international operations including our recent ukbased operations
expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign
currency and credit risk changes in the value of the us dollar relative to
other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition for example argentina has recently experienced substantial
political and economic problems including the devaluation of the argentinean
peso as a result we recorded a charge of 18 million in 2001 and 10 million
in 2002 to recognize other than temporary impairment of our investment in
argentine bonds

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and
even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or
successfully invest in such ventures

         as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible
acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an
ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with
respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we
will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance
ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable
terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful the
process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures
may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition

risks relating to our investments

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is
subject to market fluctuations

         our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income
securities as of december 31 2003 our investment in fixed income securities
was approximately 43 billion or 66 of our total investment portfolio

         the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from
these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions the
fair market value of fixed income securities generally decreases as interest
rates rise conversely if interest rates decline investment income earned from
future investments in fixed income securities will be lower in addition some
fixed income securities such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked
securities carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations
based upon the composition and duration of our investment portfolio at december
31 2003 a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a
decrease in the fair value of our investments of approximately 203 million

         the value of investments in fixed income securities and particularly
our investments in highyield securities is subject to impairment as a result
of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer although we attempt to
manage this risk by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of
principal our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general
decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we
invest as well as risks inherent in particular securities for example we
reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the value of our
fixed income investments of 27 million in 2001 16 million in 2002 and
430000 in 2003

we invest some of our assets in equity securities including merger arbitrage
investments and real estate securities which may decline in value

         we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities
including merger arbitrage investments at december 31 2003 our investments in
equity securities was approximately 759 million or 12 of our investment
portfolio although we did not report any provisions for other than temporary
impairments in the value of our equity securities in 2000 or in 2003 we
reported such provisions in the amounts of 01 million in 2001 and 27 million
in 2002

         nearly half our equity securities are invested in merger and
convertible arbitrage trading merger arbitrage is the business of investing in
the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced
tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of
investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring
about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months
or less while our merger arbitrage positions are generally hedged against
market declines these equity investments are exposed primarily to the risk
associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to
regulatory as well as political and other risks as a result of the reduced
activity in the merger and acquisitions area we may not be able achieve the
returns that we have enjoyed in the past

         included in our equity security portfolio are investments in publicly
traded real estate investment trusts reits and private real estate
investment funds and limited partnerships at december 31 2003 our investments
in these securities was approximately 254 million or 4 of our investment
portfolio the values of our real estate investments are subject to fluctuations
based on changes in the economy in general and real estate valuations in
particular in addition the real estate investment funds and limited
partnerships in which we invest are less liquid than our other investments

company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company
subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on
outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and
corporate expenses for example during 2000 and 2001 we received approximately
445 million and 72 million of dividends respectively from our insurance
subsidiaries we elected not to take any dividends from our insurance
subsidiaries in 2002 and 2003

         the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is
subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future
earnings of these subsidiaries as well as the regulatory restrictions during
2004 the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without regulatory
approval is approximately 197 million as a result in the future we may not be
able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts
necessary to meet our obligations or pay dividends

delaying or preventing third party takeovers which may prevent our shareholders
from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover and
make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management

         provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as
our rights agreement and state insurance statutes may hinder delay or prevent
unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control these provisions may also
have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the
replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of
directors

these provisions include

                 our classified board of directors and the ability of our board
                  to increase its size and to appoint directors to fill newly
                  created directorships

                 the requirement that 80 of our stockholders must approve
                  mergers and other transactions between us and the holder of 5
                  or more of our shares unless the transaction was approved by
                  our board of directors prior to such holders acquisition of
                  5 of our shares

                 the need for advance notice in order to raise business or make
                  nominations at stockholders meetings

                 our rights agreement which subject persons other than william
                  r berkley who acquire beneficial ownership of 15 or more of
                  our common stock without board approval to substantial
                  dilution and

                 state insurance statutes that restrict the acquisition of

up to 65 million to berkley international in exchange for a 65 membership interest and nml agreed to contribute up to 35 million to berkley international in exchange for a 35 membership interest applying the same approach that we take for our domestic businesses we believe that decentralized control is key to the success of our international effort for example we hire local insurance executives who have specialized knowledge of their customers markets and products and we link their compensation to meeting performance objectives international operations are conducted in argentina and the philippines in argentina we currently offer commercial and personal property casualty insurance our argentine subsidiary ceased writing life insurance business in 2002 and began a process of liquidating its life insurance inforce in the philippines we provide savings and life products to customers including endowment policies to prefund education costs and retirement income the following table set forth the percentages of direct premiums for our international operations  discontinued business in the third quarter of 2001 the company discontinued its personal lines business both homeowners and private passenger automobile and the alternative markets division of its reinsurance segment by not renewing existing policies or treaties and ceasing to write new business the following table set forth the percentages of premiums for our discontinued business  recent developments in march 2003 the company announced that it intends to form a united kingdom authorized

maturing debt 10 results by industry segment summary financial information about our operating segments is presented on a gaap basis in the following table all amounts include realized capital gains and losses  11 the table below represents summary underwriting ratios on a gaap accounting basis for our insurance companies and the insurance industry the combined ratio represents a measure of underwriting profitability excluding investment income a number in excess of 100 indicates an underwriting loss a number below 100 indicates an underwriting profit  12 investments investment results before income tax effects were as follows   the percentages of the fixed maturity portfolio categorized by contractual maturity based on fair value on the dates indicated are set forth below actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in the property casualty insurance industry it is not unusual for significant periods of time to elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the report of the loss to the insurer and the insurer’s payment of that loss to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses insurers establish reserves which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred our loss reserves reflect current estimates of the ultimate cost of closing outstanding claims other than our excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business as discussed below we do not discount our reserves for financial reporting purposes in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on an aggregate basis which provide for losses incurred but not yet reported to the insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves the estimated expenses of settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process “lae” and a provision for potentially uncollectible reinsurance in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered including historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future events reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using data currently available as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments are revised this may result in increases or decreases to reserves for insured 13 events of prior years the reserving process implicitly recognizes the impact of inflation and other factors affecting loss costs by taking into account changes in historical claim patterns and perceived trends there is no precise method to evaluate the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because the ultimate cost of closing claims is influenced by numerous factors while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to fluctuation in particular high levels of jury verdicts against insurers as well as judicial decisions which “reformulate” policies to expand coverage to include previously unforeseen theories of liability eg those regarding pollution other environmental exposures or manmade catastrophes have produced unanticipated claims and increased the difficulty of estimating the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves we discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company’s loss payout experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies writing similar business the liabilities for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve for nonproportional business and at the statutory rate for proportional business the discount rates range from 39 to 65 with a weighted average rate of 53 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance is 293000000 243000000 and 223000000 at december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations environmental claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which are subject to significant environmental exposures our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 28509000 and 24794000 at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively the company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were 47637000 and 43405000 at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively net incurred losses and loss expenses recoveries for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 6652000 4503000 and 1602000 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively net paid losses and loss expenses receivables for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately 2938000 125000 and 3123000 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential affect of significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain the following table sets forth the components of our gross loss reserves and net provision for losses and loss expense amounts in thousands  14 the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending property casualty reserves on a gross of reinsurance basis amounts in thousands 1  a reconciliation as of december 31 2002 between the reserves reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles “sap” is as follows amounts in thousands   the following table presents the development of net reserves for 1992 through 2002 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to us the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years the “cumulative redundancy deficiency” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1992 reserves have developed a 162 million redundancy over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in 1992 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 1992 assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2002 to 2300 and was settled for 2300 in 2002 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 1992 through 2001 15  16 reinsurance we follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of “a excellent” or better with 500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of “aexcellent” or better with 250 million in policyholder surplus as a result of the attacks of september 11 many reinsurers have significantly changed their underwriting guidelines and limit or no longer provide terrorism coverage see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations” and note 10 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” regulation our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business they are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of policy forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses and requirements regarding numerous other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than es and reinsurance subsidiaries must file all rates for personal and commercial insurance with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our es and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain regulatory approval of the purchase under florida law which is applicable to us due to our ownership of carolina casualty insurance company a florida domiciled insurer the acquisition of more than 5 of our capital stock must receive regulatory approval further state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect their solvency see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” various state and federal organizations including congressional committees and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have been conducting reviews into various aspects of the insurance business the naic codified statutory accounting practices for certain insurance enterprises effective january 1 2001 no assurance can be given that future legislative or regulatory changes resulting from such activity will not adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries the naic utilizes a risk based capital rbc formula which is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset premium and reserve items the rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized control level rbc as of december 31 2002 17 the grammleachbliley act or financial services modernization act of 1999 the “act” was enacted in 1999 and significantly affects the financial services industry including insurance companies banks and securities firms the act modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding companies “fhcs” which as regulated by the act can maintain crossholdings in insurance companies banks and securities firms to an extent not previously allowed the act also permits or facilitates certain types of combinations or affiliations for fhcs the act establishes a functional regulatory scheme under which state insurance departments will maintain primary regulation over insurance activities subject to provisions for certain federal preemptions it is not anticipated that the insurance regulatory aspects of the act will have a material effect on our operations our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in that jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business we receive funds from our insurance subsidiaries in the form of dividends and fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 “tria” became effective november 26 2002 tria establishes a temporary federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism the program terminates on december 31 2005 tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism under the program the federal government will pay 90 of an insurer’s losses in excess of the insurer’s applicable deductible the insurer’s deductible is based on a percent of earned premium for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance for 2003 the deductible is 7 of 2002 premium for 2004 it is 10 of 2003 premium and for 2005 it is 15 of 2004 premium tria limits the federal governments share of losses at 100 billion for a program year in addition an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap competition the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are competitive with over 2000 insurance companies transacting business in the united states we compete directly with a large number of these companies our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions each of our subsidiaries establishes its own pricing practices such practices are based upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the general intent of making an underwriting profit competition in the industry generally changes with profitability competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies and reinsurers under certain market conditions standard carriers also compete for es business competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market these competitors include berkshire hathaway employers reinsurance transatlantic reinsurance and 18 everest reinsurance which collectively comprise a majority of the property casualty reinsurance market in the united states the regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company the international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small which may be related to government entities as well as with branch or local subsidiaries of multinational companies employees as of march 8 2003 we employed 4359 persons of this number our subsidiaries employed 4305 persons of whom 2012 were executive and administrative personnel and 2293 were clerical personnel we employed the remaining 54 persons at the parent company and in investment operations of whom 42 were executive and administrative personnel and 12 were clerical personnel other information about the company’s business we maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis in addition the insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries although the effect on our business of such catastrophes as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues compliance by w r berkley and its subsidiaries with federal state and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position the company’s

faces significant risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions while the supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return may impact policy rates these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require us to establish additional reserves we maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses including legal and other fees as well as a portion of our general expenses for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost these estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors in some cases longtail lines of business such as excess workers’ compensation and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business are reserved on a discounted basis the variables described above are affected by both internal and external events such as changes in claims handling procedures inflation judicial and litigation trends and legislative changes the risk of the occurrence of such events is especially present in our specialty and reinsurance businesses as well as our discontinued alternative markets reinsurance business many of these items are not directly quantifiable in advance in some areas of our business the level of reserves we establish is dependent in part upon the actions of third parties that are beyond our control in our reinsurance and excess workers’ compensation businesses we may not establish sufficient reserves if third parties do not give us advance notice or provide us with appropriate information regarding certain matters additionally there may be a significant delay between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is reported to us the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where the various considerations affecting these types of claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made for example there are greater uncertainties involved with establishing reserves relating to the world trade center attack the enron bankruptcy and asbestos and environmental claims reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure you that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we need to increase our reserves our net income for the period will decrease by a corresponding amount our earnings could be more volatile especially since we have increased and may further increase our level of retention in our business we increased our retention levels in 2001 and 2002 due to changes in market conditions and the pricing environment we purchased less reinsurance the process by which we transfer or cede part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company thereby retaining more risk we may further increase our retention levels in the future as a result our earnings 20 could be more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a significant change in our retention levels could also cause our historical financial results including compound annual growth rates to be inaccurate indicators of our future performance on a segment or consolidated basis as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade catastrophes property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and fires as well as terrorist activities the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable for example during the five years ended december 31 2002 our losses from natural and manmade catastrophes ranged from xx million to xx million the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather variations may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce unforeseen losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which may reduce premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at attractive rates we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies competition in our businesses is based on many factors including the perceived financial strength of the company premium charges other terms and conditions offered services provided ratings assigned by independent rating agencies speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within the reinsurance segment include employers reinsurance berkshire hathaway and american reinsurance which collectively comprise a majority of the property casualty reinsurance market we expect that perceived financial strength in particular will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers new competition could cause the supply andor demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our underwriting results if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase reinsurance for significant amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially catastrophe exposed risks we as a primary insurer may have significant exposure for terrorist acts to the extent that reinsurers have excluded coverage for terrorist acts or have priced such coverage at rates that we believe are not practical we in our capacity as a primary insurer do not have reinsurance protection and are exposed for potential losses as a result 21 of any terrorist acts to the extent an act of terrorism certified by the secretary of the treasury under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002“tria” our mandatory deductible under tria could be a material amount we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all and as a result we could experience losses we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our policyholders or in cases where we are a reinsurer to our reinsureds our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our financial results would be adversely affected underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims we invest some of our assets in alternative investments which is subject to certain risks we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in alternative investments which is primarily merger arbitrage merger arbitrage is the business of investing in the securities of publicly held companies which are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less while our merger arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines these equity investments are exposed primarily to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks as a result of the reduced activity in the merger and acquisitions area we may not be able achieve the returns that we have enjoyed in the past alternative investments also include investments in highyield bonds and real estate investment trusts a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is subject to market fluctuations our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income securities the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions with respect to our investments in fixed income securities the fair market value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates in addition actual net investment income andor cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations further the value of any particular fixed income security is subject to impairment based on the credit worthiness of a given issuer because substantially all of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale changes in the market value of our securities are reflected in our balance sheet similar treatment is not available for liabilities therefore interest rate fluctuations affect the value of our investments and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our operations in argentina and the philippines expose us to investment political and economic risks our operations in argentina and the philippines expose us to investment political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and either the argentine or philippine peso could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition argentina has experienced substantial political and economic problems it is likely that there will be further changes to argentine economic and monetary policies in the future these changes may result in further impairment in value of argentine bonds and a decline in investment income as a result of lower interest on bonds we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders 22 and other investors this system of regulation generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business relates to among other things  state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation is expected to lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years also foreign governments regulate our international operations we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities restrict the conduct of our business the growing number of insolvencies in the insurance industry increases the possibility that we will be assessed pursuant to various state guaranty fund requirements we are rated by am best and standard  poor’s and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best and certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated for their claimspaying ability by standard  poor’s corporation or standard  poor’s am best and standard  poor’s ratings reflect their opinions of an insurance company’s financial strength operating performance strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders are not evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our ratings are subject to periodic review by am best and standard  poor’s and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain those ratings our am best rating is a superior for admiral insurance company and a excellent for our other insurance companies rated by a m best the standard  poor’s financial strength rating for our insurance subsidiaries is anegative if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best andor standard  poor’s our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial strength ratings we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries as well as the regulatory restrictions as a result we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations or pay dividends 23 we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees we depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets

                             reinsurance operations

      our reinsurance operations consist of four operating units which
specialize in underwriting property casualty reinsurance on both a treaty and a
facultative basis

      treaty our property casualty treaty division is our largest reinsurance
unit in terms of personnel and premiums written this division is committed
exclusively to the broker market segment of the treaty reinsurance industry it
functions as a traditional reinsurer in specialty and standard reinsurance
lines

      in 2001 we continued to focus on reinsurance lines of business which are
more specialty focused and where knowledge and expertise in a specific area is
valued over the capital scale of the reinsurance provider it is in those
situations where we can best utilize our intellectual capital to drive the
underwriting process we also continued redirecting our treaty business toward
casualty excess of loss treaties these changes have allowed and will continue
to allow us to have more significant participations and greater influence over
the terms and conditions of coverage

      facultative our facultative division specializes in individual
certificate and program facultative business its highly experienced
underwriters seek to offset the underwriting and pricing cycles in the
underlying insurance business by developing risk management solutions and
through superior risk selection we develop this business through brokers and on
a direct basis where the client does not choose to use an intermediary the
facultative division also writes excess and surplus lines through its affiliate
vela insurance services inc

      fidelity and surety our fidelity and surety division operates as a lead
reinsurer in a niche market of the property casualty industry where its highly
specialized knowledge and expertise are essential to assess the needs of
fidelity and surety primary writers business is marketed principally through
brokers as well as directly to clients not served by intermediaries commencing
january 1 2002 we ceased writing business with exposures to large national
risks and will focus primarily on our regional surety reinsurance business

      program business our program business division oversees managing general
underwriting mgu program business most recently through berkley underwriting
partners llc

                            international operations

      in 1995 the company and northwestern mutual life international inc
nml a whollyowned subsidiary of the northwestern mutual life insurance
company entered into a joint venture to form berkley international llc
berkley international a limited liability company we agreed to contribute
up to 65 million to berkley international in exchange for a 65 membership
interest and nml agreed to contribute up to 35 million to berkley international
in exchange for a 35 membership interest

      applying the same approach that we take for our domestic businesses we
believe that decentralized control is key to the success of our international
effort for example we hire local insurance executives who have specialized
knowledge of their customers markets and products and we link their
compensation to meeting performance objectives

      international operations are conducted in argentina and the philippines
in argentina we offer commercial and personal property casualty insurance our
argentine business has also issued both universal life insurance and long
duration contracts that because of recent economic developments in argentina
are subject to greater investment political and economic risks see certain
factors that may affect future results in the philippines we provide savings
and life products to customers including endowment policies to prefund
education costs and retirement income

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves

      in the property casualty insurance industry it is not unusual for
significant periods of time to elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss
the report of the loss to the insurer and the insurers payment of that loss to
recognize liabilities for unpaid losses insurers establish reserves which is a
balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay
claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred
our loss reserves reflect current estimates of the ultimate cost of closing
outstanding claims other than our excess workers compensation business and the
workers compensation portion of our reinsurance business as discussed below
we do not discount our reserves for financial reporting purposes

      in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a case
reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment the estimate
represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and
reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the
nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on
an aggregate basis which provide for losses incurred but not yet reported to the
insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves the estimated expenses of
settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of
administering the claims adjustment process lae and a provision for
potentially uncollectible reinsurance

      in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered including
historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and economic
conditions including the effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on
the basic assumption that past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects
of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for
predicting future events reserve amounts are necessarily based on managements
informed estimates and judgments using data currently available as additional
experience and other data become available and are reviewed these estimates and
judgments are revised this may result in increases or decreases to reserves for
insured

events of prior years the reserving process implicitly recognizes the impact of
inflation and other factors affecting loss costs by taking into account changes
in historical claim patterns and perceived trends there is no precise method to
evaluate the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because
the ultimate cost of closing claims is influenced by numerous factors

      while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time
some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are
subject to fluctuation in particular high levels of jury verdicts against
insurers as well as judicial decisions which reformulate policies to expand
coverage to include previously unforeseen theories of liability eg those
regarding pollution other environmental exposures or manmade catastrophes
have produced unanticipated claims and increased the difficulty of estimating
the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves

      we discount our liabilities for excess workers compensation business and
the workers compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the
long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to
appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment
securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense
payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the companys loss payout
experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies
writing similar business the liabilities for losses and loss expenses have been
discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us
treasury yield curve for nonproportional business and at the statutory rate
for proportional business the discount rates range from 43 to 65 with a
weighted average rate of 55 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the
effects of ceded reinsurance is 243000000 223000000 and 196000000 at
december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

      to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company
subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations environmental
claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did
not insure the larger industrial companies which are subject to significant
environmental exposures

      our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to
asbestos and environmental claims were 24794000 and 29422000 at december
31 2001 and 2000 respectively the companys gross reserves for losses and
loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were
43405000 and 57167000 at december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively net
incurred losses and loss expenses recoveries for reported asbestos and
environmental claims were approximately 4503000 1602000 and 1371000
in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively net paid losses and loss expenses
receivables for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately
125000 3123000 and 3819000 in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the
estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal
variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial
estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted
actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential affect of
significant unresolved legal matters including coverage issues as well as the
cost of litigating the legal issues additionally the determination of ultimate
damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible
parties are highly uncertain

1   claims occurring during the current year is net of discount of
      24781000 39990000 and 22923754 for the years ended december 31
      2001 2000 and 1999 respectively
2   for statutory purposes we use a discount rate of 43 as permitted by the
      department of insurance of the state of delaware

      the following table presents the development of net reserves for 1991
through 2001 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid
losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the
indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss
expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance
sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to us
the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously
recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the
estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and
severity of claims for individual years

      the cumulative redundancy deficiency represents the aggregate change
in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1991 reserves have
developed a 140 million redundancy over ten years that amount has been
reflected in income over the ten years the impact on the results of operations
of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the
reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a run
off of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss
development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes
in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in
1991 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 1991 assuming this claim was
settled for 2300 in 2001 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in
each year from 1991 through 2000

reinsurance

      we follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our
exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the
policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net
liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses
although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary
liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming
reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we
monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our
coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result
generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am
best rating of a excellent or better with 250 million in policyholder
surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am
best rating of aexcellent or better with 150 million in policyholder
surplus as a result of the attacks of september 11 many reinsurers have
significantly changed their underwriting guidelines and limit or no longer
provide terrorism coverage see managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and result of operations and note 9 of notes to
consolidated financial statements

regulation

      our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation
and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business they are subject
to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to
state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the
standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of
insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments
deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of policy
forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance
companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial
condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of
reserves for unearned premiums and losses and requirements regarding numerous
other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than es and
reinsurance subsidiaries must file all rates for personal and commercial
insurance with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our
es and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form
regulation

      in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we
are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems
typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the
state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital
structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under
the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to
purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding
voting securities would be required to obtain regulatory approval of the
purchase under florida law which is applicable to us due to our ownership of
carolina casualty insurance company a florida domiciled insurer the
acquisition of more than 5 of our capital stock must receive regulatory
approval further state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the
amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in
order to protect their solvency see managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources

      various state and federal organizations including congressional
committees and the national association of insurance commissioners naic
have been conducting reviews into various aspects of the insurance business the
naic codified statutory accounting practices for certain insurance enterprises
effective january 1 2001 no assurance can be given that future legislative or
regulatory changes resulting from such activity will not adversely affect our
insurance subsidiaries

      the naic utilizes a risk based capital rbc formula which is designed to
measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks
inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level
of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset
premium and reserve items the rbc model law provides for four incremental
levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the
calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from
requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing
the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance
subsidiaries was above the authorized control level rbc as of december 31 2001

      the grammleachbliley act or financial services modernization act of
1999 the act was enacted in 1999 and significantly affects the financial
services industry including insurance companies banks and securities firms
the act modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding
companies fhcs which as regulated by the act can maintain


                                       17
page

crossholdings in insurance companies banks and securities firms to an extent
not previously allowed the act also permits or facilitates certain types of
combinations or affiliations for fhcs the act establishes a functional
regulatory scheme under which state insurance departments will maintain primary
regulation over insurance activities subject to provisions for certain federal
preemptions

      important provisions of the act involve requirements for adoption of i
multistate agents licensing reforms and uniformity requirements and ii
privacy protections giving the states the ability to enact these laws in the
first instance or be preempted the naic adopted a model regulation on privacy
and a model law on agents licensing which have been enacted or are currently
being considered by various state legislatures and insurance departments it is
not anticipated that the insurance regulatory aspects of the act will have a
material effect on our operations

      our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state
guaranty funds when an insurer in that jurisdiction has been judicially declared
insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to
pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a states
guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to
state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be
members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of
direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which
many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject
premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise
several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance
subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with
regard to deficits in certain lines of business

      we receive funds from our insurance subsidiaries in the form of dividends
and fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess of maximum
amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the
insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is
domiciled

competition

      the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are
competitive with over 2000 insurance companies transacting business in the
united states we compete directly with a large number of these companies our
strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or
geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive
advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions each of our
subsidiaries establishes its own pricing practices such practices are based
upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the general intent of
making an underwriting profit competition in the industry generally changes
with profitability

      competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from
other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies
and reinsurers under certain market conditions standard carriers also compete
for es business

      competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign
reinsurers which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the
broker market these competitors include employers reinsurance berkshire
hathaway and american reinsurance which collectively comprise a majority of
the property casualty reinsurance market in the united states

      the regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and other
regional stock companies as well as national carriers direct writers of
property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing
insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower cost than
through independent agents such as those used by the company

      the international operations compete with native insurance operations both
large and small which may be related to government entities as well as with
branch or local subsidiaries of multinational companies

employees

      as of march 8 2002 we employed 4244 persons of this number our
subsidiaries employed 4194 persons of whom 2175 were executive and
administrative personnel and 2069 were clerical personnel we employed the
remaining 50 persons at the parent company and in investment operations of whom
38 were executive and administrative personnel and 12 were clerical personnel

other information about the companys business

      we maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of complementary
businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an
ongoing basis in addition the insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or
lines of business to meet the needs of insureds

      seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and
frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries
although the effect on our business of such catastrophes as tornadoes
hurricanes hailstorms earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by
reinsurance they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of
any one or more reporting periods

      we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our
consolidated revenues

      compliance by w r berkley and its subsidiaries with federal state and
local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the
environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures
earnings or competitive position

                 certain factors that may affect future results

      our business faces significant risks the risks described below may not be
the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we
currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations if any
of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our
business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and
adversely affected

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical
changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry

      the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry
historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties
the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions
while the supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity the
adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of
claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters
regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of
coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due
for injuries or losses in addition investment rates of return may impact
policy rates these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate
profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its
costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are
reported these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact
on our results of operations and financial condition

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims which may require
us to establish additional reserves

      we maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for unpaid
losses and loss adjustment expenses including legal and other fees as well as a
portion of our general expenses for reported and unreported claims incurred as
of the end of each accounting period reserves do not represent an exact
calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what we
expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost these
estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on our
assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future
trends in claims severity frequency judicial theories of liability and other
factors in some cases longtail lines of business such as excess workers
compensation and the workers compensation portion of our reinsurance business
are reserved on a discounted basis the variables described above are affected
by both internal and external events such as changes in claims handling
procedures inflation judicial and litigation trends and legislative changes

      the risk of the occurrence of such events is especially present in our
specialty and reinsurance businesses as well as our discontinued alternative
markets reinsurance business many of these items are not directly quantifiable
in advance in some areas of our business the level of reserves we establish is
dependent in part upon the actions of third parties that are beyond our control
in our reinsurance and excess workers compensation businesses we may not
establish sufficient reserves if third parties do not give us advance notice or
provide us with appropriate information regarding certain matters additionally
there may be a significant delay between the occurrence of the insured event and
the time it is reported to us

      the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain
types of liabilities where the various considerations affecting these types of
claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before a
definitive determination of liability is made for example there are greater
uncertainties involved with establishing reserves relating to the world trade
center attack the enron bankruptcy and asbestos and environmental claims
reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience
develops and further claims are reported and settled adjustments to reserves
are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed
because setting reserves is inherently uncertain we cannot assure you that our
current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events should we
need to increase our reserves our net income for the period will decrease by a
corresponding amount

our earnings could be more volatile especially since we have increased and may
further increase our level of retention in our business

      we increased our retention levels in 2000 and 2001 due to changes in
market conditions and the pricing environment we purchased less reinsurance
the process by which we transfer or cede part of the risk we have assumed to a
reinsurance company thereby retaining more risk we may further increase our
retention levels in the future as a result our earnings


                                       20
page

could be more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a
significant change in our retention levels could also cause our historical
financial results including compound annual growth rates to be inaccurate
indicators of our future performance on a segment or consolidated basis

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from natural and manmade
catastrophes

      property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of
catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations
liquidity and financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant
impact on our results catastrophes can be caused by various events including
hurricanes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms explosions severe winter
weather and fires as well as terrorist activities the incidence and severity
of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable for example during the five years
ended december 31 2001 our losses from natural and manmade catastrophes
ranged from 33 million to 96 million the extent of losses from a catastrophe
is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected
by the event and the severity of the event most catastrophes are restricted to
small geographic areas however hurricanes and earthquakes may produce
significant damage in large heavily populated areas catastrophes can cause
losses in a variety of our property casualty lines and most of our past
catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms seasonal weather
variations may affect the severity and frequency of our losses insurance
companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred
it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic
events could produce unforeseen losses and have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses which may reduce
premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at attractive rates

      we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of
business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus
insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies
specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial
services companies competition in our businesses is based on many factors
including the perceived financial strength of the company premium charges
other terms and conditions offered services provided ratings assigned by
independent rating agencies speed of claims payment and reputation and
experience in the lines to be written

      some of our competitors particularly in the reinsurance business have
greater financial and marketing resources than we do these competitors within
the reinsurance segment include employers reinsurance berkshire hathaway and
american reinsurance which collectively comprise a majority of the property
casualty reinsurance market we expect that perceived financial strength in
particular will become more important as customers seek high quality
reinsurers

      a number of new proposed or potential legislative or industry
developments could further increase competition in our industry these
developments include

                 an increase in capitalraising by companies in our lines of
                  business which could result in new entrants to our markets
                  and an excess of capital in the industry

                 the enactment of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 which
                  could result in increased competition from new entrants to our
                  markets

                 the implementation of commercial lines deregulation in several
                  states which could increase competition from standard
                  carriers for our excess and surplus lines of insurance
                  business

                 programs in which statesponsored entities provide property
                  insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative
                  markets types of coverage and

                 changing practices caused by the internet which may lead to
                  greater competition in the insurance business

      new competition from these developments could cause the supply andor
demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could affect our ability to
price our products at attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our
underwriting results

if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable we may
be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting
commitments

      as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy we purchase
reinsurance for significant amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance
company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks we also purchase reinsurance
on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure market conditions beyond our
control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we
purchase which may affect the level of our business and profitability our
reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal we may be unable
to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other reinsurance
facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates if we are unable to renew
our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities either our net
exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net
exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments
especially catastrophe exposed risks as a result of the attacks of september
11 2001 and reinsurance market conditions we anticipate further price
increases for reinsurance we purchase beginning in 2002

we as a primary insurer may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage for
terrorist acts

      it is difficult to determine the full impact of the attacks of september
11 2001 on coverage terms with respect to future acts of terrorism both on the
primary and reinsurance levels to the extent that reinsurers are able to and do
exclude coverage for terrorist acts or price such coverage at a rate at which it
is not practical for primary insurers to obtain such coverage primary insurers
might not be able to likewise exclude terrorist acts because of regulatory
constraints if this does occur we in our capacity as a primary insurer would
not have certain reinsurance protection and would be exposed for potential
losses as a result of any terrorist acts

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all
and as a result we could experience losses

      we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have
assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the
premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the
reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the
reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our
policyholders or in cases where we are a reinsurer to our reinsureds our
reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they
may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis accordingly we bear credit
risk with respect to our reinsurers and if our reinsurers fail to pay us our
financial results would be adversely affected the attacks of september 11 2001
may affect the financial resources of some of our reinsurers

we invest some of our assets in alternative investments which is subject to
certain risks

      we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in alternative investments
which is primarily merger arbitrage as of december 31 2001 our investment in
merger arbitrage securities represented approximately 13 of our total
investment portfolio merger arbitrage is the business of investing in the
securities of publicly held companies which are the targets in announced tender
offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in
its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in
value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less while
our merger arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines
these equity investments are exposed primarily to the risk associated with the
completion of announced deals which are subject to regulatory as well as
political and other risks as a result of the reduced activity in the merger and
acquisitions area we may not be able achieve the returns that we have enjoyed
in the past alternative investments also include investments in highyield
bonds and real estate investment trusts

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is
subject to market fluctuations

      our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income
securities the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from
these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions with
respect to our investments in fixed income securities the fair market value of
these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship
with fluctuations in interest rates while net investment income realized by us
from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or
decrease with interest rates in addition actual net investment income andor
cash flows from


                                       22
page

investments that carry prepayment risk such as mortgagebacked and other
assetbacked securities may differ from those anticipated at the time of
investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations because substantially all
of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale changes in
the market value of our securities are reflected in our balance sheet similar
treatment is not available for liabilities therefore interest rate
fluctuations affect the value of our investments and could adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition

our operations in argentina and the philippines expose us to investment
political and economic risks

      our operations in argentina and the philippines expose us to investment
political and economic risks including foreign currency and credit risk
changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and either the argentine or
philippine peso could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition during 2001 argentina experienced substantial political
and economic problems including high unemployment increasing fiscal deficits
and declining central bank reserves the government responded to these problems
by converting certain public bonds into guaranteed loans with longer maturities
and lower interest rates abandoning the fixed dollartopeso exchange rate and
imposing various currency restrictions it is likely that there will be further
changes to argentine economic and monetary policies in 2002 these changes may
result in further impairment in value of argentine bonds a decline in
investment income as a result of lower interest on bonds and the surrender of
all or substantially all life insurance policiesinforce

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which increases our costs
and could restrict the conduct of our business

      we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision most
insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders
rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation
generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do
business relates to among other things

                 standards of solvency including riskbased capital
                  measurements

                 restrictions on the nature quality and concentration of
                  investments

                 requiring certain methods of accounting

                 requiring reserves for unearned premium losses and other
                  purposes and

                 potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for
                  the settlement of covered claims under certain policies
                  provided by impaired insolvent or failed insurance companies

      state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs
of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports
relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company
issues and other matters recently adopted federal financial services
modernization legislation is expected to lead to additional federal regulation
of the insurance industry in the coming years also foreign governments
regulate our international operations

      we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our
business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and
regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and
regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion
to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not have the
requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory
requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily
suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize
us also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether
federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations themselves or
interpretations by regulatory authorities restrict the conduct of our business
the growing number of insolvencies in the insurance industry increases the
possibility that we will be assessed pursuant to various state guaranty fund
requirements we cannot predict the outcome of proposed federal legislation on
insurance coverage for terrorism including the possibility that we may be
required to contribute to a pool based on certain criteria and the legal and
financial effects that such legislation might have on us and the property
casualty industry

we are rated by am best and standard  poors and a decline in these ratings
could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and
earnings to decrease

      ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the
competitive position of insurance companies our insurance company subsidiaries
are rated by am best and certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are
rated for their claimspaying ability by standard  poors corporation or
standard  poors am best and standard  poors ratings reflect their
opinions of an insurance companys financial strength operating performance
strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders are not
evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy sell or
hold our securities our ratings are subject to periodic review by am best and
standard  poors and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain those
ratings our am best rating is a superior for admiral insurance company and
a excellent for our other insurance companies rated by a m best the
standard  poors financial strengthen rating for our insurance subsidiaries is
anegative if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best
andor standard  poors our competitive position in the insurance industry
could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products a
significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as
policyholders move to other companies with higher claimspaying and financial
strength ratings

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive
dividends in needed amounts

      our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance
company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company
subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on
outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and
corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company
subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the
surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries as well as the regulatory
restrictions as a result we may not be able to receive dividends from these
subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations or pay
dividends

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and
even if we do we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or
successfully invest in such ventures

      as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible
acquisition transactions and the startup of complementary businesses on an
ongoing basis and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with
respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures we cannot assure you that we
will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance
ventures that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable
terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful the
process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures
may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees

      we depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting
talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business if
the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases we may be
unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets
in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets

item 3 legal proceedings

      claims under insurance policies written by our insurance subsidiaries are
investigated and settled either by claims adjusters employed by them by their
independent agents or by


                                       24
page

independent adjusters generally the insurance subsidiary employs a staff of
claims adjusters at its home office and at some regional offices some
independent agents may have the authority to settle small claims independent
claims adjusting firms are used to assist in handling various claims in areas
where insurance volume does not warrant the maintenance of a staff adjuster if
a claim or loss cannot be settled and results in litigation the subsidiary
generally retains outside counsel

      at present neither w r berkley nor any of its subsidiaries is engaged
in litigation known to us which is expected to have a material adverse effect
upon our business as is common with property casualty insurance companies our
subsidiaries are regularly engaged in the defense of claims arising out of the
conduct of the insurance and reinsurance business the company has arbitration
pending pertaining to a surety reinsurance contract coverage issue where it is
the reinsurer the proceeding is in the initial stages and the company believes
it has meritorious defenses with respect to this issue

                             reinsurance operations

         our reinsurance operations consist of three operating units which
specialize in underwriting property casualty and surety reinsurance on both a
treaty and a facultative basis

         treaty our property casualty treaty division is our largest business
unit in terms of personnel and premiums written this division is committed
exclusively to the broker market segment of the treaty reinsurance industry it
functions as a traditional reinsurer in specialty and standard reinsurance
lines

         in 2000 we began to focus on reinsurance lines of business which are
more specialtyfocused and where knowledge and expertise in a specific area is
valued over the capital scale of the reinsurance provider it is in those
situations where we can best utilize our intellectual capital to drive the
underwriting process in the first quarter of 2000 we also began redirecting
our reinsurance business away from the property subsegments which expose us to
weatherrelated and other natural catastrophes and decided to withdraw
altogether from the latin american and caribbean market in addition within the
treaty subsegment we are shifting our focus toward excess of loss treaties
which we believe present more profitable opportunities we anticipate that these
changes will allow us to have more significant participations and greater
influence over the terms and conditions of coverage however due to the shift
in our focus we are expecting a reduction in reinsurance premiums

         facultative our facultative division specializes in individual
certificate and program facultative business its highly experienced
underwriters seek to offset the underwriting and pricing cycles in the
underlying insurance business by developing risk management solutions and
through superior risk selection we develop this business through brokers and on
a direct basis where the client does not choose to use an intermediary

         fidelity and surety our fidelity and surety division operates as a
lead reinsurer in a niche market of the property casualty industry where its
highly specialized knowledge and expertise are essential to meet the needs of
fidelity and surety primary writers business is marketed principally through
brokers as well as directly to clients not served by intermediaries

                            international operations

         in 1995 the company and northwestern mutual life international inc
nml a whollyowned subsidiary of the northwestern mutual life insurance
company entered into a joint venture to form berkley international llc
berkley international a limited liability company we agreed to contribute
up to 65 million to berkley international in exchange for a 65 membership
interest and nml agreed to contribute up to 35 million to berkley international
in exchange for a 35 membership interest

         applying the same approach that we take for our domestic businesses we
believe that decentralized control is key to the success of our international
effort for example we hire local insurance executives who have specialized
knowledge of their customers markets and products and we link their
compensation to meeting performance objectives

         presently international operations are conducted primarily in argentina
and the philippines in argentina we offer customers commercial and personal
property casualty insurance in addition to life insurance and workers
compensation in the philippines we provide savings and life products to
customers including endowment policies to prefund education costs and
retirement income

our international operations

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves

         in the property casualty insurance industry it is not unusual for
significant periods of time to elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss
the report of the loss to the insurer and the insurers payment of that loss to
recognize liabilities for unpaid losses insurers establish reserves which is a
balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay
claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred
our loss reserves reflect current estimates of the ultimate cost of closing
outstanding claims other than our excess workers compensation business and the
workers compensation portion of our reinsurance business as discussed below
we do not discount our reserves for financial reporting purposes

         in general when a claim is reported claims personnel establish a
case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment the estimate
represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and
reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the
nature and value of the specific type of claim reserves are also established on
an aggregate basis which provide for losses incurred but not yet reported to the
insurer potential inadequacy of case reserves the estimated expenses of
settling claims including legal and other fees and general expenses of
administering the claims adjustment process lae and a provision for
potentially uncollectible reinsurance each insurance subsidiarys net retention
for each line of insurance is taken into consideration in the computation of
estimated ultimate losses

         in examining reserve adequacy several factors are considered
including historical data legal developments changes in social attitudes and
economic conditions including the


                                       12
page   13
effects of inflation the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that
past experience adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments
and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future events
reserve amounts are necessarily based on managements informed estimates and
judgments using data currently available as additional experience and other
data become available and are reviewed these estimates and judgments are
revised this may result in increases or decreases to reserves for insured
events of prior years the reserving process implicitly recognizes the impact of
inflation and other factors affecting loss costs by taking into account changes
in historical claim patterns and perceived trends there is no precise method to
evaluate the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because
the ultimate cost of closing claims is influenced by numerous factors

         while the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over
time some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns
are subject to fluctuation in particular high levels of jury verdicts against
insurers as well as judicial decisions which reformulate policies to expand
coverage to include previously unforeseen theories of liability eg those
regarding pollution and other environmental exposures have produced
unanticipated claims and increased the difficulty of estimating the loss and
loss adjustment expense reserves

         we discount our liabilities for excess workers compensation business
and the workers compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the
long period of time over which losses are paid discounting is intended to
appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment
securities supporting the liabilities the expected losses and loss expense
payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the companys loss payout
experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies
writing similar business the liabilities for losses and loss expenses have been
discounted using riskfree discount rates determined by reference to the us
treasury yield curve the discount rates range from 516 to 649 with a
weighted average rate of 585 the aggregate net discount after reflecting the
effects of ceded reinsurance is 223000000 196000000 and 187000000 at
december 31 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively

         to date known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance
company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations
environmental claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries
generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which are subject to
significant environmental exposures

         our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to
asbestos and environmental claims were 29422000 and 30944000 at december
31 2000 and 1999 respectively the companys gross reserves for losses and
loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were
57167000 and 65966000 at december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively net
incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims
were approximately 1602000 1371000 and 2227000 in 2000 1999 and 1998
respectively net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and
environmental claims were approximately 3123000 3819000 and 2614000 in
2000 1999 and 1998 respectively the estimation of these liabilities is
subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because
it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due
to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures
and the potential affect of significant unresolved legal matters including
coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues
additionally the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of
such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain

reserves and net provision for losses and loss expense amounts in thousands

1      claims occurring during the current year is net of discount of
         39990000 22923754 and 20354000 for the years ended december
         31 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively

2      for statutory purposes we use a discount rate of 45 as permitted by
         the department of insurance of the state of delaware for gaap
         purposes we use a discount rate based on the u s treasury yield
         curve weighted for the expected payout period as described above

       the following table presents the development of net reserves for 1990
through 2000 the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid
losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the
indicated years this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss
expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance
sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to us
the upper portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously
recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the
estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and
severity of claims for individual years

         the cumulative redundancy deficiency represents the aggregate
change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1990 reserves
have developed a 141 million redundancy over ten years that amount has been
reflected in income over the ten years the impact on the results of operations
of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the
reconciliation tables above it should be noted that the table presents a run
off of balance sheet reserves rather than accident or policy year loss
development therefore each amount in the table includes the effects of changes
in reserves for all prior years for example assume a claim that occurred in
1990 is reserved for 2000 as of december 31 1990 assuming this claim was
settled for 2300 in 2000 the 300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in
each year from 1990 through 1999

reinsurance

         we follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of
our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the
policies that we write reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net
liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses
although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary
liability for the full amount of the policies it does make the assuming
reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we
monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our
coverages only with substantial financially sound carriers as a result
generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am
best rating of a excellent or better with 250 million in policyholder
surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am
best rating of aexcellent or better with 150 million in policyholder
surplus

regulation

         our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation
and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business they are subject
to statutes which delegate regulatory supervisory and administrative powers to
state insurance commissioners this regulation relates to such matters as the
standards of solvency which must be met and maintained the licensing of
insurers and their agents the nature of and limitations on investments
deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of policy
forms and premium rates periodic examination of the affairs of insurance
companies annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial
condition of insurers or for other purposes establishment and maintenance of
reserves for unearned premiums and losses and requirements regarding numerous
other matters our property casualty subsidiaries other than es and
reinsurance subsidiaries must file all rates for personal and commercial
insurance with the insurance department of each state in which they operate our
es and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form
regulation

         in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries we
are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems
typically such statutes require that we periodically file information with the
state insurance commissioner including information concerning our capital
structure ownership financial condition and general business operations under
the terms of applicable state statutes any person or entity desiring to
purchase more than a specified percentage commonly 10 of our outstanding
voting securities would be required to obtain regulatory approval of the
purchase under florida law which is applicable to us due to our ownership of
carolina casualty insurance company a florida domiciled insurer the
acquisition of more than 5 of our capital stock must receive regulatory
approval further state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the
amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in
order to protect their solvency see managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources

         various state and federal organizations including congressional
committees and the national association of insurance commissioners naic
have been conducting reviews into various aspects of the insurance business the
naic recently completed a process intended to codify statutory accounting
practices for certain insurance enterprises effective january 1 2001 the
accounting codification will not have a material impact on our insurance
subsidiaries results of operations or statutory surplus the naic is also
considering model laws on commercial lines deregulation a number of states have
adopted and others are considering adopting forms of commercial lines
deregulation laws which depending upon factors such as the relatively high
amount of premium or revenue of an insured would permit an insurer to provide
insurance without being subject to rate andor form filing requirements no
assurance can be given that future legislative or regulatory changes resulting
from such activity will not adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries

         the naic utilizes a risk based capital rbc formula which is designed
to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the
risks inherent in its business the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target
level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various
asset premium and reserve items the rbc model law provides for four
incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below
the calculated rbc target these levels of attention range in severity from
requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing
the insurer under regulatory control the rbc of each of our domestic insurance
subsidiaries was above the authorized control level rbc as of december 31 2000

         the grammleachbliley act or financial services modernization act of
1999 the act was enacted in 1999 and significantly affects the financial
services industry including


                                       16
page   17
insurance companies banks and securities firms the act modifies federal law to
permit the creation of financial holding companies fhcs which as regulated
by the act can maintain crossholdings in insurance companies banks and
securities firms to an extent not previously allowed the act also permits or
facilitates certain types of combinations or affiliations for fhcs the act
establishes a functional regulatory scheme under which state insurance
departments will maintain primary regulation over insurance activities subject
to provisions for certain federal preemptions

         important provisions of the act involve requirements for adoption of
i multistate agents licensing reforms and uniformity requirements and ii
privacy protections giving the states the ability to enact these laws in the
first instance or be preempted the naic adopted a model regulation on privacy
and a model law on agents licensing which have been enacted or are currently
being considered by various state legislatures and insurance departments it is
not anticipated that the insurance regulatory aspects of the act will have a
material effect on our operations

         our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state
guaranty funds when an insurer in that jurisdiction has been judicially declared
insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to
pay policyholders and claimants the protection afforded under a states
guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to
state generally all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be
members of the fund and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of
direct written premiums the naic model postassessment guaranty fund act which
many states have adopted limits assessments to an insurer to 2 of its subject
premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting likewise
several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance
subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with
regard to deficits in certain lines of business to date assessments have not
had a material adverse impact on operations

         we receive funds from our insurance subsidiaries in the form of
dividends and fees for certain management services annual dividends in excess
of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the
approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance
subsidiary is domiciled

competition

         the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are
competitive with over 2000 insurance companies transacting business in the
united states we compete directly with a large number of these companies our
strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or
geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive
advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions each of our
subsidiaries establishes its own pricing practices such practices are based
upon a companywide philosophy to price products with the general intent of
making an underwriting profit competition in the industry generally changes
with profitability

         competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from
other specialty insurers regional carriers large national multiline companies
and reinsurers under certain market conditions standard carriers also compete
for es business with the implementation of commercial lines deregulation see
regulation competition for es business might increase significantly

         competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and
foreign reinsurers which place their business either on a direct basis or
through the broker market

         the regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and
other regional stock companies as well as national carriers direct writers of
property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing
insurance through their salaried employees generally at a lower cost than
through independent agents such as those used by the company also certain
personal lines have become more competitive due to internetbased competition

         the international operations compete with native insurance operations
both large and small which may be related to government entities as well as
with branch or local subsidiaries of multinational companies

employees

         as of march 5 2001 we employed 4426 persons of this number our
subsidiaries employed 4378 persons of whom 2256 were executive and
administrative personnel and 2122 were clerical personnel we employed the
remaining 48 persons at the parent company and in investment operations of whom
36 were executive and administrative personnel and 12 were clerical personnel

other information about the companys business

         we maintain an ongoing interest in acquiring additional companies and
developing new insurance entities products and packages as opportunities arise
in addition the insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of
business to meet the needs of insureds

         seasonal weather variations affect the severity and frequency of losses
sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries although the effect on
our business of such natural catastrophes as tornadoes hurricanes hailstorms
and earthquakes is mitigated by reinsurance they nevertheless can have a
significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods

         we have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our
consolidated revenues

         compliance by w r berkley and its subsidiaries with federal state
and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge
of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the
environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures
earnings or competitive position

                 certain factors that may affect future results

      our business faces significant risks the risks described below may not be
the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we
currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations if any
of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs our
business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and
adversely affected

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical
changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry

      the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry
historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties
the industrys profitability can be affected significantly by

        rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the
         time they price their products

        volatile and unpredictable developments including weatherrelated and
         other natural catastrophes

        changes in reserves resulting from the general claims and legal
         environments as different types of claims arise and judicial
         interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liability develop

        fluctuations in interest rates inflationary pressures and other
         changes in the investment environment which affect returns on invested
         capital and may impact the ultimate payout of loss amounts and

        the longtail and volatile nature of the reinsurance business which
         may impact our operating results and limit opportunities for adequate
         returns

      the demand for property casualty insurance can also vary significantly
rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as such
activity decreases the property casualty insurance industry historically has a
cyclical nature recently the property casualty insurance industry and
especially the commercial lines business have been very competitive these
fluctuations in demand and competition could produce underwriting results that
would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial
condition

we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses

      we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of
business we compete and will continue to compete with major us and nonus
insurers and reinsurers other regional companies as well as mutual companies
specialty insurance companies underwriting agencies and diversified financial
services companies some of our competitors


                                       18

particularly in the reinsurance business have greater financial and marketing
resources than we do

      a number of new proposed or potential legislative or industry
developments could further increase competition in our industry these
developments include

        the enactment of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 which could result
         in increased competition from new entrants to our markets

        the implementation of commercial lines deregulation in several states
         which could increase competition from standard carriers for our excess
         and surplus lines of insurance business

        programs in which statesponsored entities provide property insurance
         in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative markets types of
         coverage and

        changing practices caused by the internet which have led to greater
         competition in the insurance business

      new competition from these developments could cause the supply andor
demand for insurance or reinsurance to change which could adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition

      in addition to competition in the operation of our businesses we face
competition from a variety of sources in attracting and retaining qualified
employees we can provide no assurance that we will maintain our current
competitive position in the markets in which we operate or that we will be able
to expand our operations into new markets if we fail to do so our businesses
could be materially adversely affected

our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims

      we maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for unpaid
losses and loss adjustment expenses including legal and other fees as well as a
portion of our general expenses for reported and unreported claims incurred as
of the end of each accounting period reserves do not represent an exact
calculation of liability rather reserves represent an estimate of what we
expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost these
estimates which generally involve actuarial projections are based on our
assessment of facts and circumstances then known as well as estimates of future
trends in claims severity frequency judicial theories of liability and other
factors in some cases longtail lines of business such as excess workers
compensation and the workers compensation portion of our reinsurance business
are reserved on a discounted basis the variables described above are affected
by both internal and external events such as changes in claims handling
procedures inflation judicial and litigation trends and legislative changes
the risk of the occurrence of such events is especially present in our specialty
lines and reinsurance businesses many of these items are not directly
quantifiable in advance in some areas of our business the level of reserves we
establish is dependent in part upon the actions of third parties that are beyond
our control in our reinsurance and excess workers compensation businesses we
may not establish sufficient reserves if third parties do not give us advance
notice or provide us with appropriate information regarding certain matters
additionally there may be a significant delay between the occurrence of the
insured event and the time it is reported to us

      the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain
types of liabilities where the various considerations affecting these types of
claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before a
definitive determination of liability is made reserve estimates are continually
refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are
reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of
the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting reserves is
inherently uncertain we can provide no assurance that our current reserves will
prove adequate in light of subsequent events

we anticipate increasing our level of retention in our business

     we anticipate increasing our retention levels in 2001 for our operations
generally due to changes in market conditions and the pricing environment we
expect to purchase less reinsurance the process by which we transfer or cede
part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company thereby retaining
more risk as a result our earnings could be more volatile and increased
severities could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations
and financial condition a significant change in our retention levels could also
cause our historical financial results including compound annual growth rates
to be inaccurate indicators of our future performance on a segment or
consolidated basis

as a property casualty insurer we face losses from catastrophes

    property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes
that may have a significant effect on their results of operations liquidity and
financial condition catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our
results catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes
windstorms earthquakes hailstorms explosions severe winter weather and
fires the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount
of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the
event most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however
hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large heavily
populated areas catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property
casualty lines and most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted
from severe storms seasonal weather variations may affect the severity and
frequency of our losses insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a
catastrophe until it has occurred it is therefore possible that a catastrophic
event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect upon
our results of operations and financial condition

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation

    we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision most
insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders
rather than stockholders and other investors this system of regulation
generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do
business relates to among other things

  standards of solvency including riskbased capital measurements

  restrictions on the nature quality and concentration of investments

  requiring certain methods of accounting

  requiring reserves for unearned premium losses and other purposes and

  potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the
    settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired
    insolvent or failed insurance companies

    state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of
insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating
to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and
other matters recently adopted federal financial services modernization
legislation is expected to lead to additional federal regulation of the
insurance industry in the coming years also foreign governments regulate our
international operations

    we can provide no assurance that we have or can maintain all required
licenses and approvals or that our business fully complies with the wide variety
of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of
the laws and regulations also some regulatory authorities have relatively
broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses and approvals if we do not
have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable
regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or
temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or
monetarily penalize us that type of action could have a material adverse effect
on our business also changes in the level of regulation of the insurance
industry whether federal state or foreign or changes in laws or regulations
themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could have a material
adverse effect on our business

we are rated by am best and standard  poors and a decline in these ratings
could adversely affect our operations

    ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the
competitive position of insurance companies our insurance company subsidiaries
are rated by am best and certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are
rated for their claimspaying ability by standard  poors corporation or
standard  poors am best and standard  poors ratings reflect their
opinions of an insurance companys financial strength operating performance
strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders are not
evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy sell or
hold our securities our ratings are subject to periodic review by am best and
standard  poors and the continued retention of those ratings cannot be
assured the standard  poors 2001 outlook for the us property casualty
insurance industry and the standard  poors midyear 2000 outlook for the us
reinsurance industry were negative since march 2000 standard  poors has
given us a negative rating outlook while standard  poors recently affirmed
our rating of a as long as we remain on negative rating outlook a downgrade
in our rating is possible if our ratings


                                       20
page   21
are reduced from their current levels by am best andor standard  poors our
results of operations could be adversely affected

a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is
subject to market fluctuations

    our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income securities
the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these
assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions with
respect to our investments in fixed income securities the fair market value of
these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship
with fluctuations in interest rates while net investment income realized by us
from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or
decrease with interest rates in addition actual net investment income andor
cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk such as mortgagebacked
and other assetbacked securities may differ from those anticipated at the time
of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations because substantially
all of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale changes
in the market value of our securities are reflected in our balance sheet
similar treatment is not available for liabilities therefore interest rate
fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition

we invest some of our assets in merger arbitrage which is subject to certain
risks

    we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in merger arbitrage as of
december 31 2000 our investment in merger arbitrage securities represented
approximately 14 of our total investment portfolio merger arbitrage is the
business of investing in the securities of publicly held companies which are the
targets in announced tender offers and mergers merger arbitrage differs from
other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed
likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period
usually four months or less while our merger arbitrage positions are
generally hedged against market declines these equity investments are exposed
primarily to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals which
are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks

our premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability of
reinsurance

    we purchase reinsurance for significant amounts of risk underwritten by our
insurance company subsidiaries especially catastrophe risks we also purchase
reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure a retrocession
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the
reinsurance protection we purchase which may affect the level of our business
and profitability our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual
renewal we can provide no assurance that we can maintain our current
reinsurance facilities or that we can obtain other reinsurance facilities in
adequate amounts and at favorable rates if we are unable to renew our expiring
facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities either our net exposures
would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we
would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments especially
catastrophe exposed risks either of these potential developments could have a
material adverse effect on our business

we do not yet know all the effects of the recent restructuring of certain of our
subsidiaries

    in 2000 we implemented a restructuring plan pursuant to which we refocused
our domestic reinsurance operations while this restructuring is substantially
complete all of its operating effects are not yet known and any difficulties
caused by such restructuring could adversely affect our results of operations
and financial condition

we are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive
dividends in needed amounts

    our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance
company subsidiaries we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company
subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on
outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and
corporate expenses the payment of dividends by our insurance company
subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the
surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries as well as the regulatory
restrictions as a result we may not be able to receive dividends from these
subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations or pay
dividends


                                       21

we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and even if we do we may not
successfully integrate any such acquired companies

    as part of our present strategy we continue to evaluate possible
acquisition transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time we may be
engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions we can provide no
assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions
that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or
that our future acquisitions will be successful the process of integrating any
companies we do acquire may have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition

if we do not invest substantial amounts in our information systems and
technology our business may be harmed

    integrated management information and processing systems are vital to our
ability to monitor costs collect receivables and achieve operating
efficiencies as we continue our growth the need for sophisticated information
systems and technology will increase significantly the cost of implementing
such systems has been and is expected to continue to be substantial the
failure of our information or processing systems or our failure to upgrade
systems as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all

    we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have
assumed known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the
premium we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the
reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the
reinsurer it does not relieve us the reinsured of our liability to our
policyholders or in cases where we are a reinsurer to our reinsureds
accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers we can provide
no assurance that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to
us or that they will pay such recoverables on a timely basis

our international operations expose us to risks

    certain assets held by our foreign subsidiaries are subject to foreign
currency risk our principal area of exposure relates to fluctuations in
exchange rates between each of the argentinean and philippine peso and the us
dollar consequently a change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and
either the argentinean or philippine peso could have an adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition we are additionally subject to
political and economic risks in these countries

item 3 legal proceedings

    claims under insurance policies written by our insurance subsidiaries are
investigated and settled either by claims adjusters employed by them by their
independent agents or by independent adjusters generally the insurance
subsidiary employs a staff of claims adjusters at its home office and at some
regional offices some independent agents may have the authority to settle small
claims independent claims adjusting firms are used to assist in handling
various claims in areas where insurance volume does not warrant the maintenance
of a

staff adjuster if a claim or loss cannot be settled and results in litigation
the subsidiary generally retains outside counsel

    at present neither w r berkley nor any of its subsidiaries is engaged in
any litigation known to us which is expected to have a material adverse effect
upon our business as is common with property casualty insurance companies our
subsidiaries are regularly engaged in the defense of claims arising out of the
conduct of the insurance business
