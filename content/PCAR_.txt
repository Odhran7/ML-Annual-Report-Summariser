description of business 

paccar is a multinational company operating in three principal industry segments 







paccar’s other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches

trucks

paccar’s trucks are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia brasil canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of commercial and consumer goods the company also designs and manufactures diesel engines primarily for use in the company’s trucks at its facilities in columbus mississippi eindhoven the netherlands and ponta grossa brasil paccar competes in the north american class 8 market primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in chillicothe ohio denton texas renton washington and mexicali mexico paccar also competes in the north american class 6 to 7 markets primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada denton texas and mexicali mexico paccar competes in the european lightmedium market with daf coe trucks assembled in the united kingdom uk by leyland one of paccar’s wholly owned subsidiaries and participates in the european heavy market with daf coe trucks assembled in the netherlands and the uk paccar competes in the brazilian heavy truck market with daf models assembled at ponta grossa in the state of paraná brasil paccar competes in the australian medium and heavy truck markets with kenworth conventional and coe models and certain daf coe models assembled at its facility at bayswater in the state of victoria australia and daf coe models primarily assembled in the uk commercial truck manufacturing comprises the largest segment of paccar’s business and accounted for 71 of total 2021 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands and is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in brasil and australia the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to paccar’s truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions some manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis reflecting the similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate 

 

 

the company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specifications some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures paccar engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models the company also manufactures engines at its columbus mississippi facility in 202 1  the company installed paccar engines in approximately 38  of the company’s kenworth and peterbilt heavy ‑duty trucks in the us and canada and substantially all of the daf heavyduty trucks sold throughout the world engines not manufactured by the company are purchased from cummins inc cummins the company purchased a significant portion of its transmissions from eaton corporation plc eaton and zf friedrichshafen ag zf the company also purchased a significant portion of north america stampings used for cabs from magna international inc magna the company has longterm agreements with cummins eaton zf and magna to provide for continuity of supply a loss of supply from cummins eaton zf or magna and the resulting interruption in the production of trucks would have a material effect on the company’s results purchased materials and parts include raw materials partially processed materials such as castings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers raw materials partially processed materials and finished components typically make up approximately 8 5  of the cost of new trucks the value of finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 3 6  in europe to approximately 8 6  in north america in addition to materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain factory overhead costs such as facilities depreciation property taxes and utilities the company’s cost of sales are highly correlated to sales 

the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3 of consolidated revenues in 2021 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would require the company to either contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself 

other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks are dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical based on the level of overall economic activity the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s costs for trucks consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components and engages in hedging activities for some commodities in certain geographical markets the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as changes to diesel engine emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

there are four principal competitors in the us and canada commercial truck market the company’s share of the us and canadian class 8 market was 292 of retail sales in 2021 and the company’s mediumduty market share was 198 in europe there are six principal competitors in the commercial truck market including parent companies to four competitors of the company in the us in 2021 daf had a 159 share of the european heavyduty market and a 101 share of the lightmediumduty market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales

the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

the company’s truck products are subject to noise emission and safety regulations competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with these regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

the company had a total production backlog of 159 billion at the end of 2021 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90‑day backlog approximated 52 billion at december 31 2021 46 billion at december 31 2020 and 33 billion at december 31 2019 production of the yearend 2021 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2022

 

 

parts 

the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles to over 2200 kenworth peterbilt and daf dealers in 95 countries around the world aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s 18 strategically located parts distribution centers pdcs in the us canada europe australia mexico and central and south america parts are primarily purchased from various suppliers and also manufactured by the company aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery the parts segment accounted for 21 of total 2021 net sales and revenues

key factors affecting parts segment earnings include the aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks to reflect the benefit the parts segment receives from costs incurred by the truck segment certain factory overhead research and development engineering and sga expenses are allocated from the truck segment to the parts segment the company’s cost for parts sold consists primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the cost of parts sold the company maintains rigorous control of sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

financial services 

paccar financial services pfs operates in 26 countries in north america europe australia and south america through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name pfs also conducts fullservice leasing operations through operating divisions or wholly owned subsidiaries in north america germany and australia under the paclease trade name selected dealers in north america are franchised to provide fullservice leasing pfs provides its franchisees with equipment financing and administrative support pfs also operates its own full service lease outlets pfs’s retail loan and lease customers consist of small medium and large commercial trucking companies independent owneroperators and other businesses and acquire their paccar trucks principally from independent paccar dealers pfs accounted for 7 of total net sales and revenues and 53 of total assets in 2021

pfs is primarily responsible for managing the sales of the company’s used trucks the company’s financial services segment sells used trucks returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business and trucks acquired from repossessions pfs also obtains used trucks from the truck segment in trades related to new truck sales and trucks returned from residual value guarantees rvgs certain gains and losses from the sale of used trucks are shared with the truck segment the company’s financial services segment records revenue on the sale of used trucks received in trade and rvg returns

the company’s finance receivables are classified as dealer wholesale dealer retail and customer retail segments the dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to independent paccar dealers the dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises which use the proceeds to fund their customers’ acquisition of trucks and related equipment the customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for their acquisition of trucks and related equipment customer retail receivables are further segregated by fleet and owneroperator classes the fleet class consists of customers operating more than five trucks all others are considered owneroperators similar methods are employed to assess and monitor credit risk for each class

finance receivables are secured by the trucks and related equipment being financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts generally range from three to five years depending on the type and use of equipment payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one year 

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in public and private offerings and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies pfs matches the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases 

key factors affecting the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases the ability to collect the amounts owed to pfs the volume of used truck sales and used truck prices new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by kenworth peterbilt and daf and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment the company’s financial services market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market pfs’s primary competitors include commercial banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

 

 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of pfs to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term pfs obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings a portion of which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interestrate contracts this enables pfs to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the acquisition cost of leased equipment the term of the leases which generally ranges from three to five years  and the residual value of the leases which generally ranges from 30 to 70 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation including interest and depreciation 

pfs incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts pfs takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses

the ability of customers to pay their obligations to pfs depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel among other factors pfs limits its exposure to any one customer with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 5 of the aggregate portfolio assets pfs generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck collateral and may require other collateral or guarantees in the event of default pfs will repossess the truck and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network as well as pfs used truck centers pfs will also seek to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices pfs’s experience over the last sixty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness pfs provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the current and forecasted economic conditions of its geographic markets

financial services sga expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the loan and lease portfolios these costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend to be relatively stable

other businesses 

other businesses include the manufacturing of industrial winches in two us plants and marketing them under the braden carco and gearmatic nameplates the markets for these products are highly competitive and the company competes with a number of well established firms sales of industrial winches were less than 1 of total net sales and revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 

the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products

risk factors

tableend

the following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations

business and industry risks

commercial truck market demand is variable  the company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the company’s equipment and services the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america and europe demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors 

competition and prices the company operates in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect the company’s sales and pricing financial results depend largely on the ability to develop manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand 

production costs capacity and inflation the company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs commodity or component price increases cost pressures due to inflation sign ificant shortages of component products and labor availability may adversely impact the company’s financial results or use of its production capacity many of the company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity unexpected events including natural disasters extreme weather events or global pandemics may increase the company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the company’s or its suppliers’ operations 

the automotive industry is currently experiencing a semiconductor supply shortage that is having wideranging effects across the automotive supply chain including some of the company’s suppliers during 2021 the shortage has had an impact on the ability of the company to deliver products to dealers and customers if the semiconductor supply shortage continues the company anticipates that production will be impacted in 2022 

liquidity risks credit ratings and costs of funds disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the company’s sources of liquidity or the liquidity of customers dealers and suppliers a lowering of the company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets the company’s financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt if the markets for commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s financial services segment competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in used truck prices are also factors which may affect the company’s financial services segment 

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

interestrate risks the financial services segment is subject to interestrate risks because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins pfs uses derivative contracts to match the interestrate characteristics of it s debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates 

 

 

information technology the company relies on information technology systems and networks to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of its business processes and activities these computer systems and networks may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures computer viruses or outside parties attempting to disrupt the company’s business or gain unauthorized access to the company’s electronic data the company maintains and continues to invest in protections to guard against such events examples of these protections include conducting thirdparty penetration tests implementing software detection and prevention tools event monitoring and disaster recoverability additionally the company maintains a cybersecurity insurance policy despite these safeguards there remains a risk of system disruptions unauthorized access and data loss 

if the company’s computer systems were to be damaged disrupted or breached it could impact data availability and integrity result in a theft of the company’s intellectual property or lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information of the company’s customers suppliers and employees security breaches could also result in a violation of us and international privacy and other laws and subject the company to various litigations and governmental proceedings these events could have an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition damage its reputation disrupt operations and negatively impact competitiveness in the marketplace

political regulatory and economic risks

multinational operations  the company’s global operations are exposed to political economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems natural calamities wars terrorism and labor strikes changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and international trade policies may impact demand for the company’s products financial results and competitive position paccar’s global operations are subject to extensive trade competition and anticorruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs 

 

covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic and various governmental responses to contain the outbreak continue to impact global economic activity and the company’s business the economic disruptions from the pandemic are having an adverse effect on the company’s revenues and operating results the company’s workforce at a given location could be affected by a localized outbreak of covid19 necessitating facility slowdowns or shutdowns as a result of pandemicrelated economic disruptions if one or more of the company’s suppliers could not produce needed parts or deliver at sufficient volumes to support the company’s production plans or aftermarket requirements revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

the full extent and duration of the adverse effect on the company’s business is uncertain and depends on the duration of the pandemic and the extent global and local economies are impacted by the effects of the pandemic changes to consumer behavior and labor markets as a result of covid19 as well as other pandemic related economic factors such as business failures lower housing and construction starts lower automobile sales disruptions in financial markets or disruptions to the global supply chain in particular the undersupply of semiconductor chips could have further adverse effects on the company’s truck and parts revenues and operating results and may result in lower new truck financing volume higher finance portfolio past dues credit losses and used truck losses other unforeseen impacts of the covid19 pandemic could also impact the company’s business and results of operations

 

london interbank offered rate libor transition certain financing provided by pfs to dealers and retail customers as well as financing extended to pfs are based on variable interest rate contracts these contracts utilize various benchmark rates including libor to establish applicable contract interest rates paccar also utilizes hedging instruments and has line of credit arrangements which reference libor including other similar benchmark rates on march 5 2021 the uk financial conduct authority formally announced dates that various libor rates will either stop being published or will be deemed as not representative certain tenors of us libor will be published through june 30 2023 at which point they will have deemed to have lost representativeness 

 

substantially all of the company’s contracts which reference libor including dealer wholesale financing contracts retail loan and lease contracts mediumterm notes hedging instruments and line of credit arrangements include fallback language that specifies the methods to establish contract interest rates in the absence of libor or provide for the use of an alternative benchmark rate should libor be discontinued alternative benchmark rates are now being used for all new retail loan and lease contracts 

 

the company has retail loan and lease contracts with a december 31 2021 balance of approximately 47 million or less than 1 of pfs assets referencing libor that extend beyond june 30 2023 and do not contain fallback language or provide for the use of an alternative benchmark rate the company will seek to amend these contracts to allow for the use of an alternative benchmark rate

 

 

 

 

changes to benchmark rates will have an uncertain impact on finance receivables and other financial obligations the company’s current or future cost of funds andor access to capital markets the company will attempt to minimize the impact of differences between the current and replacement benchmark rates through pricing adjustments on the financing provided by pfs but it is not certain the company will be able to do so based on the current balance of finance contracts referencing libor it is estimated that for a 10 basis point difference between the current and replacement benchmark rates that the company is unable to recover through pricing adjustments income before income taxes would decrease by approximately 7 million accordingly the company does not expect the anticipated changes to the use of libor as a benchmark rate will have a material impact on the results of operations

environmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs the company could experience higher research and development and manufacturing costs due to changes in government requirements for its products including changes in emissions fuel greenhouse gas or other regulations 

litigation product liability and regulatory the company’s products are subject to recall for environmental performance and safetyrelated issues product recalls lawsuits regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the company establishes for contingencies may increase the company’s costs and lower profits due to the international nature of the company’s business some products are also subject to international trade regulations including customs and import  export related laws and regulations government embargoes and sanctions prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries as well as anticorruption laws the company’s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets and claims or regulatory actions even if unsuccessful or without merit could adversely affect the company’s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity 

currency exchange and translation the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the company’s assets liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk as reported in the company’s financial statements the company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce but not eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

accounting estimates in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented certain of these estimates judgments and assumptions such as residual values on operating leases the allowance for credit losses and product warranty are particularly sensitive if actual results are different from estimates used by management they may have a material impact on the financial statements for additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates see “critical accounting policies” under item 7 of this form 10k 

taxes changes in stat utory income tax rates in the countries in which the company operates impact the company’s effective tax rate changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the company’s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities

the company believes its cash balances and investments collections on existing finance receivables committed bank facilities and current investmentgrade credit ratings of aa1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability in the event of a decrease in the company’s credit ratings or a disruption in the financial markets the company may not be able to refinance its maturing debt in the financial markets in such circumstances the company would be exposed to liquidity risk to the degree that the timing of debt maturities differs from the timing of receivable collections from customers the company believes its various sources of liquidity including committed bank facilities would continue to provide it with sufficient funding resources to service its maturing debt obligations

impact of environmental matters

the company its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment the company believes its policies practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred 

the company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters in certain of these matters the company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies the company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were 40 million and 19 million respectively while the timing and amount of the ultimate costs associated with future environmental cleanup cannot be determined management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the company’s consolidated cash flow liquidity or financial condition

 

 

critical accounting policies 

the company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a of the consolidated financial statements in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented the following are accounting policies which in the opinion of management are particularly sensitive and which if actual results are different from estimates used by management may have a material impact on the financial statements 

operating leases

trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in note f of the consolidated financial statements in determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles the company considers the length of the lease term the truck model the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand operating lease terms generally range from three to five years the resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30 and 70 of the original equipment cost if the sales price of a truck at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the company’s estimated residual value a gain or loss will result 

future market conditions changes in government regulations and other factors outside the company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant a decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term 

during 2021   market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally higher than the residual values on the equipment resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of 218 million   

at december 31 2021 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the financial services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the truck segment was 217 billion a 10 decrease in used truck values worldwide if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the company’s operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the company recording additional depreciation expense of approximately 841 million in 2022 531 in 2023 550 in 2024 167 in 2025 and 85 in 2026 and thereafter 

allowance for credit losses

the allowance for credit losses related to the company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in note e of the consolidated financial statements the company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments retail and wholesale the retail segment consists of retail loans and finance leases net of unearned interest the wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral the wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables and the company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets in determining the allowance for credit losses retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest generally over three to five years and they are secured by the same type of collateral the allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves 

the company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss a finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in addition all retail loans and leases which have been classified as tdrs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired generally impaired accounts are on nonaccrual status impaired accounts classified as tdrs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the company will collect all principal and interest payments

impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses the determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral when the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the company’s amortized cost basis no reserve is recorded small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss and economic forecasts information discussed below 

 

 

 

 

the company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired and share similar risk characteristics on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information using past due account data current market conditions and expected changes in future macroeconomic conditions that affect collectability historical credit loss information provides relevant information of expected credit losses the historical information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts repossession rates and the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse

 

the company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions a projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the company’s borrowers and their ability to repay adjustments to historical loss information are made for changes in forecasted economic conditions that are specific to the industry and markets in which the company conducts business the company utilizes economic forecasts from third party sources and determines expected losses based on historical experience under similar market conditions after determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of expected credit losses net of recoveries inherent in the portfolio

 

the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current and future market conditions as accounts become past due the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases the company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 30 and 70 over the past two years the company’s yearend 30 days past due accounts have ranged between 3 and 5 of loan and lease receivables historically a 100 basis point increase in the 30 days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 3 to 44 basis points of receivables at december 31 2021 30 days past dues were 3 if past dues were 100 basis points higher or 13 as of december 31 2021 the company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of 3 to 44 million depending on the extent of the past dues the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors 

product warranty

business

tableend



paccar inc the company or paccar incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1971 is the successor to pacific car and foundry company which was incorporated in washington in 1924 the company traces its predecessors to seattle car manufacturing company formed in 1905 



information about the company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to items 101c1i of regulation sk appears in item 8 note s of this form 10k 



paccar is a multinational company operating in three principal industry segments 







paccar’s other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches

trucks

paccar’s trucks are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia brasil canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of commercial and consumer goods the company also manufactures engines primarily for use in the company’s trucks at its facilities in columbus mississippi eindhoven the netherlands and ponta grossa brasil paccar competes in the north american class 8 market primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in chillicothe ohio denton texas renton washington mexicali mexico and ste therese canada paccar also competes in the north american class 6 to 7 markets primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada denton texas and mexicali mexico paccar competes in the european lightmedium market with daf coe trucks assembled in the united kingdom uk by leyland one of paccar’s wholly owned subsidiaries and participates in the european heavy market with daf coe trucks assembled in the netherlands and the uk paccar competes in the brazilian heavy truck market with daf models assembled at ponta grossa in the state of paraná brasil paccar competes in the australian medium and heavy truck markets with kenworth conventional and coe models and certain daf coe models assembled at its facility at bayswater in the state of victoria australia and daf coe models primarily assembled in the uk commercial truck manufacturing comprises the largest segment of paccar’s business and accounted for 70 of total 2020 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands and is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in brasil and australia the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to paccar’s truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions some manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis reflecting the similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate 

 

the company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specifications some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures paccar engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models the company also manufactures engines at its columbus mississippi facility in 2020 the company installed paccar engines in approximately 40 of the company’s kenworth and peterbilt heavy ‑duty trucks in the us and canada and substantially all of the daf heavyduty trucks sold throughout the world engines not manufactured by the company are purchased from cummins inc cummins the company purchased a significant portion of its transmissions from eaton corporation plc eaton and zf friedrichshafen ag zf the company also purchased a significant portion of north america stampings used for cabs from magna international inc magna the company has longterm agreements with cummins eaton zf and magna to provide for continuity of supply a loss of supply from cummins eaton zf or magna and the resulting interruption in the production of trucks would have a material effect on the company’s results purchased materials and parts include raw materials partially processed materials such as castings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers raw materials partially processed materials and finished components make up approximately 85 of the cost of new trucks the value of major finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 32 in europe to approximately 87 in north america in addition to materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain factory overhead costs such as facilities depreciation property taxes and utilities the company’s cost of sales are highly correlated to sales 

the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3 of consolidated revenues in 2020 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would require the company to either contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself 

other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks are dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical based on the level of overall economic activity the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s costs for trucks consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as changes to diesel engine emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

there are four principal competitors in the us and canada commercial truck market the company’s share of the us and canadian class 8 market was 301 of retail sales in 2020 and the company’s mediumduty market share was 226 in europe there are six principal competitors in the commercial truck market including parent companies to three competitors of the company in the us in 2020 daf had a 163 share of the european heavyduty market and a 95 share of the lightmediumduty market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales

the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

the company’s truck products are subject to noise emission and safety regulations competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with these regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

the company had a total production backlog of 76 billion at the end of 2020 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90‑day backlog approximated 46 billion at december 31 2020 33 billion at december 31 2019 and 45 billion at december 31 2018 production of the yearend 2020 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2021

 

parts 

the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles to over 2200 kenworth peterbilt and daf dealers in 102 countries around the world aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s 18 strategically located parts distribution centers pdcs in the us canada europe australia mexico and central and south america parts are primarily purchased from various suppliers and also manufactured by the company aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery the parts segment accounted for 21 of total 2020 net sales and revenues

key factors affecting parts segment earnings include the aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks to reflect the benefit the parts segment receives from costs incurred by the truck segment certain factory overhead research and development engineering and sga expenses are allocated from the truck segment to the parts segment the company’s cost for parts sold consists primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the cost of parts sold the company maintains rigorous control of sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

financial services 

paccar financial services pfs operates in 26 countries in north america europe australia and south america through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name pfs also conducts fullservice leasing operations through operating divisions or wholly owned subsidiaries in north america germany and australia under the paclease trade name selected dealers in north america are franchised to provide fullservice leasing pfs provides its franchisees with equipment financing and administrative support pfs also operates its own full service lease outlets pfs’s retail loan and lease customers consist of small medium and large commercial trucking companies independent owneroperators and other businesses and acquire their paccar trucks principally from independent paccar dealers pfs accounted for 8 of total net sales and revenues and 56 of total assets in 2020

pfs is primarily responsible for managing the sales of the company’s used trucks the company’s financial services segment sells used trucks returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business and trucks acquired from repossessions pfs also obtains used trucks from the truck segment in trades related to new truck sales and trucks returned from residual value guarantees rvgs certain gains and losses from the sale of used trucks are shared with the truck segment the company’s financial services segment records revenue on the sale of used trucks received in trade and rvg returns

the company’s finance receivables are classified as dealer wholesale dealer retail and customer retail segments the dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to independent paccar dealers the dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises which use the proceeds to fund their customers’ acquisition of trucks and related equipment the customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for their acquisition of trucks and related equipment customer retail receivables are further segregated by fleet and owneroperator classes the fleet class consists of customers operating more than five trucks all others are considered owneroperators similar methods are employed to assess and monitor credit risk for each class

finance receivables are secured by the trucks and related equipment being financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts generally range from three to five years depending on the type and use of equipment payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one year 

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in public and private offerings and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies pfs matches the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases 

key factors affecting the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to pfs new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by kenworth peterbilt and daf and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment the company’s financial services market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market pfs’s primary competitors include commercial banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of pfs to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term pfs obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings a portion of which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interestrate contracts this enables pfs to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the acquisition cost of leased equipment the term of the leases which generally ranges from three to five years and the residual value of the leases which generally ranges from 30 to 70 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation including interest and depreciation 

pfs incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts pfs takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses

the ability of customers to pay their obligations to pfs depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel among other factors pfs limits its exposure to any one customer with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 5 of the aggregate portfolio assets pfs generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck collateral and may require other collateral or guarantees in the event of default pfs will repossess the truck and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network as well as pfs used truck centers pfs will also seek to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices pfs’s experience over the last sixty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness pfs provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the current and forecasted economic conditions of its geographic markets

financial services sga expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the loan and lease portfolios these costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend to be relatively stable

other businesses 

other businesses include the manufacturing of industrial winches in two us plants and marketing them under the braden carco and gearmatic nameplates the markets for these products are highly competitive and the company competes with a number of well established firms sales of industrial winches were less than 1 of total net sales and revenues in 2020 2019 and 2018 

the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products

 item 1a 

risk factors

tableend

the following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations

business and industry risks

commercial truck market demand is variable  the company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the company’s equipment and services the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america and europe demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors 

competition and prices the company operates in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect the company’s sales and pricing financial results depend largely on the ability to develop manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand 

production costs and supplier capacity the company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the company’s financial results or use of its production capacity many of the company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity unexpected events including natural disasters may increase the company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the company’s or its suppliers’ operations 

the automotive industry is currently experiencing a semiconductor supply shortage that is having wideranging effects across the automotive supply chain including some of the company’s suppliers the shortage may have a shortterm impact on the ability of the company to deliver products to dealers and customers 

liquidity risks credit ratings and costs of funds disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the company’s sources of liquidity or the liquidity of customers dealers and suppliers a lowering of the company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets the company’s financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt if the markets for commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s financial services segment competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values and used truck inventory values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the company’s financial services segment 

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

interestrate risks the financial services segment is subject to interestrate risks because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins pfs uses derivative contracts to match the interestrate characteristics of its debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates 

 

information technology the company relies on information technology systems and networks to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of its business processes and activities these computer systems and networks may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures computer viruses or outside parties attempting to disrupt the company’s business or gain unauthorized access to the company’s electronic data the company maintains and continues to invest in protections to guard against such events examples of these protections include conducting thirdparty penetration tests implementing software detection and prevention tools event monitoring and disaster recoverability additionally the company maintains a cybersecurity insurance policy despite these safeguards there remains a risk of system disruptions unauthorized access and data loss 

if the company’s computer systems were to be damaged disrupted or breached it could impact data availability and integrity result in a theft of the company’s intellectual property or lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information of the company’s customers suppliers and employees security breaches could also result in a violation of us and international privacy and other laws and subject the company to various litigations and governmental proceedings these events could have an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition damage its reputation disrupt operations and negatively impact competitiveness in the marketplace

political regulatory and economic risks

multinational operations  the company’s global operations are exposed to political economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems natural calamities wars terrorism and labor strikes changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and i nternational trade policies may impact demand for the company’s products financial results and competitive position paccar’s global operations are subject to extensive trade competition and anticorruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs 

 

covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic and various governmental responses to contain the outbreak have resulted in a significant reduction in global economic activity national and local governments have issued various stayathome orders travel restrictions and border closures affecting consumers and businesses these restrictions have been lifted to various degrees in different locations but are subject to being reimposed the company’s operations have been designated as essential businesses in many jurisdictions as they support the transport of food medical supplies and other essential materials which means the company may operate under certain conditions including ensuring employee health and safety is maintained the company’s workforce at a given location could be affected by a localized outbreak of covid19 necessitating facility shutdowns if the company suspends production at one or more of its factories as a result of the pandemic or related impacts or if one or more of the company’s suppliers could not produce needed parts or not produce at sufficient volumes to support the company’s production plans or aftermarket requirements revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

the full extent and duration of the adverse effect on the company’s business is uncertain and depends on the severity of the pandemic and how quickly and to what extent global and local economies are able to recover from the effects of the pandemic prolonged unemployment changes in consumer behavior as a result of covid19 as well as other pandemic related economic factors such as business failures lower housing and construction starts lower automobile sales and disruptions in financial markets could have further adverse effects on the company’s truck and parts revenues and operating results and may result in higher finance portfolio past dues credit losses and used truck losses other unforeseen impacts of the covid19 pandemic could also impact the company’s business and results of operations

 

uk exit from the european union eu  the company manufactures medium and heavyduty daf trucks in the uk which are sold primarily in the uk and to a lesser extent in europe and other world markets in 2020 approximately 10 of the company’s worldwide truck production was manufactured in the uk the eu and uk concluded negotiations on the euuk trade and cooperation agreement euuk tca which was passed by the uk parliament on december 30 2020 and is pending formal consent of the european parliament which is expected in early 2021 the euuk tca provides for continued tarifffree quotafree access for products traded between the uk and the eu subject to rules of origin requirements the company believes it will qualify for the proposed rules of origin requirements 

 

london interbank offered rate libor transition certain financing provided by pfs to dealers and retail customers as well as financing extended to pfs are based on variable interest rate contracts these contracts utilize various benchmark rates including libor to establish applicable contract interest rates paccar also utilizes hedging instruments and has line of credit arrangements which reference libor including other similar benchmark rates in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of libor after 2021 at this time it is not clear if libor will continue to exist and if not what alternative benchmark rates will replace libor in the marketplace any 

 

new benchmark rate will likely not replicate libor exactly which could impact currently active contracts which terminate after 2021 or after such other date when libor may cease to exist 

 

substantially all of the company’s contracts which reference libor including dealer wholesale financing contracts mediumterm notes hedging instruments and line of credit arrangements include fallback language that specifies the methods to establish contract interest rates in the absence of libor or provide for the use of an alternative benchmark rate should libor be discontinued the company has efforts underway to offer new finance contracts which makes use of alternative benchmark rates in replacement of all instances where libor was previously used these efforts are expected to be completed prior to december 31 2021

 

the company has retail loan and lease contracts with a december 31 2020 balance of approximately 148 million or less than 1 of pfs assets referencing libor that extend beyond 2021 and do not contain fallback language or provide for the use of an alternative benchmark rate the company will seek to amend these contracts to allow for the use of an alternative benchmark rate

 

changes to benchmark rates will have an uncertain impact on finance receivables and other financial obligations our current or future cost of funds andor access to capital markets the company will attempt to minimize the impact of differences between the current and replacement benchmark rates through pricing adjustments on the financing provided by pfs but it is not certain the company will be able to do so based on the current balance of finance contracts referencing libor it is estimated that for a 10 basis point difference between the current and replacement benchmark rates that the company is unable to recover through pricing adjustments income before income taxes would decrease by approximately 16 million accordingly the company does not expect the anticipated changes to the use of libor as a benchmark rate will have a material impact on the results of operations

parts outlook

the company continues to provide strong aftermarket support to enable the shipment of essential goods and services to communities around the world while following social distancing and hygiene protocols strengthening economies and higher truck traffic in the second half of the year resulted in increased demand for aftermarket parts as compared to the first half of the year in 2021 paccar parts sales are expected to increase 79 from 2020 levels if economic conditions were to worsen lower freight volumes could reduce the demand for replacement parts resulting in lower parts revenues and operating results

financial services outlook

based on the truck market outlook average earning assets in 2021 are expected to increase 46 compared to 2020 current high levels of freight tonnage freight rates and fleet utilization are contributing to customers’ profitability and cash flow if current freight transportation conditions decline due to weaker economic conditions then past due accounts truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current low levels and new business volume would likely decline

in august 2018 the company’s australian subsidiary paccar financial pty ltd pfpl registered a mediumterm note program the program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program the total amount of mediumterm notes outstanding for pfpl as of december 31 2020 was 4500 million australian dollars

the company believes its cash balances and investments collections on existing finance receivables committed bank facilities and current investmentgrade credit ratings of aa1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability in the event of a decrease in the company’s credit ratings or a disruption in the financial markets the company may not be able to refinance its maturing debt in the financial markets in such circumstances the company would be exposed to liquidity risk to the degree that the timing of debt maturities differs from the timing of receivable collections from customers the company believes its various sources of liquidity including committed bank facilities would continue to provide it with sufficient funding resources to service its maturing debt obligations

 

commitments 

the following summarizes the company’s contractual cash commitments at december 31 2020

the company’s other commitments include the following at december 31 2020

 



 

loan and lease commitments are for funding new retail loan and lease contracts residual value guarantees represent the company’s commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value if the customer decides to return the truck at a specified date in the future 

impact of environmental matters

the company its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment the company believes its policies practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred 

the company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters in certain of these matters the company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies the company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 were 19 million and 13 million respectively while the timing and amount of the ultimate costs associated with future environmental cleanup cannot be determined management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the company’s consolidated cash flow liquidity or financial condition

 

critical accounting policies 

the company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a of the consolidated financial statements in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented the following are accounting policies which in the opinion of management are particularly sensitive and which if actual results are different from estimates used by management may have a material impact on the financial statements 

operating leases

trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in note f of the consolidated financial statements in determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles the company considers the length of the lease term the truck model the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand operating lease terms generally range from three to five years the resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30 and 70 of the original equipment cost if the sales price of a truck at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the company’s estimated residual value a gain or loss will result 

future market conditions changes in government regulations and other factors outside the company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant a decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term 

during 2020 and 2019 market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally lower than the residual values on the equipment resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of 999 million and 658 million respectively 

at december 31 2020 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the financial services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the truck segment was 242 billion a 10 decrease in used truck values worldwide if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the company’s operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the company recording additional depreciation expense of approximately 807 million in 2021 706 in 2022 556 in 2023 226 in 2024 and 129 in 2025 and thereafter 

allowance for credit losses

the allowance for credit losses related to the company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in note e of the consolidated financial statements the company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments retail and wholesale the retail segment consists of retail loans and finance leases net of unearned interest the wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral the wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables and the company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets in determining the allowance for credit losses retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest generally over three to five years and they are secured by the same type of collateral the allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves 

the company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss a finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in addition all retail loans and leases which have been classified as tdrs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired generally impaired accounts are on nonaccrual status impaired accounts classified as tdrs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the company will collect all principal and interest payments

impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses the determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral when the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the company’s amortized cost basis no reserve is recorded small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss and economic forecasts information discussed below 

 

 

 

the company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired and share similar risk characteristics on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information using past due account data current market conditions and expected changes in future macroeconomic conditions that affect collectability historical credit loss information provides relevant information of expected credit losses the historical information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts repossession rates and the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse

 

the company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions a projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the company’s borrowers and their ability to repay adjustments to historical loss information are made for changes in forecasted economic conditions that are specific to the industry and markets in which the company conducts business the company utilizes economic forecasts from third party sources and determines expected losses based on historical experience under similar market conditions after determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of expected credit losses net of recoveries inherent in the portfolio

 

the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current and future market conditions as accounts become past due the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases the company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 30 and 70 over the past two years the company’s yearend 30 days past due accounts have ranged between 5 and 7 of loan and lease receivables historically a 100 basis point increase in the 30 days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 2 to 37 basis points of receivables at december 31 2020 30 days past dues were 5 if past dues were 100 basis points higher or 15 as of december 31 2020 the company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of 2 to 36 million depending on the extent of the past dues the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors 

product warranty

product warranty is disclosed in note i of the consolidated financial statements the expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims net of recoveries management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through qualityimprovement programs however actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve historically those adjustments have not been material over the past two years warranty expense as a percentage of truck parts and other net sales and revenues has ranged between 17 and 22 if the 2020 warranty expense had been 2 higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2020 warranty expense would have increased by approximately 34 million

information about the company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to items 101b c1i and d of regulation sk appears in item 8 note s of this form 10k 



paccar is a multinational company operating in three principal industry segments 







paccar’s other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches

trucks

paccar’s trucks are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia brasil canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of commercial and consumer goods the company also manufactures engines primarily for use in the company’s trucks at its facilities in columbus mississippi eindhoven the netherlands and ponta grossa brasil paccar competes in the north american class 8 market primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in chillicothe ohio denton texas renton washington mexicali mexico and ste therese canada paccar also competes in the north american class 6 to 7 markets primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada denton texas and mexicali mexico paccar competes in the european lightmedium market with daf coe trucks assembled in the united kingdom uk by leyland one of paccar’s wholly owned subsidiaries and participates in the european heavy market with daf coe trucks assembled in the netherlands and the uk paccar competes in the brazilian heavy truck market with daf models assembled at ponta grossa in the state of paraná brasil paccar competes in the australian medium and heavy truck markets with kenworth conventional and certain daf coe models assembled at its facility at bayswater in the state of victoria australia and daf coe models primarily assembled in the uk commercial truck manufacturing comprises the largest segment of paccar’s business and accounted for 78 of total 2019 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands and is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in brasil and australia the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to paccar’s truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions some manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis reflecting the similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate 

 

the company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specifications some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures paccar engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models the company also manufactures engines at its columbus mississippi facility in 2019 the company installed paccar engines in 43 of the company’s kenworth and peterbilt heavy ‑duty trucks in the us and canada and substantially all of the daf heavyduty trucks sold throughout the world engines not manufactured by the company are purchased from cummins inc cummins the company purchased a significant portion of its transmissions from eaton corporation plc eaton and zf friedrichshafen ag zf the company also purchased a significant portion of north america stampings used for cabs from magna international inc magna the company has longterm agreements with cummins eaton zf and magna to provide for continuity of supply a loss of supply from cummins eaton zf or magna and the resulting interruption in the production of trucks would have a material effect on the company’s results purchased materials and parts include raw materials partially processed materials such as castings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers raw materials partially processed materials and finished components make up approximately 85 of the cost of new trucks the value of major finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 33 in europe to approximately 86 in north america in addition to materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation property taxes and utilities the company’s cost of sales are highly correlated to sales 

the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3 of consolidated revenues in 2019 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would require the company to either contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself 

other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks are dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical based on the level of overall economic activity the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s costs for trucks consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as changes to diesel engine emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

there are four principal competitors in the us and canada commercial truck market the company’s share of the us and canadian class 8 market was 300 of retail sales in 2019 and the company’s mediumduty market share was 169 in europe there are six principal competitors in the commercial truck market including parent companies to two competitors of the company in the us in 2019 daf had a 162 share of the european heavyduty market and a 97 share of the lightmedium market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales

the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

the company’s truck products are subject to noise emission and safety regulations competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with these regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

the company had a total production backlog of 63 billion at the end of 2019 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90‑day backlog approximated 33 billion at december 31 2019 45 billion at december 31 2018 and 40 billion at december 31 2017 production of the yearend 2019 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2020

 

parts 

the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles to over 2200 kenworth peterbilt and daf dealers in 99 countries around the world aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s 18 strategically located parts distribution centers pdcs in the us canada europe australia mexico and central and south america parts are primarily purchased from various suppliers and also manufactured by the company aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery the parts segment accounted for 16 of total 2019 net sales and revenues

key factors affecting parts segment earnings include the aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks to reflect the benefit the parts segment receives from costs incurred by the truck segment certain factory overhead research and development engineering and sga expenses are allocated from the truck segment to the parts segment the company’s cost for parts sold consists primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the cost of parts sold the company maintains rigorous control of sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

financial services 

paccar financial services pfs operates in 25 countries in north america europe australia and south america through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name pfs also conducts full service leasing operations through operating divisions or wholly owned subsidiaries in north america germany and australia under the paclease trade name selected dealers in north america are franchised to provide full service leasing pfs provides its franchisees with equipment financing and administrative support pfs also operates its own full service lease outlets pfs’s retail loan and lease customers consist of small medium and large commercial trucking companies independent owneroperators and other businesses and acquire their paccar trucks principally from independent paccar dealers pfs accounted for 6 of total net sales and revenues and 57 of total assets in 2019

pfs is primarily responsible for managing the sales of the company’s used trucks the company’s financial services segment sells used trucks returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business and trucks acquired from repossessions pfs also obtains used trucks from the truck segment in trades related to new truck sales and trucks returned from residual value guarantees rvgs certain gains and losses from the sale of used trucks are shared with the truck segment the company’s financial services segment records revenue on the sale of used trucks received in trade and rvg returns

the company’s finance receivables are classified as dealer wholesale dealer retail and customer retail segments the dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to independent paccar dealers the dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises which use the proceeds to fund their customers’ acquisition of trucks and related equipment the customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for their acquisition of trucks and related equipment customer retail receivables are further segregated by fleet and owneroperator classes the fleet class consists of customers operating more than five trucks all others are considered owneroperators similar methods are employed to assess and monitor credit risk for each class

finance receivables are secured by the trucks and related equipment being financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts generally range from three to five years depending on the type and use of equipment payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one year 

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in public and private offerings and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies pfs matches the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases 

key factors affecting the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to pfs new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by kenworth peterbilt and daf and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment the company’s financial services market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market pfs’s primary competitors include commercial banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of pfs to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term pfs obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings a portion of which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interestrate contracts this enables pfs to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the acquisition cost of leased equipment the term of the leases which generally ranges from three to five years and the residual value of the leases which generally ranges from 30 to 70 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation including interest and depreciation 

pfs incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts pfs takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses

the ability of customers to pay their obligations to pfs depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel among other factors pfs limits its exposure to any one customer with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 5 of the aggregate portfolio assets pfs generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck collateral and may require other collateral or guarantees in the event of default pfs will repossess the truck and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network as well as pfs used truck centers pfs will also seek to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices pfs’s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness pfs provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the economic environment in each of its markets

financial services sga expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the loan and lease portfolios these costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend to be relatively stable

other businesses 

other businesses include the manufacturing of industrial winches in two us plants and marketing them under the braden carco and gearmatic nameplates the markets for these products are highly competitive and the company competes with a number of well established firms sales of industrial winches were less than 1 of total net sales and revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 

the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products

risk factors

tableend

the following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations

business and industry risks

commercial truck market demand is variable  the company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the company’s equipment and services the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america and europe demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors 

competition and prices the company operates in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect the company’s sales and pricing financial results depend largely on the ability to develop manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand 

production costs and supplier capacity the company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the company’s financial results or use of its production capacity many of the company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity unexpected events including natural disasters may increase the company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the company’s or its suppliers’ operations 

the recent outbreak of the coronavirus “covid19” in china has resulted in work stoppages at certain suppliers in china that are part of the company’s supply chain as of february 19 2020 the company has not experienced shortages in supply as a result of the interruptions but if the work stoppages were to be prolonged or expanded in scope there could be resulting supply shortages which could impact the company’s ability to deliver trucks and parts to customers on schedule and have an adverse effect on the company’s revenues and profits

liquidity risks credit ratings and costs of funds disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the company’s sources of liquidity or the liquidity of customers dealers and suppliers a lowering of the company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets the company’s financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt if the markets for commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s financial services segment competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values and used truck inventory values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the company’s financial services segment 

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company 

 

although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

interestrate risks the financial services segment is subject to interestrate risks because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins pfs uses derivative contracts to match the interest rate characteristics of its debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates 

information technology the company relies on information technology systems and networks to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of its business processes and activities these computer systems and networks may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures computer viruses or outside parties attempting to disrupt the company’s business or gain unauthorized access to the company’s electronic data the company maintains and continues to invest in protections to guard against such events examples of these protections include conducting thirdparty penetration tests implementing software detection and prevention tools event monitoring and disaster recoverability additionally the company maintains a cybersecurity insurance policy despite these safeguards there remains a risk of system disruptions unauthorized access and data loss 

if the company’s computer systems were to be damaged disrupted or breached it could impact data availability and integrity result in a theft of the company’s intellectual property or lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information of the company’s customers suppliers and employees security breaches could also result in a violation of us and international privacy and other laws and subject the company to various litigations and governmental proceedings these events could have an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition damage its reputation disrupt operations and negatively impact competitiveness in the marketplace

political regulatory and economic risks

multinational operations  the company’s global operations are exposed to political economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems natural calamities wars terrorism and labor strikes changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and i nternational trade policies may impact demand for the company’s products financial results and competitive position paccar’s global operations are subject to extensive trade competition and anticorruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs 

uk exit from the european union eu  the uk formally exited the eu on january 31 2020 under the withdrawal agreement between the uk and the eu there is a transition period that will last until december 31 2020 during the transition period all eu rules and regulations will continue to apply to the uk during 2020 the uk and the eu intend to conclude new agreements concerning their future relationship if no agreement is reached during the transition period and there is no mutually agreed extension of the transition period the standard trade protocols of the world trade organization wto would become effective 

 

the company manufactures medium and heavyduty daf trucks in the uk which are sold primarily in the uk and to a lesser extent in europe and other world markets in 2019 approximately 10 of the company’s worldwide truck production was manufactured in the uk in the event standard trade protocols of the wto become effective it is anticipated there would be an increase in tariffs on truck components and parts from the eu which would increase the cost of all trucks and parts in the uk the higher cost of trucks and parts may impact truck and parts sales and margins which could have an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations the company’s results could also be impacted by the uncertainty regarding timing and terms of the final agreement which could cause delays in capital investment decisions

 

libor london interbank offered rate transition certain financing provided by pfs to dealers and retail customers as well as financing extended to pfs are based on variable interest rate contracts these contracts utilize various benchmark rates including libor to establish applicable contract interest rates paccar also utilizes hedging instruments and has line of credit arrangements which reference libor including other similar benchmark rates in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of libor after 2021 at this time it is not clear if libor will continue to exist and if not what alternative benchmark rate will replace libor any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate libor exactly which could impact currently active contracts which terminate after 2021 

 

substantially all of the company’s contracts which reference libor including dealer wholesale financing contracts mediumterm notes hedging instruments and line of credit arrangements include fallback language that specifies the methods to establish contract interest rates in the absence of libor or provide for the use of an alternative benchmark rate should libor be discontinued 

 

  

the company has retail loan and lease contracts with a current balance of approximately 220 million or less than 14 of pfs assets that extend beyond 2021 and do not contain fallback language or provide for the use of an alternative benchmark rate the company will seek to amend these contracts to allow for the use of an alternative benchmark rate

 

changes to benchmark rates will have an uncertain impact on finance receivables and other financial obligations our current or future cost of funds andor access to capital markets the company will attempt to minimize the impact of differences between the current and replacement benchmark rates through pricing adjustments on the financing provided by pfs but it is not certain the company will be able to do so based on the current balance of contracts referencing libor including other similar benchmark rates it is estimated that for a 10 basis point difference between the current and replacement benchmark rates that the company is unable to recover through pricing adjustments income before income taxes would decrease by approximately 2 million accordingly the company does not expect the anticipated changes to the use of libor as a benchmark rate will have a material impact on the results of operations

environmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs the company could experience higher research and development and manufacturing costs due to changes in government requirements for its products including changes in emissions fuel greenhouse gas or other regulations 

litigation product liability and regulatory the company’s products are subject to recall for environmental performance and safetyrelated issues product recalls lawsuits regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the company establishes for contingencies may increase the company’s costs and lower profits due to the international nature of the company’s business some products are also subject to international trade regulations including customs and import  export related laws and regulations government embargoes and sanctions prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries as well as anticorruption laws the company’s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets and claims or regulatory actions even if unsuccessful or without merit could adversely affect the company’s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity

other loss income before tax was 177 million in 2019 compared to 27 million in 2018 the loss in 2019 compared to income in 2018 was primarily due to higher compensation costs lower results from the winch business and higher expected costs to resolve certain environmental matters

the company believes its cash balances and investments collections on existing finance receivables committed bank facilities and current investmentgrade credit ratings of aa1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability in the event of a decrease in the company’s credit ratings or a disruption in the financial markets the company may not be able to refinance its maturing debt in the financial markets in such circumstances the company would be exposed to liquidity risk to the degree that the timing of debt maturities differs from the timing of receivable collections from customers the company believes its various sources of liquidity including committed bank facilities would continue to provide it with sufficient funding resources to service its maturing debt obligations

 

commitments 

the following summarizes the company’s contractual cash commitments at december 31 2019 

 



 





 

total cash commitments for borrowings and interest on term debt were 1157 billion and were related to the financial services segment as described in note j of the consolidated financial statements borrowings consist primarily of term notes and commercial paper issued by the financial services segment the company expects to fund its maturing financial services debt obligations principally from funds provided by collections from customers on loans and lease contracts as well as from the proceeds of commercial paper and mediumterm note borrowings purchase obligations are the company’s contractual commitments to acquire future production inventory and capital equipment other obligations primarily include commitments to purchase energy

loan and lease commitments are for funding new retail loan and lease contracts residual value guarantees represent the company’s commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value if the customer decides to return the truck at a specified date in the future 

impact of environmental matters

the company its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment the company believes its policies practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred 

the company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters in certain of these matters the company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies the company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 were 13 million and 12 million respectively while the timing and amount of the ultimate costs associated with future environmental cleanup cannot be determined management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the companys consolidated cash flow liquidity or financial condition

 

critical accounting policies 

the company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a of the consolidated financial statements in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented the following are accounting policies which in the opinion of management are particularly sensitive and which if actual results are different from estimates used by management may have a material impact on the financial statements 

operating leases

trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in note f of the consolidated financial statements in determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles the company considers the length of the lease term the truck model the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand operating lease terms generally range from three to five years the resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30 and 70 of the original equipment cost if the sales price of a truck at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the company’s estimated residual value a gain or loss will result 

future market conditions changes in government regulations and other factors outside the company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant a decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term 

during 2019 and 2018 market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally lower than the residual values on the equipment resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of 1090 million and 457 million respectively 

at december 31 2019 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the financial services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the truck segment was 236 billion a 10 decrease in used truck values worldwide if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the company’s operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the company recording an average of approximately 67 million of additional depreciation per year

allowance for credit losses

the allowance for credit losses related to the company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in note e of the consolidated financial statements the company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments retail and wholesale the retail segment consists of retail loans and finance leases net of unearned interest the wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral the wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables and the company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets in determining the allowance for credit losses retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest generally over three to five years and they are secured by the same type of collateral the allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves 

the company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss a finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in addition all retail loans and leases which have been classified as tdrs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired generally impaired accounts are on nonaccrual status impaired accounts classified as tdrs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the company will collect all principal and interest payments

impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses the determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral when the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the company’s recorded investment no reserve is recorded small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below 

 

the company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information using past due account data and current market conditions information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts repossession rates the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse the company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions a projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the company’s borrowers and their ability to repay after determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of incurred credit losses net of recoveries inherent in the portfolio 

the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions as accounts become past due the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases the company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 30 and 70 over the past three years the company’s yearend 30 days past due accounts have ranged between 4 and 7 of loan and lease receivables historically a 100 basis point increase in the 30 days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 2 to 35 basis points of receivables at december 31 2019 30 days past dues were 7 if past dues were 100 basis points higher or 17 as of december 31 2019 the company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of 2 to 32 million depending on the extent of the past dues the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors 

product warranty

product warranty is disclosed in note i of the consolidated financial statements the expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims net of recoveries management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through qualityimprovement programs however actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve historically those adjustments have not been material over the past two years warranty expense as a percentage of truck parts and other net sales and revenues has ranged between 16 and 17 if the 2019 warranty expense had been 2 higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2019 warranty expense would have increased by approximately 48 million

currency risks  the company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations of foreign currencies particularly the canadian dollar the euro the british pound the australian dollar the brazilian real and the mexican peso see note p for additional information concerning these hedges  based on the company’s sensitivity analysis the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 unfavorable change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be a loss of 1280 related to contracts outstanding at december 31 2019 compared to a loss of 1012 at december 31 2018 these amounts would be largely offset by changes in the values of the underlying hedged exposures

paccar’s other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches

trucks

paccar’s trucks are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia brasil canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of commercial and consumer goods the company also manufactures engines primarily for use in the company’s trucks at its facilities in columbus mississippi eindhoven the netherlands and ponta grossa brasil paccar competes in the north american class 8 market primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in chillicothe ohio denton texas renton washington ste therese canada and mexicali mexico paccar also competes in the north american class 6 to 7 markets primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada and mexicali mexico paccar competes in the european lightmedium market with daf coe trucks assembled in the united kingdom uk by leyland one of paccar’s wholly owned subsidiaries and participates in the european heavy market with daf coe trucks assembled in the netherlands and the uk paccar competes in the brazilian heavy truck market with daf models assembled at ponta grossa in the state of paraná brasil paccar competes in the australian medium and heavy truck markets with kenworth conventional and certain daf coe models assembled at its facility at bayswater in the state of victoria australia and daf coe models primarily assembled in the uk commercial truck manufacturing comprises the largest segment of paccar’s business and accounted for 77 of total 2018 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands and is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in brasil and australia the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to paccar’s truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions some manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis reflecting the similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate 

 

the company’s trucks have a reputation for h igh quality products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specifications some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to b e fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers p ursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures paccar engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models the company also manufactures engines at its columbus mi ssissippi facility in 2018 the company installed paccar engines in 41 of the company’s kenworth and peterbilt heavy ‑duty trucks in the us and canada and substantially all of the daf heavyduty trucks sold throughout the world engines not manufactured by the company are purchased from cummins inc cummins the company purchased a significant portion of its transmissions from eaton corporation plc eaton and zf friedrichshafen ag zf the company also purchased a significant portion of north americ a stampings used for cabs from magna international inc magna the company has longterm agreements with cummins eaton zf and magna to provide for continuity of supply a loss of supply from cummins eaton zf or magna and the resulting interruption i n the production of trucks would have a material effect on the company’s results purchased materials and parts include raw materials partially processed materials such as castings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers raw mate rials partially processed materials and finished components make up approximately 90 of the cost of new trucks the value of major finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 30 in europe to approximately 87  in north america in addition to materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation property taxes and utilities the com pany’s cost of sales are highly correlated to sales 

the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3 of consolidated revenues in 2018 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would require the company to either contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself 

other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks are dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical based on the level of overall economic activity the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s costs for trucks consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as changes to diesel engine emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

there are four principal competitors in the us and canada commercial truck market the company’s share of the us and canadian class 8 market was 294 of retail sales in 2018 and the company’s mediumduty market share was 177 in europe there are six principal competitors in the commercial truck market including parent companies to two competitors of the company in the us in 2018 daf had a 166 share of the european heavyduty market and a 90 share of the lightmedium market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales

the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

the company’s truck products are subject to noise emission and safety regulations competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with these regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

the company had a total production backlog of 147 billion at the end of 2018 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90‑day backlog approximated 45   billion at december 31 2018 40 billion at december 31 2017 and 21 billion at december 31 2016 production of the yearend 2018 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2019

 

parts 

the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles to over 2200 kenworth peterbilt and daf dealers in 103 countries around the world aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s 18 strategically located parts distribution centers pdcs in the us canada europe australia mexico and central and south america parts are primarily purchased from various suppliers and also manufactured by the company aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery the parts segment accounted for 16 of total 2018 net sales and revenues

key factors affecting parts segment earnings include the aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks to reflect the benefit the parts segment receives from costs incurred by the truck segment certain factory overhead research and development engineering and sga expenses are allocated from the truck segment to the parts segment the company’s cost for parts sold consists primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the cost of parts sold the company maintains rigorous control of sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs

finance receivables are secured by the trucks and related equipment being financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts generally range from three to five years depending on the type and use of equipment payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one year 

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in public and private offerings and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies pfs matches the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases 

key factors affecting the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to pfs new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by kenworth peterbilt and daf and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment the company’s financial services market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market pfs’s primary competitors include commercial banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of pfs to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term pfs obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings a portion of which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interestrate contracts this enables pfs to obtain a stable spread between the 

 

cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is de preciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the acquisition cost of leased equipment the term of the leases which generally ranges from three to five years and the residual value of the leases which generally ranges from 30 to 70 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation including interest and depreciation 

pfs incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts pfs takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses

the ability of customers to pay their obligations to pfs depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel among other factors pfs limits its exposure to any one customer with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 5 of the aggregate portfolio assets pfs generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck collateral and may require other collateral or guarantees in the event of default pfs will repossess the truck and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network as well as pfs used truck centers pfs will also seek to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices pfs’s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness pfs provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the economic environment in each of its markets

financial services sga expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the loan and lease portfolios these costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend to be relatively stable

 item 1a 

risk factors

tableend

the following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations

business and industry risks

commercial truck market demand is variable  the company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the company’s equipment and services the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america and europe demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors 

competition and prices the company operates in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect the company’s sales and pricing financial results depend largely on the ability to develop manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand 

production costs and supplier capacity the company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the company’s financial results or use of its production capacity many of the company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity unexpected events including natural disasters may increase the company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the company’s or its suppliers’ operations 

liquidity risks credit ratings and costs of funds disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the company’s sources of liquidity or the liquidity of customers dealers and suppliers a lowering of the company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets the company’s financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt if the markets for commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s financial services segment competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the company’s financial services segment 

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

interestrate risks the financial services segment is subject to interestrate risks because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins pfs uses derivative contracts to match the interest rate characteristics of its debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates 

 

information technology the company relies on information technology systems a nd networks to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of its business processes and activities these computer systems and networks may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing s oftware databases or components power outages hardware failures computer viruses or outside parties attempting to disrupt the company’s business or gain unauthorized access to the company’s electronic data the company maintains and continues to inves t in protections to guard against such events examples of these protections include conducting thirdparty penetration tests implementing software detection and prevention tools event monitoring and disaster recoverability additionally the company mai ntains a cybersecurity insurance policy despite these safeguards there remains a risk of system disruptions unauthorized access and data loss 

if the company’s computer systems were to be damaged disrupted or breached it could impact data availability and integrity result in a theft of the company’s intellectual property or lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information of the company’s customers suppliers and employees security breaches could also result in a violation of us and international privacy and other laws and subject the company to various litigations and governmental proceedings these events could have an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition damage its reputation disrupt operations and negatively impact competitiveness in the marketplace

political regulatory and economic risks

multinational operations  the company’s global operations are exposed to political economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems natural calamities wars terrorism and labor strikes changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and i nternational trade policies may impact demand for the company’s products financial results and competitive position paccar’s global operations are subject to extensive trade competition and anticorruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs 

uk exit from the european union  in march 2017 the united kingdom uk invoked article 50 of their treaty with the european union signaling their intent to leave the eu under the eu treaty the uk had two years to negotiate terms of their exit with the eu although a preliminary agreement between the eu and the uk government was made it was not ratified by the uk parliament if the terms of the exit from the eu are not agreed by march 29 2019 it is anticipated that the standard trade protocols of the world trade organization wto would become effective “hard brexit” 

the company manufactures medium and heavyduty daf trucks in the uk which are sold primarily in the uk and to a lesser extent in europe and other world markets in 2018 approximately 10 of the company’s worldwide truck production was manufactured in the uk most of the truck components used in the manufacturing of trucks in the uk as well as aftermarket parts are sourced from the eu in the event of a hard brexit it is anticipated that there would be an increase in tariffs from truck components and parts from the eu which would increase the cost of all trucks and parts in the uk it is expected that there would also be an increase in tariffs on trucks sold from the uk to the eu which would lead to higher costs for trucks imported from the uk into the eu the imposition of tariffs and border controls would most likely lead to longer lead times in the supply chain from the eu and the uk in the event of a hard brexit the company anticipates that after a period of time changes would be made to the supply chain to minimize the effects of tariffs and delays the higher cost of trucks and parts may impact manufacturing and parts sales and margins which could have an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations

environmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs the company could experience higher research and development and manufacturing costs due to changes in government requirements for its products including changes in emissions fuel greenhouse gas or other regulations 

litigation product liability and regulatory the company’s products are subject to recall for environmental performance and safetyrelated issues product recalls lawsuits regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the company establishes for contingencies may increase the company’s costs and lower profits due to the international nature of the company’s business some products are also subject to international trade regulations including customs and import  export related laws and regulations government embargoes and sanctions prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries as well as anticorruption laws the company’s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets and claims or regulatory actions even if unsuccessful or without merit could adversely affect the company’s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity 

currency exchange and translation the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the company’s assets liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk  as reported in the company’s financial statements the company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce but not eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

 

accounting estimates in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions th at affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented certain of these estimates judgments and assumptions such as residual values on operating leases the allowance for credit losses and produc t warranty are particularly sensitive if actual results are different from estimates used by management they may have a material impact on the financial statements for additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates see “critical accounting polic ies” under item 7 of this form 10k 

taxes changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the company operates impact the company’s effective tax rate changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the company’s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities

the provision for losses on receivables was 165 million in 2018 compared to 223 million in 2017 reflecting continued good portfolio performance the lower provision for losses on receivables in europe primarily reflects higher recoveries on chargedoff accounts

the company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its financial services operations the company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some shortterm financial stress but not considered to be in financial difficulty modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty the company’s modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification when considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons the company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the company considers likely to perform under the modified terms when the company modifies a loan or finance lease for credit reasons and grants a concession the modification is classified as a troubled debt restructuring tdr

 

the postmodification balance of accounts modified during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 are summarized below 

 



 



in 2018 total modification activity decreased compared to 2017 reflecting lower modifications for insignificant delays credit – no concession and credit  tdrs partially offset by higher commercial modifications the increase in modifications for commercial reasons primarily reflects higher volumes of refinancing the decrease in modifications for insignificant delay reflects fewer fleet customers requesting payment relief for up to three months the decrease in modifications for credit  no concession is primarily due to lower volumes of refinancing for customers in financial difficulty credit  tdr modifications decreased to 131 million in 2018 from 205 million in 2017 mainly due to the contract modifications for two fleet customers in 2017 

the following table summarizes the company’s 30 days past due accounts

 



 

accounts 30 days past due were 4 at december 31 2018 and 5 at december 31 2017 lower past dues in the us and canada were partially offset by higher past dues in europe and mexico the company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances

when the company modifies a 30 days past due account the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms the company modified 72 million and 6 million of accounts worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017 respectively which were 30 days past due and became current at the time of modification had these accounts not been modified and continued to not make payments the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30 days past due would have been as follows

 



 

modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at december 31 2018 and 2017 the effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at december 31 2018 and 2017

income taxes

in 2017 the effective tax rate was 229 compared to 538 in 2016 the lower rate is due to the 2017 onetime impact from the change in us tax law as explained below and the unfavorable 2016 impact of the onetime nondeductible expense of 8330 million for the ec charge

on december 22 2017 the us enacted new federal income tax legislation the tax cuts and jobs act “the tax act” the tax act lowered the us statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 imposed a onetime transition tax on the company’s foreign earnings which previously had been deferred from us income tax and created a modified territorial system as a result the company recorded a provisional amount of 3040 million of deferred tax benefits due to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities at the new lower statutory tax rate in addition the company recorded a provisional amount of 1306 million of tax expense on the company’s foreign earnings which previously had been deferred from us income tax

impact of environmental matters

the company its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment the company believes its policies practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred 

the company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters in certain of these matters the company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies the company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 were 12 million 19 million and 22 million respectively while the timing and amount of the ultimate costs associated with future environmental cleanup cannot be determined management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the companys consolidated cash flow liquidity or financial condition

 

critical accounting policies 

the company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a of the consolidated financial statements in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented the following are accounting policies which in the opinion of management are particularly sensitive and which if actual results are different from estimates used by management may have a material impact on the financial statements 

operating leases

trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in note f of the consolidated financial statements in determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles the company considers the length of the lease term the truck model the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand operating lease terms generally range from three to five years the resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30 and 70 of original equipment cost if the sales price of the trucks at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the company’s estimated residual value a gain or loss will result 

future market conditions changes in government regulations and other factors outside the company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant a decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term 

during 2018 2017 and 2016 market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally lower than the residual values on the equipment resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of 310 million 455 million and 96 million respectively 

at december 31 2018 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the financial services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the truck segment was 241 billion a 10 decrease in used truck values worldwide if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the company’s operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the company recording an average of approximately 69 million of additional depreciation per year

allowance for credit losses

the allowance for credit losses related to the company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in note e of the consolidated financial statements the company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments retail and wholesale the retail segment consists of retail loans and direct and salestype finance leases net of unearned interest the wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral the wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables and the company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets in determining the allowance for credit losses retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest generally over three to five years and they are secured by the same type of collateral the allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves 

the company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss a finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in addition all retail loans and leases which have been classified as tdrs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired generally impaired accounts are on nonaccrual status impaired accounts classified as tdrs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the company will collect all principal and interest payments

impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses the determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral when the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the company’s recorded investment no reserve is recorded small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below 

 

the company evaluates finance receivables that a re not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information using past due account data and current market conditions information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts repossession rates the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse the company has develop ed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions a projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses in herent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the company’s borrowers and their ability to repay after determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of incurred credit losses net of recoveries inherent in the portfolio 

the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions as accounts become past due the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases the company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 30 and 70 over the past three years the company’s yearend 30 days past due accounts have ranged between 4 and 5 of loan and lease receivables historically a 100 basis point increase in the 30 days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 3 to 39 basis points of receivables at december 31 2018 30 days past dues were 4 if past dues were 100 basis points higher or 14 as of december 31 2018 the company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of 2 to 33 million depending on the extent of the past dues the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors 

product warranty

product warranty is disclosed in note i of the consolidated financial statements the expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims net of recoveries management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through qualityimprovement programs however actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve historically those adjustments have not been material over the past three years warranty expense as a percentage of truck parts and other net sales and revenues has ranged between 13 and 16 if the 2018 warranty expense had been 2 higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2018 warranty expense would have increased by approximately 443 million

interestrate risks  see note p for a description of the company’s hedging programs and exposure to interest rate fluctuations the company measures its interestrate risk by estimating the amount by which the fair value of interestrate sensitive assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments would change assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase across the yield curve as shown in the following table 

 



 

currency risks  the company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations of foreign currencies particularly the canadian dollar the euro the british pound the australian dollar the brazilian real and the mexican peso see note p for additional information concerning these hedges  based on the company’s sensitivity analysis the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 unfavorable change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be a loss of 1012 related to contracts outstanding at december 31 2018 compared to a loss of 557 at december 31 2017 these amounts would be largely offset by changes in the values of the underlying hedged exposures

paccar inc the company or paccar incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1971 is the successor to pacific car and foundry company which was incorporated in washington in 1924 the company traces its predecessors to seattle car manufacturing company formed in 1905 



information about the company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to items 101b c1i and d of regulation sk appears in item 8 note r of this form 10k 



paccar is a multinational company operating in three principal industry segments 







paccar’s other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches

trucks

paccar’s trucks are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia brasil canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of commercial and consumer goods the company also manufactures engines primarily for use in the company’s trucks at its facilities in columbus mississippi eindhoven the netherlands and ponta grossa brasil paccar competes in the north american class 8 market primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in chillicothe ohio denton texas renton washington ste therese canada and mexicali mexico paccar also competes in the north american class 6 to 7 markets primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada and mexicali mexico paccar competes in the european lightmedium market with daf coe trucks assembled in the united kingdom uk by leyland one of paccar’s wholly owned subsidiaries and participates in the european heavy market with daf coe trucks assembled in the netherlands and the uk paccar competes in the brazilian heavy truck market with daf models assembled at ponta grossa in the state of paraná brasil paccar competes in the australian light and heavy truck markets with kenworth conventional and coe models assembled at its facility at bayswater in the state of victoria australia and daf coe models assembled in the uk commercial truck manufacturing comprises the largest segment of paccar’s business and accounted for 76 of total 2017 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands and is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in brasil and australia the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to paccar’s truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions some manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis reflecting the similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate 

 

the company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality and are essentially custom products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specifications some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers wh o require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial perc entage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures paccar engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heav y truck models the company also manufactures engines at its columbus mississippi facility in 2017 the company installed paccar engines in 41 of the company’s kenworth and peterbilt heavy ‑duty trucks in the us and canada and substantially all of th e daf heavyduty trucks sold throughout the world engines not manufactured by the company are purchase d from cummins inc cummins the company purchased a significant portion of its transmissions from eaton corporation plc eaton and zf friedrichshaf en ag zf the company also purchased a significant portion of north america stampings used for cabs from magna international inc magna the company has longterm agr eements with cummins eaton zf and magna to provide fo r continuity of supply a loss o f supply from cummins eaton zf or magna and the resulting interruption in the production of trucks would have a material effect on the company’s results purchased materials and parts include raw materials partially processed materials such as cast ings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers raw materials partially processed materials and finished components make up approximately 90 of the cost of new trucks the value of major finished truck components manufactured by in dependent suppliers ranges from approximately 34 in europe to approximately 87 in north america in addition to materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain f actory overhead costs such as depreciation property taxes and utilities the company’s cost of sales are highly correlated to sales 

the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3 of consolidated revenues in 2017 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would require the company to either contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself 

other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products no significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2017 manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks are dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical based on the level of overall economic activity the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s costs for trucks consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as changes to diesel engine emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

there are four principal competitors in the us and canada commercial truck market the company’s share of the us and canadian class 8 market was a record 307 of retail sales in 2017 and the company’s mediumduty market share was 171 in europe there are six principal competitors in the commercial truck market including parent companies to two competitors of the company in the us in 2017 daf had a 153 share of the european heavyduty market and a 105 share of the lightmedium market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales

the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

the company’s truck products are subject to noise emission and safety regulations competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with these regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

the company had a total production backlog of 64 billion at the end of 2017 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90‑day backlog approximated 40 billion at december 31 2017 21 billion at december 31 2016 and 28 billion at december 31 2015 production of the yearend 2017 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2018

 

parts 

the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles to over 2100 kenworth peterbilt and daf dealers in 101 countries around the world aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s 18 strategically located parts distribution centers pdcs in the us canada europe australia mexico and central and south america parts are primarily purchased from various suppliers and also manufactured by the company aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery the parts segment accounted for 17 of total 2017 net sales and revenues

key factors affecting parts segment earnings include the aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks to reflect the benefit the parts segment receives from costs incurred by the truck segment certain factory overhead research and development engineering and sga expenses are allocated from the truck segment to the parts segment the company’s cost for parts sold consists primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the cost of parts sold the company maintains rigorous control of sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

financial services 

paccar financial services pfs operates in 24 countries in north america europe australia and south america through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name pfs also conducts full service leasing operations through operating divisions or wholly owned subsidiaries in north america germany and australia under the paclease trade name selected dealers in north america are franchised to provide full service leasing pfs provides its franchisees with equipment financing and administrative support pfs also operates its own full service lease outlets pfs’s retail loan and lease customers consist of small medium and large commercial trucking companies independent owneroperators and other businesses and acquire their paccar trucks principally from independent paccar dealers pfs accounted for 7 of total net sales and revenues and 56 of total assets in 2017

the company’s finance receivables are classified as dealer wholesale dealer retail and customer retail segments the dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to independent paccar dealers the dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises which use the proceeds to fund their customers’ acquisition of trucks and related equipment the customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for their acquisition of trucks and related equipment customer retail receivables are further segregated by fleet and owneroperator classes the fleet class consists of customers operating more than five trucks all others are considered owneroperators similar methods are employed to assess and monitor credit risk for each class

finance receivables are secured by the trucks and related equipment being financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts generally range from three to five years depending on the type and use of equipment payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one year 

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in public and private offerings and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies pfs attempts to match the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases 

key factors affecting the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to pfs new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by kenworth peterbilt and daf and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment the company’s financial services market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market pfs’s primary competitors include commercial banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of pfs to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term pfs obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings a portion of which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interestrate contracts this enables pfs to obtain a stable spread between the 

 

cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the acquisition cost of leased e quipment the term of the leases which generally ranges from three to five years and the residual value of the leases which generally ranges from 30 to 60 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the d irect costs of operation including interest and depreciation 

pfs incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts pfs takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses

the ability of customers to pay their obligations to pfs depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel among other factors pfs limits its exposure to any one customer with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 5 of the aggregate portfolio assets pfs generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck collateral and may require other collateral or guarantees in the event of default pfs will repossess the truck and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network as well as pfs used truck centers pfs will also seek to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices pfs’s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness pfs provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the economic environment in each of its markets

financial services sga expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the loan and lease portfolios these costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend to be relatively stable

other businesses 

other businesses include the manufacturing of industrial winches in two us plants and marketing them under the braden carco and gearmatic nameplates the markets for these products are highly competitive and the company competes with a number of well established firms sales of industrial winches were less than 1 of total net sales and revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 

the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products

 item 1a 

risk factors

tableend

the following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations

business and industry risks

commercial truck market demand is variable  the company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the company’s equipment and services the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america and europe demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors 

competition and prices the company operates in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect the company’s sales and pricing   financial results depend largely on the ability to develop manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand   

production costs and supplier capacity the company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the company’s financial results or use of its production capacity many of the company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity unexpected events including natural disasters may increase the company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the company’s or its suppliers’ operations 

liquidity risks credit ratings and costs of funds disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the company’s sources of liquidity or the liquidity of customers dealers and suppliers a lowering of the company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets the company’s financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt if the markets for commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s financial services segment competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the company’s financial services segment 

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

interestrate risks the financial services segment is subject to interestrate risks because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins   pfs uses derivative contracts to match the interest rate characteristics of its debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates 

 

information technology the company relies on information technology systems including the internet and other computer systems which may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing s oftware databases or components power outages hardware failures computer viruses or outside parties attempting to disrupt the company’s business or gain unauthorized access to the company’s electronic data the company maintains protections to guard against such events if the company’s computer systems were to be damaged disrupted or breached it could result in a negative impact on the company’s operating results and could also cause reputational damage business disruption or the disclosure of co nfidential data 

political regulatory and economic risks

multinational operations  the company’s global operations are exposed to political economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems natural calamities wars terrorism and labor strikes   changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and i nternational trade policies may impact demand for the company’s products financial results and competitive position paccar’s global operations are subject to extensive trade competition and anticorruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs 

environmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs the company could experience higher research and development and manufacturing costs due to changes in government requirements for its products including changes in emissions fuel greenhouse gas or other regulations 

litigation product liability and regulatory the company’s products are subject to recall for environmental performance and safetyrelated issues product recalls lawsuits regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the company establishes for contingencies may increase the company’s costs and lower profits due to the international nature of the company’s business some products are also subject to international trade regulations including customs and import  export related laws and regulations government embargoes and sanctions prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries as well as anticorruption laws the company’s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets and claims or regulatory actions even if unsuccessful or without merit could adversely affect the company’s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity 

currency exchange and translation the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries   currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the company’s assets liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk  as reported in the company’s financial statements the company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce but not eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

accounting estimates in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented certain of these estimates judgments and assumptions such as residual values on operating leases the allowance for credit losses warranty and the provision for income taxes are particularly sensitive if actual results are different from estimates used by management they may have a material impact on the financial statements for additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates see “critical accounting policies” under item 7 of this form 10k 

taxes changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the company operates impact the company’s effective tax rate changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the company’s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities

in november 2015 the company’s us finance subsidiary paccar financial corp pfc filed a shelf registration under the securities act of 1933 the total amount of mediumterm notes outstanding for pf c as of december 31 2017 was 445 billion the registration expires in november 2018 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period pfc intends to renew the registration in 2018 

as of december 31 2017 the company’s european finance subsidiary paccar financial europe had €134 billion available for issuance under a €250 billion mediumterm note program listed on the professional securities market of the london stock exchange this program replaced an expiring program in the second quarter of 2017 and is renewable annually through the filing of new listing particulars

in april 2016 paccar financial mexico registered a 1000 billion peso mediumterm note and commercial paper program with the comision nacional bancaria y de valores the registration expires in april 2021 and limits the amount of commercial paper up to one year to 500 billion pesos at december 31 2017 625 billion pesos were available for issuance 

in the event of a future significant disruption in the financial markets the company may not be able to issue replacement commercial paper as a result the company is exposed to liquidity risk from the shorter maturity of shortterm borrowings paid to lenders compared to the longer timing of receivable collections from customers the company believes its cash balances and investments collections on existing finance receivables syndicated bank lines and current investmentgrade credit ratings of aa1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability a decrease in these credit ratings could negatively impact the company’s ability to access capital markets at competitive interest rates and the company’s ability to maintain liquidity and financial stability paccar believes its financial services companies will be able to continue funding receivables servicing debt and paying dividends through internally generated funds access to public and private debt markets and lines of credit

reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures

this form 10k includes “adjusted net income nongaap” and “adjusted net income per diluted share nongaap” which are financial measures that are not in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” since they exclude the onetime tax benefit from the tax cuts and jobs act “the tax act” in 2017 and the nonrecurring european commission charge in 2016 these measures differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled nongaap financial measures used by other companies in addition the form 10k includes the financial ratios noted below calculated based on nongaap measures

management utilizes these nongaap measures to evaluate the company’s performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding significant nonrecurring items that are not representative of underlying operating trends

impact of environmental matters

the company its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment the company believes its policies practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred 

the company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters in certain of these matters the company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies the company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 were 19 million 22 million and 20 million respectively management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the companys consolidated cash flow liquidity or financial condition

 

critical accounting policies 

the company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a of the consolidated financial statements in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented the following are accounting policies which in the opinion of management are particularly sensitive and which if actual results are different from estimates used by management may have a material impact on the financial statements 

operating leases

trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in note e of the consolidated financial statements in determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles the company considers the length of the lease term the truck model the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand operating lease terms generally range from three to five years the resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30 and 60 of original equipment cost if the sales price of the trucks at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the company’s estimated residual value a gain or loss will result 

future market conditions changes in government regulations and other factors outside the company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant a decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term 

during 2017 market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity decreased resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of 412 million during 2016 market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity decreased resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of 96 million during 2015 market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally higher than the residual values on the equipment resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense of 58 million 

at december 31 2017 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the financial services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the truck segment was 273 billion a 10 decrease in used truck values worldwide if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the company’s operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the company recording an average of approximately 781 million of additional depreciation per year

allowance for credit losses

the allowance for credit losses related to the company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in note d of the consolidated financial statements the company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments retail and wholesale the retail segment consists of retail loans and direct and salestype finance leases net of unearned interest the wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral the wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables and the company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets in determining the allowance for credit losses retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest generally over three to five years and they are secured by the same type of collateral the allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves 

the company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss a finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in addition all retail loans and leases which have been classified as tdrs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired generally impaired accounts are on nonaccrual status impaired accounts classified as tdrs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the company will collect all principal and interest payments

impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses the determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral when the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the company’s recorded investment no reserve is recorded small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below 

 

the company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss informat ion using past due account data and current market conditions information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts repossession rates the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used tr uck values and other pledged collateral or recourse the company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck marke t conditions a projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the company’s borrowe rs and their ability to repay after determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of incurred credit losses net of r ecoveries inherent in the portfolio 

the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions as accounts become past due the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases the company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 30 and 80 over the past three years the company’s yearend 30 days past due accounts were 05 of loan and lease receivables historically a 100 basis point increase in the 30 days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 8 to 38 basis points of receivables at december 31 2017 30 days past dues were 05 if past dues were 100 basis points higher or 15 as of december 31 2017 the company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of 6 to 30 million depending on the extent of the past dues the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors 

product warranty

product warranty is disclosed in note h of the consolidated financial statements the expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims net of recoveries management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through qualityimprovement programs however actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve historically those adjustments have not been material over the past three years warranty expense as a percentage of truck parts and other net sales and revenues has ranged between 13 and 14 if the 2017 warranty expense had been 2 higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2017 warranty expense would have increased by approximately 36 million 

income taxes 

income taxes are disclosed in note m of the consolidated financial statements the company calculates income tax expense on pretax income based on current tax law deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences on temporary differences between recorded amounts in the financial statements and their respective tax basis the determination of income tax expense requires management estimates and judgement regarding the future outcomes of tax law issues included in tax returns and jurisdictional mix of earnings the company updates its assumptions on all of these factors each quarter as well as new information on tax laws and differences between estimated taxes and actual returns when filed if the company’s assessment of these matters changes the effect is accounted for in earnings in the period the change is made

 paccar inc the company or paccar incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1971 is the successor to pacific car and foundry company which was incorporated in washington in 1924 the company traces its predecessors to seattle car manufacturing company formed in 1905 

 

 information about the company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to items 101b c1i and d of regulation sk appears in item 8 note r of this form 10k 

 

 paccar is a multinational company operating in three principal industry segments 

 

  

  

 paccar’s other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches 

trucks 

paccar’s trucks are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia brasil canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of commercial and consumer goods the company also manufactures engines primarily for use in the company’s trucks at its facilities in columbus mississippi eindhoven the netherlands and ponta grossa brasil paccar competes in the north american class 8 market primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in chillicothe ohio denton texas renton washington ste therese canada and mexicali mexico paccar also competes in the north american class 6 to 7 markets primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada and in mexicali mexico paccar competes in the european lightmedium market with daf coe trucks assembled in the united kingdom uk by leyland one of paccar’s wholly owned subsidiaries and participates in the european heavy market with daf coe trucks assembled in the netherlands and the uk paccar competes in the brazilian heavy truck market with daf models assembled at ponta grossa in the state of paraná brasil paccar competes in the australian light and heavy truck markets with kenworth conventional and coe models assembled at its facility at bayswater in the state of victoria australia and daf coe models assembled in the uk commercial truck manufacturing comprises the largest segment of paccar’s business and accounts for 75 of total 2016 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands and is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in brasil and australia the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to paccar’s truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

  

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions some manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis reflecting the similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate 

the company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality and are essentially custom products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specification some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures paccar engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models the company also manufactures engines at its columbus mississippi facility in 2016 the company installed paccar engines in 47 of the company’s kenworth and peterbilt heavyduty trucks in the us and canada and substantially all of the daf heavyduty trucks sold throughout the world engines not manufactured by the company are purchased from cummins inc cummins the company purchased a significant portion of its transmissions from eaton corporation plc eaton and zf friedrichshafen ag zf the company has longterm agreements with cummins eaton and zf to provide for continuity of supply a loss of supply from cummins eaton or zf and the resulting interruption in the production of trucks would have a material effect on the company’s results purchased materials and parts include raw materials partially processed materials such as castings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers raw materials partially processed materials and finished components make up approximately 90 of the cost of new trucks the value of major finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 33 in europe to approximately 85 in north america in addition to materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation property taxes and utilities the company’s cost of sales are highly correlated to sales 

the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 4 of consolidated revenues in 2016 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would either require the company to contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself 

other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products no significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2016 manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks are dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical based on the level of overall economic activity the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s costs for trucks consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as the periodic need to meet diesel engine emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

there are four principal competitors in the us and canada commercial truck market the company’s share of the us and canadian class 8 market was 285 of retail sales in 2016 and the company’s mediumduty market share was 162 in europe there are six principal competitors in the commercial truck market including parent companies to two competitors of the company in the us in 2016 daf had a 155 share of the european heavyduty market and a 101 share of the lightmedium market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales 

the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

  

the company’s truck products are subject to noise emission and safety regulations competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with these regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

the company had a total production backlog of 48 billion at the end of 2016 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90day backlog approximated 21 billion at december 31 2016 28 billion at december 31 2015 and 31 billion at december 31 2014 production of the yearend 2016 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2017 

parts 

the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles to over 2100 kenworth peterbilt and daf dealers in 98 countries around the world aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s 17 strategically located parts distribution centers pdcs located in the us canada europe australia mexico and south america parts are primarily purchased from various suppliers and also manufactured by the company aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery the parts segment accounted for 18 of total 2016 net sales and revenues 

paccar’s new 160000 squarefoot pdc in renton washington opened in the second quarter of 2016 the new facility increased the distribution capacity for the company’s dealers and customers in the northwestern us and western canada 

key factors affecting parts segment earnings include the aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks to reflect the benefit the parts segment receives from costs incurred by the truck segment certain factory overhead research and development engineering and sga expenses are allocated from the truck segment to the parts segment the company’s cost for parts sold consists primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the cost of parts sold the company maintains rigorous control of sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

financial services 

paccar financial services pfs operates in 23 countries in north america europe australia and south america through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name pfs also conducts full service leasing operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in north america germany and australia under the paclease trade name selected dealers in north america are franchised to provide full service leasing pfs provides its franchisees with equipment financing and administrative support pfs also operates its own full service lease outlets pfs’s retail loan and lease customers consist of small medium and large commercial trucking companies independent owneroperators and other businesses and acquire their paccar trucks principally from independent paccar dealers pfs accounted for 7 of total net sales and revenues and 59 of total assets in 2016 

the company’s finance receivables are classified as dealer wholesale dealer retail and customer retail segments the dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to independent paccar dealers the dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises which use the proceeds to fund their customers’ acquisition of trucks and related equipment the customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for their acquisition of trucks and related equipment customer retail receivables are further segregated by fleet and owneroperator classes the fleet class consists of customers operating more than five trucks all others are considered owneroperators similar methods are employed to assess and monitor credit risk for each class 

finance receivables are secured by the trucks and related equipment being financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts generally range from three to five years depending on the type and use of equipment payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one year 

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in public and private offerings and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies pfs attempts to match the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases 

  

key factors affecting the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to pfs new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by kenworth peterbilt and daf and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment the company’s financial services market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market pfs’s primary competitors include commercial banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of pfs to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term pfs obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings a portion of which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interestrate contracts this enables pfs to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the acquisition cost of leased equipment the term of the leases which generally ranges from three to five years and the residual value of the leases which generally ranges from 30 to 60 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation including interest and depreciation 

pfs incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts pfs takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses 

the ability of customers to pay their obligations to pfs depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel among other factors pfs limits its exposure to any one customer with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 5 of the aggregate portfolio assets pfs generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck collateral and may require other collateral or guarantees in the event of default pfs will repossess the truck and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network pfs will also seek to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices pfs’s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness pfs provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the economic environment in each of its markets 

financial services sga expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the loan and lease portfolios these costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend to be relatively stable 

other businesses 

other businesses include a division of the company which manufactures industrial winches in two us plants and markets them under the braden carco and gearmatic nameplates the markets for these products are highly competitive and the company competes with a number of well established firms sales of industrial winches were less than 1 of total net sales and revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 

the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products 

patents 

the company owns numerous patents which relate to all product lines although these patents are considered important to the overall conduct of the company’s business no patent or group of patents is considered essential to a material part of the company’s business

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

business and industry risks 

commercial truck market demand is variable  the company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the company’s equipment and services the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america and europe demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors 

competition and prices the company operates in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect the company’s sales and pricing financial results depend largely on the ability to develop manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand 

production costs and supplier capacity the company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the company’s financial results or use of its production capacity many of the company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity unexpected events including natural disasters may increase the company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the company’s or its suppliers’ operations 

liquidity risks credit ratings and costs of funds disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the company’s sources of liquidity or the liquidity of customers dealers and suppliers a lowering of the company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets the company’s financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt if the markets for commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s financial services segment competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the company’s financial services segment 

  

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

interestrate risks the financial services segment is subject to interestrate risks because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins pfs uses derivative contracts to match the interest rate characteristics of its debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates 

litigation product liability and regulatory actions on july 19 2016 the european commission ec concluded its investigation of all major european truck manufacturers and reached a settlement with daf following the settlement claims and a petition to certify a claim as a class action have been filed against daf and other truck manufacturers others may bring ecrelated claims against the company or its subsidiaries while the company believes it has meritorious defenses such claims will likely take a significant period of time to resolve an adverse outcome of such proceedings could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations the company’s products are subject to recall for environmental performance and safetyrelated issues product recalls lawsuits regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the company establishes for contingencies may increase the company’s costs and lower profits the company’s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets and claims or regulatory actions even if unsuccessful or without merit could adversely affect the company’s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity 

information technology the company relies on information technology systems including the internet and other computer systems which may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures computer viruses or outside parties attempting to disrupt the company’s business or gain unauthorized access to the company’s electronic data the company maintains protections to guard against such events if the company’s computer systems were to be damaged disrupted or breached it could result in a negative impact on the company’s operating results and could also cause reputational damage business disruption or the disclosure of confidential data 

political regulatory and economic risks 

multinational operations the company’s global operations are exposed to political economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems natural calamities wars terrorism and labor strikes changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and international trade policies may impact demand for the company’s products financial results and competitive position paccar’s global operations are subject to extensive trade competition and anticorruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs 

environmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs the company could experience higher research and development and manufacturing costs due to changes in government requirements for its products including changes in emissions fuel greenhouse gas or other regulations 

currency exchange and translation the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the company’s assets liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk as reported in the company’s financial statements the company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce but not eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

  

accounting estimates in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented certain of these estimates judgments and assumptions such as residual values on operating leases the allowance for credit losses warranty and pension expenses and the provision for income taxes are particularly sensitive if actual results are different from estimates used by management they may have a material impact on the financial statements for additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates see “critical accounting policies” under item 7 of this form 10k 

taxes changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the company operates impact the company’s effective tax rate changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the company’s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities

financing activities  cash used in financing activities was 8235 million in 2016 compared to cash used in financing activities of 1965 million in 2015 the company paid 8293 million in dividends in 2016 compared to 6805 million in 2015 the increase of 1488 million was primarily due to an increase for the 2015 special dividend paid in january 2016 in 2016 the company issued 199 billion of term debt repaid term debt of 163 billion and reduced its outstanding commercial paper and shortterm bank loans by 3228 million in 2015 the company issued 199 billion of term debt increased its outstanding commercial paper and shortterm bank loans by 2507 million and repaid term debt of 158 billion this resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of 469 million in 2016 6169 million lower than the cash provided by borrowing activities of 6638 million in 2015 the company repurchased 14 million shares of common stock for 705 million in 2016 compared to 38 million shares for 2016 million in 2015 a decline of 1311 million

investing activities cash used in investing activities of 197 billion in 2015 increased 4430 million from the 153 billion used in 2014 primarily due to higher cash used in the acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of 1994 million 1697 million higher net purchases of marketable securities and 1160 million in higher net originations of retail loans and direct financing leases in 2015 these outflows were partially offset by higher proceeds from asset disposals of 533 million

credit lines and other 

the company has line of credit arrangements of 343 billion of which 322 billion were unused at december 31 2016 included in these arrangements are 30 billion of syndicated bank facilities of which 10 billion expires in june 2017 10 billion expires in june 2020 and 10 billion expires in june 2021 the company intends to replace these credit facilities on or before expiration with facilities of similar amounts and duration these credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing mediumterm notes there were no borrowings under the syndicated bank facilities for the year ended december 31 2016 

on september 23 2015 paccar’s board of directors approved the repurchase of up to 3000 million of the company’s common stock and as of december 31 2016 2067 million of shares have been repurchased pursuant to the 2015 authorization 

  

at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 the company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of 133 billion and 182 billion respectively which are considered indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries the company periodically repatriates foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to the us parent were 33 billion 24 billion and 24 billion in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the company believes that its us cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities future operating cash flow and access to the capital markets along with periodic repatriation of foreign earnings will be sufficient to meet us liquidity requirements 

truck parts and other 

the company provides funding for working capital capital expenditures rd dividends stock repurchases and other business initiatives and commitments primarily from cash provided by operations management expects this method of funding to continue in the future on july 19 2016 the ec concluded its investigation of all major european truck manufacturers and reached a settlement with daf under which the ec imposed a fine on daf of €7527 million 8330 million for infringement of european union competition rules the fine is not tax deductible in august 2016 daf paid the fine 

investments for property plant and equipment in 2016 increased to 3946 million from 3065 million in 2015 reflecting additional investments for the construction of a new daf cab paint facility in europe the peterbilt plant expansion in denton texas and a new pdc in renton washington over the past decade the company’s combined investments in worldwide capital projects and rd totaled 609 billion and have significantly increased the operating capacity and efficiency of its facilities and enhanced the quality and operating efficiency of the company’s premium products 

in 2017 capital investments are expected to be 375 to 425 million and rd is expected to be 250 to 280 million the company is investing for future growth in paccar’s new truck models integrated powertrain advanced driver assistance and truck connectivity technologies and additional capacity and operating efficiency of the company’s manufacturing and parts distribution facilities 

the company conducts business in certain countries which have been experiencing or may experience significant financial stress fiscal or political strain and are subject to the corresponding potential for default the company routinely monitors its financial exposure to global financial conditions global counterparties and operating environments as of december 31 2016 the company’s exposures in such countries were insignificant 

financial services 

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in the public markets and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies 

the company issues commercial paper for a portion of its funding in its financial services segment some of this commercial paper is converted to fixed interest rate debt through the use of interestrate swaps which are used to manage interestrate risk 

in november 2015 the company’s us finance subsidiary paccar financial corp pfc filed a shelf registration under the securities act of 1933 the total amount of mediumterm notes outstanding for pfc as of december 31 2016 was 475 billion the registration expires in november 2018 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period 

as of december 31 2016 the company’s european finance subsidiary paccar financial europe had €13134 million available for issuance under a €250 billion mediumterm note program listed on the professional securities market of the london stock exchange this program replaced an expiring program in the second quarter of 2016 and is renewable annually through the filing of new listing particulars 

in april 2016 paccar financial mexico registered a 1000 billion peso mediumterm note and commercial paper program with the comision nacional bancaria y de valores the registration expires in april 2021 and limits the amount of commercial paper up to one year to 500 billion pesos at december 31 2016 888 billion pesos were available for issuance 

  

in the event of a future significant disruption in the financial markets the company may not be able to issue replacement commercial paper as a result the company is exposed to liquidity risk from the shorter maturity of shortterm borrowings paid to lenders compared to the longer timing of receivable collections from customers the company believes its cash balances and investments collections on existing finance receivables syndicated bank lines and current investmentgrade credit ratings of aa1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability a decrease in these credit ratings could negatively impact the company’s ability to access capital markets at competitive interest rates and the company’s ability to maintain liquidity and financial stability paccar believes its financial services companies will be able to continue funding receivables servicing debt and paying dividends through internally generated funds access to public and private debt markets and lines of credit 

commitments 

the following summarizes the company’s contractual cash commitments at december 31 2016

reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures 

this form 10k includes “adjusted net income nongaap” and “adjusted net income per diluted share nongaap” which are financial measures that are not in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” since they exclude the nonrecurring ec charge in 2016 these measures differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled nongaap financial measures used by other companies in addition the form 10k includes the financial ratios noted below calculated based on nongaap measures 

management utilizes these nongaap measures to evaluate the company’s performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding a significant nonrecurring charge that is not representative of underlying operating trends 

reconciliations from the most directly comparable gaap measures to adjusted nongaap measures are as follows 

 

  

  

   

impact of environmental matters 

the company its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment the company believes its policies practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred 

the company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters in certain of these matters the company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies the company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 were 22 million 20 million and 12 million respectively management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the company’s consolidated cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

critical accounting policies 

the company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a of the consolidated financial statements in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented the following are accounting policies which in the opinion of management are particularly sensitive and which if actual results are different from estimates used by management may have a material impact on the financial statements 

operating leases 

trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in note e of the consolidated financial statements in determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles the company considers the length of the lease term the truck model the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand operating lease terms generally range from three to five years the resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30 and 60 of original equipment cost if the sales price of the trucks at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the company’s estimated residual value a gain or loss will result 

future market conditions changes in government regulations and other factors outside the company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant a decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term 

during 2016 market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity decreased resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of 96 million during 2015 and 2014 market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally higher than the residual values on the equipment resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense of 58 million and 106 million respectively 

at december 31 2016 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the financial services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the truck segment was 231 billion a 10 decrease in used truck values worldwide if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the company’s operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the company recording an average of approximately 577 million of additional depreciation per year 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses related to the company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in note d of the consolidated financial statements the company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments retail and wholesale the retail segment consists of retail loans and direct and salestype finance leases net of unearned interest the wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral the wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables and the company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets in determining the allowance for credit losses retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest generally over 36 to 60 months and they are secured by the same type of collateral the allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves 

  

the company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss a finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in addition all retail loans and leases which have been classified as tdrs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired generally impaired accounts are on nonaccrual status impaired accounts classified as tdrs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the company will collect all principal and interest payments 

impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses the determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral when the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the company’s recorded investment no reserve is recorded small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below 

the company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information using past due account data and current market conditions information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts repossession rates the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse the company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions a projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the company’s borrowers and their ability to repay after determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of incurred credit losses net of recoveries inherent in the portfolio 

the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions as accounts become past due the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases the company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 20 and 70 over the past three years the company’s yearend 30 days past due accounts were 5 of loan and lease receivables historically a 100 basis point increase in the 30 days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 5 to 30 basis points of receivables at december 31 2016 30 days past dues were 5 if past dues were 100 basis points higher or 15 as of december 31 2016 the company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of 5 to 20 million depending on the extent of the past dues the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors 

product warranty 

product warranty is disclosed in note h of the consolidated financial statements the expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims net of recoveries management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through qualityimprovement programs however actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve historically those adjustments have not been material over the past three years warranty expense as a percentage of truck parts and other net sales and revenues has ranged between 13 and 18 if the 2016 warranty expense had been 2 higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2016 warranty expense would have increased by approximately 32 million 

pension benefits 

employee benefits are disclosed in note l of the consolidated financial statements the company’s accounting for employee pension benefit costs and obligations is based on management assumptions about the future used by actuaries to estimate net costs and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates longterm rates of return on plan assets inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors management bases these assumptions on historical results the current environment and reasonable estimates of future events 

the discount rate for pension benefits is based on market interest rates of high quality corporate bonds with a maturity profile that matches the timing of the projected benefit payments of the plans changes in the discount rate affect the valuation of the plan benefits obligation and funded status of the plans the longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected returns for each asset class and relative weighting of those asset classes in the plans 

  

because differences between actual results and the assumptions for returns on plan assets retirement rates and mortality rates are accumulated and amortized into expense over future periods management does not believe these differences or a typical percentage change in these assumptions worldwide would have a material effect on its financial results in the next year the most significant assumption which could negatively affect pension expense is a decrease in the discount rate if the discount rate were to decrease 5 2016 net pension expense would increase to 929 million from 701 million and the projected benefit obligation would increase 2080 million to 27 billion from 25 billion 

effective january 2017 the company will change the method used to estimate service cost and interest cost components of pension expense from a single weightedaverage method which is a single discount rate determined at the pension plans’ measurement date to an individual spot rate approach which applies specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows this approach is a more precise measurement of net periodic benefit costs and does not impact the benefit obligation the company considers this a change in estimate inseparable from a change in accounting principle which will be accounted for prospectively this change is expected to lower pension expense by approximately 150 million in 2017 

income taxes 

income taxes are disclosed in note m of the consolidated financial statements the company calculates income tax expense on pretax income based on current tax law deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences on temporary differences between recorded amounts in the financial statements and their respective tax basis the determination of income tax expense requires management estimates and involves judgment regarding indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings jurisdictional mix of earnings and future outcomes regarding tax law issues included in tax returns the company updates its assumptions on all of these factors each quarter as well as new information on tax laws and differences between estimated taxes and actual returns when filed if the company’s assessment of these matters changes the effect is accounted for in earnings in the period the change is made

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend currencies are presented in millions for the market risks and derivative instruments sections below 

interestrate risks  see note o for a description of the company’s hedging programs and exposure to interest rate fluctuations the company measures its interestrate risk by estimating the amount by which the fair value of interestrate sensitive assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments would change assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase across the yield curve as shown in the following table 

 

 currency risks  the company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations of foreign currencies particularly the canadian dollar the euro the british pound the australian dollar the brazilian real and the mexican peso see note o for additional information concerning these hedges  based on the company’s sensitivity analysis the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 unfavorable change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be a loss of 315 related to contracts outstanding at december 31 2016 compared to a loss of 304 at december 31 2015 these amounts would be largely offset by changes in the values of the underlying hedged exposures

 item 1 business tableend  

 paccar inc the company or paccar incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1971 is the successor to pacific car and foundry company which was incorporated in washington in 1924 the company traces its predecessors to seattle car manufacturing company formed in 1905 

 

 information about the company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to items 101b c1i and d of regulation sk appears in item 8 note r of this form 10k 

 

 paccar is a multinational company operating in three principal industry segments 

 

  

  

 paccar’s other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches 

trucks 

paccar’s trucks are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia brasil canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of freight petroleum wood products and constructionrelated and other materials the company also manufactures engines at its facilities in columbus mississippi and eindhoven the netherlands paccar competes in the north american class 8 market primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in chillicothe ohio denton texas renton washington ste therese canada and mexicali mexico paccar also competes in the north american class 6 to 7 markets primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada and in mexicali mexico paccar competes in the european lightmedium market with daf coe trucks assembled in the united kingdom by leyland one of paccar’s wholly owned subsidiaries and participates in the european heavy market with daf coe trucks assembled in the netherlands and the united kingdom paccar competes in the brazilian heavy truck market with daf models assembled at ponta grossa in the state of paraná brasil paccar competes in the australian light and heavy truck markets with kenworth conventional and coe models assembled at its facility at bayswater in the state of victoria australia and daf coe models assembled in the netherlands commercial truck manufacturing comprises the largest segment of paccar’s business and accounts for 77 of total 2015 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands and is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in brasil and australia the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to paccar’s truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

  

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions some manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis reflecting the similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate 

the company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality and are essentially custom products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specification some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures paccar engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models the company also manufactures engines at its columbus mississippi facility in 2015 the company installed paccar engines in 40 of the company’s kenworth and peterbilt heavyduty trucks in the us and canada engines not manufactured by the company are purchased from cummins inc cummins the company purchased a significant portion of its transmissions from eaton corporation plc eaton and zf friedrichshafen ag zf the company has longterm agreements with cummins eaton and zf to provide for continuity of supply a loss of supply from cummins eaton or zf and the resulting interruption in the production of trucks would have a material effect on the company’s results purchased materials and parts include raw materials partially processed materials such as castings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers raw materials partially processed materials and finished components make up approximately 85 of the cost of new trucks the value of major finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 35 in europe to approximately 85 in north america in addition to materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation property taxes and utilities the company’s cost of sales are highly correlated to sales 

the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3 of consolidated revenues in 2015 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would either require the company to contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself 

other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products no significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2015 manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks are dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical based on the level of overall economic activity the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s costs for trucks consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as the periodic need to meet diesel engine emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs

financial services 

paccar financial services pfs operates in 22 countries in north america europe australia and south america through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name pfs also conducts full service leasing operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in north america germany and australia under the paclease trade name selected dealers in north america are franchised to provide full service leasing pfs provides its franchisees with equipment financing and administrative support pfs also operates its own full service lease outlets pfs’s retail loan and lease customers consist of small medium and large commercial trucking companies independent owneroperators and other businesses and acquire their paccar trucks principally from independent paccar dealers pfs accounted for 6 of total net sales and revenues and 58 of total assets in 2015 

the company’s finance receivables are classified as dealer wholesale dealer retail and customer retail segments the dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to independent paccar dealers the dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises which use the proceeds to fund their customers’ acquisition of trucks and related equipment the customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for their acquisition of trucks and related equipment customer retail receivables are further segregated by fleet and owneroperator classes the fleet class consists of customers operating more than five trucks all others are considered owneroperators similar methods are employed to assess and monitor credit risk for each class 

finance receivables are secured by the trucks and related equipment being financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts generally range from three to five years depending on the type and use of equipment payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one to two years 

  

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in public and private offerings and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies pfs attempts to match the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases 

key factors affecting the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to pfs new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by kenworth peterbilt and daf and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment the company’s financial services market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market pfs’s primary competitors include commercial banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of pfs to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term pfs obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings a portion of which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interestrate contracts this enables pfs to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the acquisition cost of leased equipment the term of the leases which generally ranges from three to five years and the residual value of the leases which generally ranges from 30 to 50 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation including interest and depreciation 

pfs incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts pfs takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses 

the ability of customers to pay their obligations to pfs depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel among other factors pfs limits its exposure to any one customer with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 5 of the aggregate portfolio assets pfs generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck collateral and may require other collateral or guarantees in the event of default pfs will repossess the truck and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network pfs will also seek to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices pfs’s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness pfs provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the economic environment in each of its markets 

financial services sga expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the loan and lease portfolios these costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend to be relatively stable

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

business and industry risks 

commercial truck market demand is variable  the company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the company’s equipment and services the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america and europe demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors 

competition and prices the company operates in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect the company’s sales and pricing financial results depend largely on the ability to develop manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand 

production costs and supplier capacity the company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the company’s financial results or use of its production capacity many of the company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity unexpected events including natural disasters may increase the company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the company’s or its suppliers’ operations 

  

liquidity risks credit ratings and costs of funds disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the company’s sources of liquidity or the liquidity of customers dealers and suppliers a lowering of the company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets the company’s financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt if the markets for commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s financial services segment competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the company’s financial services segment 

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

interestrate risks the financial services segment is subject to interestrate risks because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins pfs uses derivative contracts to match the interest rate characteristics of its debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates 

product liability litigation and regulatory actions the company’s products are subject to recall for environmental performance and safetyrelated issues product recalls lawsuits regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the company establishes for contingencies may increase the company’s costs and lower profits refer to item 3 – legal proceedings for a discussion of the risk associated with the european commission investigation the company’s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets and claims or regulatory actions even if unsuccessful or without merit could adversely affect the company’s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity 

information technology the company relies on information technology systems including the internet and other computer systems which may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures computer viruses or outside parties attempting to disrupt the company’s business or gain unauthorized access to the company’s electronic data the company maintains protections to guard against such events if the company’s computer systems were to be damaged disrupted or breached it could result in a negative impact on the company’s operating results and could also cause reputational damage business disruption or the disclosure of confidential data 

political regulatory and economic risks 

multinational operations  the company’s global operations are exposed to political economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems natural calamities wars terrorism and labor strikes changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and international trade policies may impact demand for the company’s products financial results and competitive position paccar’s global operations are subject to extensive trade competition and anticorruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs 

environmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs the company could experience higher research and development costs due to changes in government requirements for its products including changes in emissions fuel greenhouse gas or other regulations 

  

currency exchange and translation the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the company’s assets liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk as reported in the company’s financial statements the company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce but not eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

accounting estimates in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented certain of these estimates judgments and assumptions such as residual values on operating leases the allowance for credit losses warranty and pension expenses and the provision for income taxes are particularly sensitive if actual results are different from estimates used by management they may have a material impact on the financial statements for additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates see “critical accounting policies” under item 7 of this form 10k 

taxes changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the company operates impact the company’s effective tax rate changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the company’s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities

 the company’s worldwide truck net sales and revenues increased to 1478 billion from 1459 billion in 2014 primarily due to higher truck deliveries in the us and europe the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies to the us dollar primarily the euro reduced 2015 worldwide truck net sales and revenues by 9400 million 

truck segment income before income taxes and pretax return on revenues reflect higher truck unit deliveries and improved gross margins in the us and europe the effects on income before income taxes of translating weaker foreign currencies to the us dollar primarily the euro were largely offset by lower costs of north american mx engine components imported from europe 

  

the company’s new truck deliveries are summarized below 

 

 truck selling general and administrative expenses sga for 2015 decreased to 1926 million from 1982 million in 2014 the decrease was primarily due to currency translation effect 218 million mostly related to a decline in the value of the euro relative

the 2014 effective income tax rate of 327 increased from 309 in 2013 the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a higher proportion of income generated in higher taxed jurisdictions 

 

 2015 compared to 2014 

operating activities cash provided by operations increased 4324 million to 256 billion in 2015 compared to 212 billion in 2014 higher operating cash flow reflects 2452 million of higher net income and 2538 million from inventory as there was 643 million in net inventory reductions in 2015 vs 1895 million in net inventory purchases in 2014 in addition higher cash inflows reflects 1766 million from accounts receivables as collections exceeded sales in 2015 1053 million compared to sales exceeding collections in 2014 713 million a lower increase in financial services salestype finance leases and dealer direct loans on new trucks also contributed 1265 million these cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows of 4149 million from accounts payable and accrued expenses where payments from goods and services exceeded purchases in 2015 1626 million compared to purchases exceeding payments in 2014 2523 million 

  

investing activities cash used in investing activities of 197 billion in 2015 increased 4430 million from the 153 billion used in 2014 primarily due to higher cash used in the acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of 1994 million 1697 million higher net purchases of marketable securities and 1160 million in higher net originations of retail loans and direct financing leases in 2015 these outflows were partially offset by higher proceeds from asset disposals of 533 million

2014 compared to 2013 

operating activities cash provided by operations decreased 2521 million to 212 billion in 2014 compared to 238 billion in 2013 lower operating cash flow reflects a higher increase in financial services segment wholesale receivables of 1503 million and a higher increase in net purchases of inventories of 1499 million in addition lower cash inflows resulted from a reduction in liabilities for residual value guarantees rvg and deferred revenues of 1387 million primarily due to a lower volume of new rvg contracts compared to 2013 and 549 million in higher pension contributions these outflows were partially offset by 1875 million of higher net income and 745 million of higher depreciation on property plant and equipment 

investing activities cash used in investing activities of 153 billion in 2014 decreased 6191 million from the 215 billion used in 2013 primarily due to lower net new loan and lease originations of 2570 million lower payments for property plant and equipment of 2124 million and lower cash used in the acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of 1231 million

credit lines and other 

the company has line of credit arrangements of 343 billion of which 326 billion were unused at december 31 2015 included in these arrangements are 30 billion of syndicated bank facilities of which 10 billion expires in june 2016 10 billion expires in june 2019 and 10 billion expires in june 2020 the company intends to replace these credit facilities on or before expiration with facilities of similar amounts and duration these credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing mediumterm notes there were no borrowings under the syndicated bank facilities for the year ended december 31 2015 

on september 21 2015 the company completed the repurchase of 3000 million of the company’s common stock under authorizations approved in december 2011 on september 23 2015 paccar’s board of directors approved the repurchase of an additional 3000 million of the company’s common stock and as of december 31 2015 1363 million of shares have been repurchased pursuant to the 2015 authorization 

at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 the company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of 182 billion and 160 billion respectively which are considered indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries the company 

  

periodically repatriates foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to the us parent were 24 billion 24 billion and 19 billion in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the company believes that its us cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities future operating cash flow and access to the capital markets along with periodic repatriation of foreign earnings will be sufficient to meet us liquidity requirements 

truck parts and other 

the company provides funding for working capital capital expenditures rd dividends stock repurchases and other business initiatives and commitments primarily from cash provided by operations management expects this method of funding to continue in the future 

investments for property plant and equipment in 2015 increased to 3065 million from 2208 million in 2014 primarily due to higher investments by daf in europe and the construction of a new parts distribution center in renton washington over the past decade the company’s combined investments in worldwide capital projects and rd totaled 592 billion which have significantly increased the operating capacity and efficiency of its facilities and the competitive advantage of the company’s premium products 

in 2016 capital investments are expected to be 325 to 375 million and rd is expected to be 240 to 270 million focused on enhanced aftermarket support manufacturing facilities and new product development 

the company conducts business in spain italy portugal ireland greece russia ukraine and certain other countries which have been experiencing significant financial stress fiscal or political strain and the corresponding potential default the company routinely monitors its financial exposure to global financial conditions global counterparties and operating environments as of december 31 2015 the company had finance and trade receivables in these countries of approximately 1 of consolidated total assets in addition the company’s exposures in these countries were insignificant for both derivative counterparty credit and marketable debt security investments in corporate or sovereign government securities as of december 31 2015 

financial services 

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in the public markets and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies 

the company issues commercial paper for a portion of its funding in its financial services segment some of this commercial paper is converted to fixed interest rate debt through the use of interestrate swaps which are used to manage interestrate risk 

in november 2015 the company’s us finance subsidiary paccar financial corp pfc filed a shelf registration under the securities act of 1933 the total amount of mediumterm notes outstanding for pfc as of december 31 2015 was 440 billion the registration expires in november 2018 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period 

as of december 31 2015 the company’s european finance subsidiary paccar financial europe had €2690 million available for issuance under a €150 billion mediumterm note program listed on the professional securities market of the london stock exchange this program replaced an expiring program in the second quarter of 2015 and is renewable annually through the filing of new listing particulars 

in april 2011 paccar financial mexico pfm registered a 1000 billion peso mediumterm note and commercial paper program with the comision nacional bancaria y de valores the registration expires in april 2016 and limits the amount of commercial paper up to one year to 500 billion pesos at december 31 2015 804 billion pesos remained available for issuance pfm intends to file a new program in april 2016 

in the event of a future significant disruption in the financial markets the company may not be able to issue replacement commercial paper as a result the company is exposed to liquidity risk from the shorter maturity of shortterm borrowings paid to lenders compared to the longer timing of receivable collections from customers the company believes its cash balances and investments collections on existing finance receivables syndicated bank lines and current investmentgrade credit ratings of aa1 will continue 

  

to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability a decrease in these credit ratings could negatively impact the company’s ability to access capital markets at competitive interest rates and the company’s ability to maintain liquidity and financial stability paccar believes its financial services companies will be able to continue funding receivables servicing debt and paying dividends through internally generated funds access to public and private debt markets and lines of credit 

commitments 

the following summarizes the company’s contractual cash commitments at december 31 2015 

 

 loan and lease commitments are for funding new retail loan and lease contracts residual value guarantees represent the company’s commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value if the customer decides to return the truck at a specified date in the future  

impact of environmental matters 

the company its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment the company believes its policies practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred 

the company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters in certain of these matters the company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies the company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended 

  

december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were 20 million 12 million and 23 million respectively management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the company’s consolidated cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

c ritical a ccounting p olicies  

the company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a of the consolidated financial statements in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented the following are accounting policies which in the opinion of management are particularly sensitive and which if actual results are different from estimates used by management may have a material impact on the financial statements 

operating leases 

trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in note e of the consolidated financial statements in determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles the company considers the length of the lease term the truck model the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand operating lease terms generally range from three to five years the resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30 and 50 of original equipment cost if the sales price of the trucks at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the company’s estimated residual value a gain or loss will result 

future market conditions changes in government regulations and other factors outside the company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant a decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term 

during 2015 2014 and 2013 market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally higher than the residual values on the equipment resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of 58 million 106 million and 44 million respectively 

at december 31 2015 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the financial services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the truck segment was 210 billion a 10 decrease in used truck values worldwide expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the company’s operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the company recording an average of approximately 526 million of additional depreciation per year 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses related to the company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in note d of the consolidated financial statements the company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments retail and wholesale the retail segment consists of retail loans and direct and salestype finance leases net of unearned interest the wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral the wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables and the company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets in determining the allowance for credit losses retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest generally over 36 to 60 months and they are secured by the same type of collateral the allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves 

the company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss a finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in addition all retail loans and leases which have been classified as tdrs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired generally impaired accounts are on nonaccrual status impaired accounts classified as tdrs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the company will collect all principal and interest payments 

  

impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses the determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral when the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the company’s recorded investment no reserve is recorded small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below 

the company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information using past due account data and current market conditions information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts repossession rates the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse the company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions a projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the company’s borrowers and their ability to repay after determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of incurred credit losses net of recoveries inherent in the portfolio 

the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions as accounts become past due the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases the company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 20 and 70 over the past three years the company’s yearend 30 days past due accounts were 5 of loan and lease receivables historically a 100 basis point increase in the 30 days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 5 to 30 basis points of receivables at december 31 2015 30 days past dues were 5 if past dues were 100 basis points higher or 15 as of december 31 2015 the company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of 5 to 25 million depending on the extent of the past dues the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors 

product warranty 

product warranty is disclosed in note h of the consolidated financial statements the expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims net of recoveries management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through qualityimprovement programs however actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve historically those adjustments have not been material over the past three years warranty expense as a percentage of truck parts and other net sales and revenues has ranged between 14 and 18 if the 2015 warranty expense had been 2 higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2015 warranty expense would have increased by approximately 36 million 

pension benefits 

employee benefits are disclosed in note l of the consolidated financial statements the company’s accounting for employee pension benefit costs and obligations is based on management assumptions about the future used by actuaries to estimate net costs and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates longterm rates of return on plan assets inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors management bases these assumptions on historical results the current environment and reasonable estimates of future events 

the discount rate for pension benefits is based on market interest rates of highquality corporate bonds with a maturity profile that matches the timing of the projected benefit payments of the plans changes in the discount rate affect the valuation of the plan benefits obligation and funded status of the plans the longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected returns for each asset class and relative weighting of those asset classes in the plans 

because differences between actual results and the assumptions for returns on plan assets retirement rates and mortality rates are accumulated and amortized into expense over future periods management does not believe these differences or a typical percentage change in these assumptions worldwide would have a material effect on its financial results in the next year the most significant assumption which could negatively affect pension expense is a decrease in the discount rate if the discount rate were to decrease 5 

  

2015 net pension expense would increase to 1076 million from 850 million and the projected benefit obligation would increase 2072 million to 25 billion from 23 billion 

income taxes 

income taxes are disclosed in note m of the consolidated financial statements the company calculates income tax expense on pretax income based on current tax law deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences on temporary differences between recorded amounts in the financial statements and their respective tax basis the determination of income tax expense requires management estimates and involves judgment regarding indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings jurisdictional mix of earnings and future outcomes regarding tax law issues included in tax returns the company updates its assumptions on all of these factors each quarter as well as new information on tax laws and differences between estimated taxes and actual returns when filed if the company’s assessment of these matters changes the effect is accounted for in earnings in the period the change is made

 information about the company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to items 101b c1i and d of regulation sk appears in item 8 note r of this form 10k 

 

 paccar is a multinational company operating in three principal industry segments 1 the truck segment includes the design manufacture and distribution of highquality light medium and heavyduty commercial trucks 2 the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles and 3 the financial services segment includes finance and leasing products and services provided to customers and dealers light and mediumduty trucks have a gross vehicle weight gvw ranging from 16000 to 33000 lbs class 5 to 7 in north america and 6 to 16 metric tonnes in europe heavy duty trucks have a gvw of over 33000 lbs class 8 in north america and over 16 metric tonnes in europe paccar’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to paccar products and associated equipment paccar’s other business is the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches 

trucks 

paccar’s trucks are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia canada mexico and brasil are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of freight petroleum wood products construction and other materials the company also manufactures engines at its columbus mississippi facility paccar competes in the north american class 5  7 markets primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada and in mexicali mexico which are operated by paccar’s wholly owned subsidiaries located in those countries paccar competes in the european lightmedium market with daf caboverengine trucks assembled in the united kingdom by leyland one of paccar’s wholly owned subsidiaries commercial truck manufacturing comprises the largest segment of paccar’s business and accounts for 77 of total 2014 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands and is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in brasil and australia the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to paccar’s truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions some manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors as a result of the close similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis 

the company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality and are essentially custom products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specification some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more 

  

vertically integrated manufactures paccar engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models the company also manufactures engines at its columbus mississippi facility in 2014 the company installed paccar engines in 36 of the company’s kenworth and peterbilt heavyduty trucks in the us and canada engines not manufactured by the company are purchased from cummins inc cummins the company has a longterm agreement with cummins to provide for continuity of supply a loss of supply from cummins and the resulting interruption in the production of trucks would have a material effect on the company’s results the cost of purchased materials and parts includes raw materials partially processed materials such as castings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers the cost of materials purchased from suppliers of raw materials partially processed materials and finished components make up approximately 85 of the cost of new trucks the value of major finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 30 in europe to approximately 85 in north america in addition to purchased materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation property taxes and utilities the company’s cost of sales are highly correlated to sales 

the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european light and mediumduty product lines pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 2 of consolidated revenues in 2014 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would require the company to either contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself 

other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products no significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2014 manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks are dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical related to the level of overall economic activity the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s costs for trucks sold consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by commodities prices such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements with its suppliers to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as the periodic need to meet diesel engine emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

there are four principal competitors in the us and canada commercial truck market the company’s share of the us and canadian class 8 market was 279 of retail sales in 2014 and the company’s mediumduty market share was 167 in 2014 in europe there are six principal competitors in the commercial truck market including parent companies to two competitors of the company in the us in 2014 daf had a 138 share of the western and central european heavyduty market and a 88 share of the lightmedium market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales 

the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

the company’s truck products are subject to environmental noise and emission regulations competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with noise and emission regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

the company had a total production backlog of 56 billion at the end of 2014 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90day backlog approximated 31 billion at december 31 2014 20 billion at december 31 2013 and 14 billion at december 31 2012 production of the year end 2014 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2015 

  

parts 

the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles in the us canada europe australia mexico and south america aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s 17 strategically located parts distribution centers pdcs parts are primarily purchased from various suppliers and also manufactured by the company aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery the parts segment accounted for 16 of total 2014 net sales and revenues 

paccar parts opened a new pdc in montreal canada in 2014 and began construction of a new 160000 squarefoot pdc in renton washington the new facility will increase the distribution capacity for the company’s dealers and customers in the northwestern us and western canada 

key factors affecting parts segment earnings include the aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks to reflect the benefit the parts segment receives from costs incurred by the truck segment certain factory overhead research and development engineering and sga expenses are allocated from the truck segment to the parts segment the company’s costs for parts sold consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by commodities prices such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes longterm supply agreements with its suppliers to reduce the variability of the cost of parts sold the company maintains rigorous control of sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

other businesses 

other businesses include a division of the company which manufactures industrial winches in two us plants and markets them under the braden carco and gearmatic nameplates the markets for these products are highly competitive and the company competes with a number of well established firms sales of industrial winches were approximately 1 of net sales and revenues in 2014 

the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products 

financial services 

paccar financial services pfs operates in 22 countries in north america europe australia and south america through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name pfs also conducts full service leasing operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in north america and germany under the paclease trade name selected dealers in north america are franchised to provide full service leasing pfs provides its franchisees equipment financing and administrative support pfs also operates full service lease outlets on its own behalf pfs’s retail loan and lease customers consist of small medium and large commercial trucking companies independent owneroperators and other businesses that purchased their trucks principally from paccar’s independent dealers pfs accounts for 6 of net sales and revenues in 2014 

the company’s finance receivables are classified as dealer wholesale dealer retail and customer retail segments the dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to paccar dealers the dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises that use the proceeds to fund customers’ acquisition of commercial vehicles and related equipment the customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for the acquisition of commercial vehicles and related equipment customer retail receivables are further segregated between fleet and owneroperator classes the fleet class consists of customer retail accounts operating more than five trucks all other customer retail accounts are considered owneroperator each individual class has similar measurement attributes risk characteristics and common methods to monitor and assess credit risk 

receivables are secured by the products financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts vary with the type and usage of equipment but generally range from three to five years payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one to two years 

  

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in the public markets and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies pfs attempts to match the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases 

key factors affecting the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to pfs new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by kenworth peterbilt and daf and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment finance market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market pfs’s competitors primarily include banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of pfs to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term pfs obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings a portion of which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interest rate contracts this enables pfs to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the amount of leased equipment and the average term of the lease which generally range from three to five years and residual values which generally range from 30 to 50 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation including interest and depreciation 

pfs incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts pfs takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses 

the ability of these customers to pay their obligations to pfs depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel among other factors pfs limits its exposure to any one customer with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 5 of the aggregate portfolio assets pfs generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck equipment collateral and may include other collateral or personal guarantees in the event of default pfs will repossess the vehicle and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network pfs will take legal means to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices pfs’s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness pfs provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the economic environment in each of its markets 

financial services sga expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the company’s loan and lease portfolios these costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend to be relatively stable

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

business and industry risks 

commercial truck market demand is variable  the company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the company’s equipment and services the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america and europe demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors 

competition and prices the company operates in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect the company’s sales and pricing financial results depend largely on the ability to develop manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand 

production costs and supplier capacity the company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the company’s financial results or use of its production capacity many of the company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity unexpected events including natural disasters may increase the company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the company’s or its suppliers’ operations 

liquidity risks credit ratings and costs of funds disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the company’s sources of liquidity or the liquidity of customers dealers and suppliers a lowering of the company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets the company’s financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt if the markets for commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers 

  

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s financial services segment competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the company’s financial services segment 

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

interest rate risks the financial services segment is subject to interest rate risks because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins pfs uses derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates 

product liability litigation and regulatory actions the company’s products are subject to recall for environmental performance and safetyrelated issues product recalls lawsuits regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the company establishes for contingencies may increase the company’s costs and lower profits refer to item 3 – legal proceedings for a discussion of the risk associated with the european commission investigation the company’s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets and claims or regulatory actions even if unsuccessful or without merit could adversely affect the company’s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity 

information technology the company relies on information technology systems including the internet and other computer systems which may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures computer viruses or outside parties attempting to disrupt the company’s business or gain unauthorized access to the company’s electronic data the company maintains protections to guard against such events if the company’s computer systems were to be damaged disrupted or breached it could result in negative impact on the company’s operating results and also could cause reputational damage business disruption or the disclosure of confidential data 

political regulatory and economic risks 

multinational operations the company’s global operations are exposed to political economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems natural calamities wars terrorism and labor strikes changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and international trade policies may impact demand for the company’s products financial results and competitive position paccar’s global operations are subject to extensive trade competition and anticorruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs 

environmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to and affected by environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs the company could experience higher research and development costs due to changes in government requirements for its products including changes in engine and vehicle emissions safety regulations fuel requirements or greenhouse gas regulations 

  

currency exchange and translation the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the company’s assets liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk as reported in the company’s financial statements the company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce but not eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

accounting estimates in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented certain of these estimates judgments and assumptions such as residual values on operating leases the allowance for credit losses warranty and pension expenses and the provision for income taxes are particularly sensitive if actual results are different from estimates used by management they may have a material impact on the financial statements for additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates see “critical accounting policies” under item 7 of this form 10k 

taxes changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the company operates impact the company’s effective tax rate changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the company’s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities

consolidated net sales and revenues of 1899 billion in 2014 were the highest in the company’s history the increase of 11 from 1712 billion in 2013 was mainly due to record truck and aftermarket parts sales and higher financial services revenues truck unit sales increased in 2014 to 142900 units from 137100 units in 2013 reflecting higher industry retail sales in the us and canada partially offset by a lower over 16tonne market in europe record freight volumes and improving fleet utilization are contributing to excellent parts and service business 

in 2014 paccar earned net income for the 76th consecutive year net income in 2014 of 136 billion was the second highest in the company’s history increasing from 117 billion in 2013 primarily due to record truck and parts segment sales improved truck segment operating margin and record financial services segment pretax income earnings per diluted share of 382 was the second best in the company’s history

truck and parts outlook 

truck industry retail sales in the us and canada in 2015 are expected to be 250000–280000 units compared to 249400 units in 2014 driven by expansion of truck industry fleet capacity and economic growth in europe the 2015 truck industry registrations for over 16tonne vehicles are expected to be 200000–240000 units compared to the 226900 truck registrations in 2014 

heavyduty truck industry sales for south america were 129000 units in 2014 and heavyduty truck industry sales are estimated to be in a range of 110000 to 130000 units in 2015 the production of daf trucks in brasil and the continued growth of the daf brasil dealer network will further enhance paccar’s vehicle sales in south america 

  

in 2015 paccar parts sales are expected to grow 58 in north america reflecting steady economic growth and high fleet utilization paccar parts deliveries are expected to increase in europe reflecting slightly improving freight markets and paccar parts’ innovative customer service programs sales in europe may be affected by recent declines in the values of the euro relative to the us dollar 

capital investments in 2015 are expected to be 300 to 350 million focused on enhanced powertrain development and increased operating efficiency for our factories and distribution centers research and development rd in 2015 is expected to be 220 to 260 million focused on new products and services 

financial services outlook 

based on the truck market outlook average earning assets in 2015 are expected to be slightly higher than current levels current levels of freight tonnage freight rates and fleet utilization are contributing to customers’ profitability and cash flow if current freight transportation conditions decline due to weaker economic conditions then past due accounts truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current low levels 

see the forwardlooking statements section of management’s discussion and analysis for factors that may affect these outlooks 

results of operations 

 

 the following provides an analysis of the results of operations for the company’s three reportable segments  truck parts and financial services where possible the company has quantified the impact of factors identified in the following discussion and analysis in cases where it is not possible to quantify the impact of factors the company lists them in estimated order of importance factors for which the company is unable to specifically quantify the impact include market demand fuel prices freight tonnage and economic conditions affecting the company’s results of operations 

  

2014 compared to 2013 

truck 

the company’s truck segment accounted for 77 and 76 of total revenues for 2014 and 2013 respectively 

 

 in 2014 industry retail sales in the heavyduty market in the us and canada increased to 249400 units from 212200 units in 2013 the company’s heavyduty truck retail market share was 279 compared to 280 in 2013 the mediumduty market was 73300 units in 2014 compared to 65900 units in 2013 the company’s mediumduty market share was a record 167 in 2014 compared to 157 in 2013 

the over 16tonne truck market in western and central europe in 2014 was 226900 units a 6 decrease from 240800 units in 2013 the largest decreases were in the uk and france partially offset by increases in germany and spain the company’s market share was 138 in 2014 a decrease from 162 in 2013 the decrease in market share was primarily due to the lower daf registrations in the uk and the netherlands which were impacted by the euro 5euro 6 transition rules the 6 to 16tonne market in 2014 was 46900 units compared to 57200 units in 2013 the company’s market share was 88 in 2014 a decrease from 118 in 2013 the decline in market share is a result of reduced registrations in the uk which were also affected by the euro 5euro 6 transition rules

the company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters in certain of these matters the company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies the company has provided an accrual for the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 12 million 23 million and 17 million respectively management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the company’s consolidated cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

critical accounting policies 

the company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a of the consolidated financial statements in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented the following are accounting policies which in the opinion of management are particularly sensitive and which if actual results are different from estimates used by management may have a material impact on the financial statements 

operating leases 

trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in note e of the consolidated financial statements in determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles the company considers the length of the lease term the truck model the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand operating lease terms generally range from three to five years the resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30 and 50 of original equipment cost if the sales price of the trucks at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the company’s estimated residual value a gain or loss will result 

  

future market conditions changes in government regulations and other factors outside the company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant a decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term 

during 2014 2013 and 2012 market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally higher than the residual values on the equipment resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of 106 million 44 million and 50 million respectively 

at december 31 2014 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the financial services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the truck segment was 191 billion a 10 decrease in used truck values worldwide expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the company’s operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the company recording an average of approximately 478 million of additional depreciation per year 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses related to the company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in note d of the consolidated financial statements the company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments retail and wholesale the retail segment consists of retail loans and direct and salestype finance leases net of unearned interest the wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral the wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables and the company requires monthly reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases obtains personal guarantees or other security such as dealership assets in determining the allowance for credit losses retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest generally over 36 to 60 months and they are secured by the same type of collateral the allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves 

the company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss a finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in addition all retail loans and leases which have been classified as tdrs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired generally impaired accounts are on nonaccrual status impaired accounts classified as tdrs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the company will collect all principal and interest payments 

impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses the determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral when the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the company’s recorded investment no reserve is recorded small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below 

for finance receivables that are not individually impaired the company collectively evaluates and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information using past due account data and current market conditions information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts repossession rates the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse the company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions a projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the company’s borrowers and their ability to repay after determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of incurred credit losses net of recoveries inherent in the portfolio 

  

the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions as accounts become past due the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases the company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 20 and 80 over the past three years the company’s yearend 30 days past due accounts have ranged between 5 and 6 of loan and lease receivables historically a 100 basis point increase in the 30 days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 5 to 30 basis points of receivables past dues were 5 at december 31 2014 if past dues were 100 basis points higher or 15 as of december 31 2014 the company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of 5 to 25 million depending on the extent of the past dues the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors 

product warranty 

product warranty is disclosed in note h of the consolidated financial statements the expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims net of recoveries management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through qualityimprovement programs however actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve historically those adjustments have not been material over the past three years warranty expense as a percentage of truck parts and other net sales and revenues has ranged between 12 and 16 if the 2014 warranty expense had been 2 higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2014 warranty expense would have increased by approximately 36 million 

pension benefits 

employee benefits are disclosed in note l of the consolidated financial statements the company’s accounting for employee pension benefit costs and obligations is based on management assumptions about the future used by actuaries to estimate net costs and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates longterm rates of return on plan assets inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors management bases these assumptions on historical results the current environment and reasonable estimates of future events 

the discount rate for pension benefits is based on market interest rates of highquality corporate bonds with a maturity profile that matches the timing of the projected benefit payments of the plans changes in the discount rate affect the valuation of the plan benefits obligation and funded status of the plans the longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected returns for each asset class and relative weighting of those asset classes in the plans 

because differences between actual results and the assumptions for returns on plan assets retirement rates and mortality rates are accumulated and amortized into expense over future periods management does not believe these differences or a typical percentage change in these assumptions worldwide would have a material effect on its financial results in the next year the most significant assumption which could negatively affect pension expense is a decrease in the discount rate if the discount rate was to decrease 5 2014 net pension expense would increase to 762 million from 531 million and the projected benefit obligation would increase 2196 million to 26 billion from 24 billion 

income taxes 

income taxes are disclosed in note m of the consolidated financial statements the company calculates income tax expense on pretax income based on current tax law deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences on temporary differences between recorded amounts in the financial statements and their respective tax basis the determination of income tax expense requires management estimates and involves judgment regarding indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings jurisdictional mix of earnings and future outcomes regarding tax law issues included in tax returns the company updates its assumptions on all of these factors each quarter as well as new information on tax laws and differences between estimated taxes and actual returns when filed if the company’s assessment of these matters changes the effect is accounted for in earnings in the period the change is made

 item 1 business tableend  

 paccar inc the company or paccar incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1971 is the successor to pacific car and foundry company which was incorporated in washington in 1924 the company traces its predecessors to seattle car manufacturing company formed in 1905 

 

 information about the company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to items 101b c1i and d of regulation sk appears in item 8 note r of this form 10k 

 

 paccar is a multinational company operating in three principal industry segments 1 the truck segment includes the design manufacture and distribution of highquality light medium and heavyduty commercial trucks 2 the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles and 3 the financial services segment includes finance and leasing products and services provided to customers and dealers light and mediumduty trucks have a gross vehicle weight gvw ranging from 16000 to 33000 lbs class 5 to 7 in north america and 6 to 16 metric tonnes in europe heavy duty trucks have a gvw of over 33000 lbs class 8 in north america and over 16 metric tonnes in europe paccar’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to paccar products and associated equipment paccar’s other business is the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches 

trucks 

paccar’s trucks are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia canada mexico and brasil are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of freight petroleum wood products construction and other materials paccar competes in the north american class 5  7 markets primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada and in mexicali mexico which are operated by paccar’s wholly owned subsidiaries located in those countries paccar competes in the european lightmedium market with daf caboverengine trucks assembled in the united kingdom by leyland one of paccar’s wholly owned subsidiaries paccar completed construction of its new 300000 squarefoot daf assembly facility in ponta grossa brasil in october 2013 brasil is a major truck market with industry sales above six tonnes in 2013 of 149000 units during the fourth quarter of 2013 daf began truck production in brasil commercial truck manufacturing comprises the largest segment of paccar’s business and accounts for 76 of total 2013 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands and is also marketed and distributed by a foreign subsidiary in brasil the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to paccar’s truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions some manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors as a result of the close similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis 

the company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality and are essentially custom products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specification some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions 

  

and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures paccar engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models in 2013 the company installed paccar engines in 33 of the company’s kenworth and peterbilt heavyduty trucks in the us and canada engines not manufactured by the company are purchased from cummins inc cummins the company has a long term agreement with cummins to provide for continuity of supply a loss of supply from cummins and the resulting interruption in the production of trucks would have a material effect on the company’s results the cost of purchased materials and parts includes raw materials partially processed materials such as castings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers the cost of materials purchased from suppliers of raw materials partially processed materials and finished components make up approximately 85 of the cost of new trucks the value of major finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 35 in europe to approximately 85 in north america in addition to purchased materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation property taxes and utilities the company’s cost of sales are highly variable in relation to sales 

the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3 of consolidated revenues in 2013 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would either require the company to contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself 

other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products no significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2013 manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks is dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical related to the level of overall economic activity the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s costs for trucks sold consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by commodities prices such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes long term supply agreements with its suppliers to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as the periodic need to meet diesel engine emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

there are four principal competitors in the us and canada commercial truck market the company’s share of the us and canadian class 8 market was 280 of retail sales in 2013 in europe there are six principal competitors in the commercial truck market including parent companies to two competitors of the company in the united states in 2013 daf had a record 162 share of the western and central european heavyduty market and a record 118 share of the lightmedium market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales 

the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

the company’s truck products are subject to environmental noise and emission regulations competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with noise and emission regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

the company had a total production backlog of 40 billion at the end of 2013 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90day backlog approximated 20 billion at december 31 2013 14 billion at december 31 2012 and 26 billion at december 31 2011 production of the year end 2013 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2014 

  

parts 

the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles in the us canada europe australia mexico and south america aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s 16 strategically located parts distribution centers pdcs parts are primarily purchased from various suppliers and also manufactured by the company aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery the parts segment accounted for 16 of total 2013 net sales and revenues 

during 2013 paccar completed construction of a new 280000 squarefoot parts pdc in eindhoven the netherlands established a pdc in ponta grossa brasil and doubled the warehouse space in its lancaster pennsylvania pdc 

key factors affecting parts segment earnings include the aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks to reflect the benefit the parts segment receives from costs incurred by the truck segment certain factory overhead research and development engineering and sga expenses are allocated from the truck segment to the parts segment the company’s cost for parts sold consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by commodities prices such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes long term supply agreements with its suppliers to reduce the variability of the cost of parts sold the company maintains rigorous control of sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

other businesses 

other businesses include a division of the company which manufactures industrial winches in two us plants and markets them under the braden carco and gearmatic nameplates the markets for these products are highly competitive and the company competes with a number of well established firms sales of industrial winches were approximately 1 of net sales and revenues in 2013 2012 and 2011 

the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products 

financial services 

paccar financial services pfs operates in 23 countries in north america europe australia and south america through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name pfs also conducts full service leasing operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in north america and germany under the paclease trade name selected dealers in north america are franchised to provide full service leasing pfs provides its franchisees equipment financing and administrative support pfs also operates full service lease outlets on its own behalf pfs’s retail loan and lease customers consist of small medium and large commercial trucking companies independent owneroperators and other businesses that purchased their trucks principally from paccar’s independent dealers 

the company’s finance receivables are classified as dealer wholesale dealer retail and customer retail segments the dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to paccar dealers the dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises that use the proceeds to fund customers’ acquisition of commercial vehicles and related equipment the customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for the acquisition of commercial vehicles and related equipment customer retail receivables are further segregated between fleet and owneroperator classes the fleet class consists of customer retail accounts operating more than five trucks all other customer retail accounts are considered owneroperator each individual class has similar measurement attributes risk characteristics and common methods to monitor and assess credit risk 

receivables are secured by the products financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts vary with the type and usage of equipment but generally range from three to five years payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one to two years 

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in the public markets and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies pfs attempts to match the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases 

  

key factors affecting the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to pfs new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by kenworth peterbilt and daf and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment finance market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market pfs’s competitors primarily include banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of pfs to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term pfs obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings a portion of which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interest rate contracts this enables pfs to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the amount of leased equipment and the average term of the lease which generally range from three to five years and residual values which generally range from 30 to 50 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation including interest and depreciation 

pfs incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts pfs takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses and the related provision for losses 

the ability of these customers to pay their obligations to pfs depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel among other factors pfs limits its exposure to any one customer with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 4 of the aggregate portfolio pfs generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck equipment collateral and may include other collateral or personal guarantees in the event of default pfs will repossess the vehicle and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network pfs will take legal means to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices pfs’s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness pfs provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the economic environment in each of its markets 

financial services sga expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the company’s loan and lease portfolios these costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend to be relatively stable 

patents 

the company owns numerous patents which relate to all product lines although these patents are considered important to the overall conduct of the company’s business no patent or group of patents is considered essential to a material part of the company’s business

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

business and industry risks 

commercial truck market demand is variable  the company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the company’s equipment and services the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america and europe demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors 

competition and prices the company operates in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect the company’s sales and pricing financial results depend largely on the ability to develop manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand 

production costs and supplier capacity the company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the company’s financial results or use of its production capacity many of the company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity unexpected events including natural disasters may increase the company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the company’s or its suppliers’ operations 

liquidity risks credit ratings and costs of funds disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the company’s sources of liquidity or the liquidity of customers dealers and suppliers a lowering of the company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets the company’s financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt if the markets for commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s financial services segment competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the company’s financial services segment 

  

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

interest rate risks the financial services segment is subject to interest rate risks because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins pfs uses derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates 

product liability litigation and recalls costs associated with product recalls lawsuits or increases in the reserves the company establishes for contingencies may increase the company’s costs the company’s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets and product or other claims even if unsuccessful or without merit could adversely affect the company’s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity the company’s products are subject to recall for environmental performance and safetyrelated issues which can cause increased costs and lower profits 

information technology the company relies on information technology systems including the internet and other computer systems which may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures computer viruses or outside parties attempting to disrupt the company’s business or gain unauthorized access to the company’s electronic data the company maintains excellent protections to guard against such events if the company’s computer systems were to be damaged disrupted or breached it could result in negative impact on the company’s operating results and also could cause reputational damage business disruption or the disclosure of confidential data 

political regulatory and economic risks 

multinational operations  the company’s global operations are exposed to political economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems natural calamities wars terrorism and labor strikes changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and international trade policies may impact demand for the company’s products financial results and competitive position paccar’s global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

environmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to and affected by environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs the company could experience higher research and development costs due to changes in government requirements for its products including changes in engine and vehicle emissions safety regulations fuel requirements or greenhouse gas regulations 

currency exchange and translation the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the company’s assets liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk as reported in the company’s financial statements the company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce but not eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

accounting estimates in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented certain of these estimates judgments and assumptions such as residual values on operating leases the allowance for credit losses warranty and pension expenses and the provision for income taxes are particularly sensitive if actual results are different from estimates used by management they may have a material impact on the financial statements for additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates see “critical accounting policies” under item 7 of this form 10k 

  

taxes changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the company operates impact the company’s effective tax rate changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the company’s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities

financial services 

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in the public markets and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies 

the company issues commercial paper for a portion of its funding in its financial services segment some of this commercial paper is converted to fixed interest rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps which are used to manage interest rate risk in the event of a future significant disruption in the financial markets the company may not be able to issue replacement commercial paper as a result the company is exposed to liquidity risk from the shorter maturity of shortterm borrowings paid to lenders compared to the longer timing of receivable collections from customers the company believes its cash balances and investments collections on existing finance receivables syndicated bank lines and current investmentgrade credit ratings of aa1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability a decrease in these credit ratings could negatively impact the company’s ability to access capital markets at competitive interest rates and the company’s ability to maintain liquidity and financial stability 

in november 2012 the company’s us finance subsidiary paccar financial corp pfc filed a shelf registration under the securities act of 1933 effective for a three year period the total amount of mediumterm notes outstanding for pfc as of december 31 2013 was 385 billion the registration expires in the fourth quarter of 2015 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period 

as of december 31 2013 the company’s european finance subsidiary paccar financial europe had €4185 million available for issuance under a €150 billion mediumterm note program registered with the london stock exchange the program was renewed in the second quarter of 2013 and is renewable annually through the filing of a new prospectus 

in april 2011 paccar financial mexico registered a 1000 billion peso mediumterm note and commercial paper program with the comision nacional bancaria y de valores the registration expires in 2016 and limits the amount of commercial paper up to one year to 500 billion pesos at december 31 2013 738 billion pesos remained available for issuance 

paccar believes its financial services companies will be able to continue funding receivables servicing debt and paying dividends through internally generated funds access to public and private debt markets and lines of credit 

commitments 

the following summarizes the company’s contractual cash commitments at december 31 2013 

 

  

  of the 855 billion total cash commitments for borrowings and interest on term debt 840 billion were related to the financial services segment as described in note i of the consolidated financial statements borrowings consist primarily of term notes and commercial paper issued by the financial services segment the company expects to fund its maturing financial services debt 

  

obligations principally from funds provided by collections from customers on loans and lease contracts as well as from the proceeds of commercial paper and mediumterm note borrowings purchase obligations are the company’s contractual commitment to acquire future production inventory and capital equipment other obligations include deferred cash compensation 

the company’s other commitments include the following at december 31 2013 

 

 loan and lease commitments are for funding new retail loan and lease contracts residual value guarantees represent the company’s commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value if the customer decides to return the truck at a specified date in the future  

impact of environmental matters  

the company its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment the company believes its policies practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations enacted at the time such use and disposal occurred 

the company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters in certain of these matters the company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies the company has provided an accrual for the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were 23 million 17 million and 12 million respectively management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the company’s consolidated cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

critical accounting policies  

the company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a of the consolidated financial statements in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented the following are accounting policies which in the opinion of management are particularly sensitive and which if actual results are different from estimates used by management may have a material impact on the financial statements 

operating leases 

trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in note e of the consolidated financial statements in determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles the company considers the length of the lease term the truck model the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand operating lease terms generally range from three to five years the resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30 and 50 of original equipment cost if the sales price of the trucks at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the company’s estimated residual value a gain or loss will result 

future market conditions changes in government regulations and other factors outside the company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant a decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term 

during 2013 2012 and 2011 market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally higher than the residual values on the equipment resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of 44 million 50 million and 102 million respectively 

  

at december 31 2013 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the financial services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the truck segment was 189 billion a 10 decrease in used truck values worldwide expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the company’s operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the company recording an average of approximately 472 million of additional depreciation per year 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses related to the company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in note d of the consolidated financial statements the company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments retail and wholesale the retail segment consists of retail loans and direct and salestype finance leases net of unearned interest the wholesale segment consists of wholesale financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral the wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables and the company requires monthly reporting of the dealer’s financial condition conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases obtains personal guarantees or other security such as dealership assets in determining the allowance for credit losses retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest generally over 36 to 60 months and they are secured by the same type of collateral the allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves 

the company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment finance receivables which are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss a finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in addition all retail loans and leases which have been classified as tdrs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired generally all impaired accounts are on nonaccrual status 

impaired receivables are considered collateral dependent large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses the determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral when the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the company’s recorded investment no reserve is recorded small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below 

for finance receivables that are not individually impaired the company collectively evaluates and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information using past due account data and current market conditions information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts repossession rates the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse the company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions a projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the company’s borrowers and their ability to repay after determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses the provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of incurred credit losses net of recoveries inherent in the portfolio 

the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions as accounts become past due the likelihood increases they will not be fully collected the company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 20 and 80 over the past three years the company’s yearend 30 days past due accounts have ranged between 5 and 15 of loan and lease receivables historically a 100 basis point increase in the 30 days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 10 to 35 basis points of receivables past dues were 5 at december 31 2013 if past dues were 100 basis points higher or 15 as of december 31 2013 the company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by approximately 5 to 22 million depending on the extent of the past dues the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors 

  

product warranty 

product warranty is disclosed in note h of the consolidated financial statements the expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims net of recoveries management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through qualityimprovement programs however actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve historically those adjustments have not been material over the past three years warranty expense as a percentage of truck parts and other net sales and revenues has ranged between 11 and 12 if the 2013 warranty expense had been 2 higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2013 warranty expense would have increased by approximately 32 million 

pension benefits 

employee benefits are disclosed in note l of the consolidated financial statements the company’s accounting for employee pension benefit costs and obligations is based on management assumptions about the future used by actuaries to estimate net costs and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates longterm rates of return on plan assets inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors management bases these assumptions on historical results the current environment and reasonable estimates of future events 

the discount rate for pension benefits is based on market interest rates of highquality corporate bonds with a maturity profile that matches the timing of the projected benefit payments of the plans changes in the discount rate affect the valuation of the plan benefits obligation and funded status of the plans the longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected returns for each asset class and relative weighting of those asset classes in the plans 

because differences between actual results and the assumptions for returns on plan assets retirement rates and mortality rates are accumulated and amortized into expense over future periods management does not believe these differences or a typical percentage change in these assumptions worldwide would have a material effect on its financial results in the next year the most significant assumption which could negatively affect pension expense is a decrease in the discount rate if the discount rate was to decrease 5 2013 net pension expense would increase to 963 million from 801 million and the projected benefit obligation would increase 153 million to 211 billion from 196 billion 

income taxes 

income taxes are disclosed in note m of the consolidated financial statements the company calculates income tax expense on pretax income based on current tax law deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences on temporary differences between recorded amounts in the financial statements and their respective tax basis the determination of income tax expense requires management estimates and involves judgment regarding indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings jurisdictional mix of earnings and future outcomes regarding tax law issues included in tax returns the company updates its assumptions on all of these factors each quarter as well as new information on tax laws and differences between estimated taxes and actual returns when filed if the company’s assessment of these matters changes the effect is accounted for in earnings in the period the change is made

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend currencies are presented in millions for the market risks and derivative instruments sections below

 currency risks  the company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations of foreign currencies particularly the canadian dollar the euro the british pound the australian dollar the brazilian real and the mexican peso  see note o for additional information concerning these hedges  based on the company’s sensitivity analysis the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 unfavorable change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be a loss of 277 related to contracts outstanding at december 31 2013 compared to a loss of 280 at december 31 2012 these amounts would be largely offset by changes in the values of the underlying hedged exposures

 item 1 business tableend  

 paccar inc the company or paccar incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1971 is the successor to pacific car and foundry company which was incorporated in washington in 1924 the company traces its predecessors to seattle car manufacturing company formed in 1905 

 

 information about the company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to items 101b c1i and d of regulation sk appears on page 82 of the annual report to stockholders for the year ended december 31 2012 and is incorporated herein by reference 

 

 the company has three principal industry segments 1 design manufacture and distribution of light medium and heavyduty trucks 2 distribution of parts for the truck aftermarket and related commercial vehicles and 3 finance and leasing products and services provided to customers and dealers light and mediumduty trucks have a gross vehicle weight gvw ranging from 16000 to 33000 lbs class 5 to 7 in north america and 6 to 16 metric tonnes in europe heavy duty trucks have a gvw of over 33000 lbs class 8 in north america and over 16 metric tonnes in europe the company’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to company products and associated equipment the company’s other business is the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches 

trucks 

the company and its subsidiaries design and manufacture heavy medium and light duty diesel trucks which are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of freight petroleum wood products construction and other materials the company competes in the north american class 5  7 markets primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada and in mexicali mexico which are operated by the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries located in those countries the company competes in the european lightmedium market with daf caboverengine trucks assembled in the united kingdom by leyland one of the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries the company is constructing a new daf assembly plant in ponta grossa brasil and expects to begin manufacturing daf vehicles for sale in brasil and other south american countries in late 2013 commercial trucks comprise the largest segment of the company’s business accounting for 77 of total 2012 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions some manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors as a result of the close similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis 

  

the company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality and are essentially custom products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specification some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models in 2010 the company began installing paccar engines in approximately 25 of the company’s kenworth and peterbilt heavyduty trucks in the us and canada engines not manufactured by the company are purchased from cummins inc cummins the company has a long term agreement with cummins to provide for continuity of supply a loss of supply from cummins and the resulting interruption in the production of trucks would have a material effect on the company’s results the cost of purchased materials and parts includes raw materials partially processed materials such as castings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers the cost of materials purchased from suppliers of raw materials partially processed materials and finished components make up more than 85 of the cost of new trucks the value of finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 50 in europe to approximately 90 in north america in addition to purchased materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation property taxes and utilities the company’s cost of sales are highly variable in relation to sales 

the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3 of consolidated revenues in 2012 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would either require the company to contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself 

other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products no significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2012 manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks is dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical related to the level of overall economic activity the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s costs for trucks sold consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by commodities prices such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes long term supply agreements with its suppliers to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as the periodic need to meet diesel engine emissions standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

there are four principal competitors in the us and canada commercial truck market the company’s share of the us and canadian class 8 market was 289 of retail sales in 2012 in 

  

europe there are six principal competitors in the commercial truck market including parent companies to two competitors of the company in the united states in 2012 daf had a 160 share of the western and central european heavyduty market and a 115 share of the lightmedium market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service and paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales 

the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

the company’s truck products are subject to environmental noise and emission regulations and competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with noise and emission regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

the company had a total production backlog of 34 billion at the end of 2012 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90day backlog approximated 14 billion at december 31 2012 26 billion at december 31 2011 and 20 billion at december 31 2010 production of the year end 2012 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2013 

parts 

the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles in the us canada europe australia mexico and south america aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s fifteen parts distribution centers pdc parts are primarily purchased from various suppliers and also manufactured by the company aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery as a percentage of total consolidated net sales and revenues parts sales were 16 in 2012 

key factors affecting parts segment earnings include the aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks to reflect the benefit the parts segment receives from the truck segment certain factory overhead research and development engineering and selling general and administrative expenses are allocated from the truck segment to the parts segment the company’s cost for parts sold consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by commodities prices such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes long term supply agreements with its suppliers to reduce the variability of the cost of parts sold the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

other businesses 

other businesses include a division of the company which manufactures industrial winches in two us plants and markets them under the braden carco and gearmatic nameplates the markets for these products are highly competitive and the company competes with a number of well established firms sales of industrial winches were approximately 1 of net sales and revenues in 2012 2011 and 2010 

the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products 

financial services 

paccar financial services pfs operates in 23 countries principally in north america europe australia and south america through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name pfs also conducts full service leasing operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in north america and germany under the paclease trade name selected 

  

dealers in north america are franchised to provide full service leasing pfs provides its franchisees equipment financing and administrative support pfs also operates full service lease outlets on its own behalf pfs’s retail loan and lease customers consist of small medium and large commercial trucking companies independent owneroperators and other businesses that purchased their trucks principally from paccar’s independent dealers 

the company’s finance receivables are classified as wholesale dealer retail and customer retail segments customer retail receivables are further segregated between fleet customer retail accounts operating more than five trucks and owneroperator all other customer retail accounts classes each individual class has similar measurement attributes risk characteristics and common methods to monitor and assess credit risk the wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to paccar dealers the customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for the acquisition of commercial vehicles and related equipment the dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises that use the proceeds to fund customers’ acquisition of commercial vehicles and related equipment 

receivables are secured by the products financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts vary with the type and usage of equipment but generally range from three to five years payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one to two years 

the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and mediumterm notes issued in the public markets and to a lesser extent bank loans an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies 

pfs funds its financing activities primarily through commercial paper bank loans and by issuing mediumterm debt through public debt markets pfs attempts to match the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases 

key factors affecting the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to pfs new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by kenworth peterbilt and daf and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment finance market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market pfs’s competitors primarily include banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of pfs to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term pfs obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interest rate contracts this enables pfs to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the amount of leased equipment and the average term of the lease which generally range from three to five years and residual values which generally range from 30 to 50 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation including interest and depreciation 

pfs incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts pfs takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses and the related provision for losses 

  

the ability of these customers to pay their obligations to pfs depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel pfs limits its exposure to any one customer with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 4 of the aggregate portfolio pfs generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck equipment collateral and may include other collateral or personal guarantees in the event of default pfs will repossess the vehicle and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network pfs will take legal means to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices pfs’s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness pfs provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the economic environment in each of its markets 

financial services selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the company’s loan and lease portfolios these costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend to be relatively stable 

patents 

the company owns numerous patents which relate to all product lines although these patents are considered important to the overall conduct of the company’s business no patent or group of patents is considered essential to a material part of the company’s business

commercial truck market demand is variable  the company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the company’s equipment and services the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america and europe demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors 

competition and prices the company operates in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect the company’s sales and pricing financial results depend largely on the ability to develop manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand 

production costs and supplier capacity the company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the company’s financial results or use of its production capacity many of the company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity unexpected events including natural disasters may increase the company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the company’s or its suppliers’ operations 

liquidity risks credit ratings and costs of funds disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the company’s sources of liquidity or the liquidity of customers dealers and suppliers a lowering of the company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets the company’s financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt if the markets for commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s financial services segment competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the company’s financial services segment 

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

  

interest rate risks the financial services segment is subject to interest rate risks because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins pfs uses derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates 

product liability litigation and recalls costs associated with product recalls lawsuits or increases in the reserves the company establishes for contingencies may increase the company’s costs the company’s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets and product or other claims even if unsuccessful or without merit could adversely affect the company’s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity the company’s products are subject to recall for environmental performance and safetyrelated issues which can cause increased costs and lower profits 

political regulatory and economic risks 

multinational operations  the company’s global operations are exposed to political economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems natural calamities wars terrorism and labor strikes changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and international trade policies may impact demand for the company’s products financial results and competitive position paccar’s global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

environmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to and affected by environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs the company could experience higher research and development costs due to changes in environmental requirements for its products including changes in engine and vehicle emissions fuel requirements or greenhouse gas regulations 

currency exchange and translation the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the company’s assets liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk as reported in the company’s financial statements the company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce but not eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

accounting estimates in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented certain of these estimates judgments and assumptions such as residual values on operating leases the allowance for credit losses warranty and pension expenses and the provision for income taxes are particularly sensitive if actual results are different from estimates used by management they may have a material impact on the financial statements 

taxes changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the company operates impact the company’s effective tax rate changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the company’s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities

 item 1 business tableend  

 paccar inc the company or paccar incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1971 is the successor to pacific car and foundry company which was incorporated in washington in 1924 the company traces its predecessors to seattle car manufacturing company formed in 1905 

 

 information about the company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to items 101b c1i and d of regulation sk appears on page 78 of the annual report to stockholders for the year ended december 31 2011 and is incorporated herein by reference 

 

 the company has two principal industry segments 1 design manufacture and distribution of light medium and heavyduty trucks and related aftermarket parts and 2 finance and leasing products and services provided to customers and dealers light and mediumduty trucks have a gross vehicle weight gvw ranging from 16000 to 33000 lbs class 5 to 7 in north america and 6 to 15 metric tonnes in europe heavy duty trucks have a gvw of over 33000 lbs class 8 in north america and over 15 metric tonnes in europe the company’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to company products and associated equipment other manufactured products include industrial winches 

trucks 

the company and its subsidiaries design and manufacture heavyduty diesel trucks which are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of freight petroleum wood products construction and other materials the company competes in the north american class 5  7 markets primarily with kenworth and peterbilt conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada and in mexicali mexico which are operated by the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries located in those countries the company competes in the european lightmedium market with daf caboverengine trucks assembled in the united kingdom by leyland one of the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries the company has acquired land and has begun construction of a new daf assembly plant in ponta grossa brasil the company expects to begin manufacturing daf vehicles for sale in brasil and other south american markets in 2013 commercial trucks and related aftermarket parts comprise the largest segment of the company’s business accounting for 937 of total 2011 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks and related aftermarket parts are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions certain manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors as a result of the close similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis 

  

the company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality and are essentially custom products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specification some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models in 2010 the company began installing paccar engines in approximately 25 of the company’s kenworth and peterbilt heavyduty trucks in the us and canada engines not manufactured by the company are purchased from cummins inc cummins the company has a long term agreement with cummins to provide for continuity of supply a loss of supply from cummins and the resulting interruption in the production of trucks would have a material effect on the company’s results of operations the cost of purchased materials and parts includes raw materials partially processed materials such as castings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers the cost of materials purchased from suppliers of raw materials partially processed materials and finished components make up more than 80 of the cost of new trucks and parts the value of finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 45 in europe to approximately 90 in north america in addition to purchased materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle and parts delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation property taxes and utilities the company’s cost of sales are highly variable in relation to sales 

the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3 of consolidated revenues in 2011 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would either require the company to contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself 

other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products no significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2011 manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s parts distribution network parts are both manufactured by the company and purchased from various suppliers aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery as a percentage of total consolidated net sales and revenues parts sales were 158 in 2011 213 in 2010 and 234 in 2009 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks and aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks is dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical related to the level of overall economic activity the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s cost for trucks and parts sold consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by commodities prices such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes long term supply agreements with its suppliers to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as the periodic need to meet diesel engine emissions standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

  

there were four other principal competitors in the us and canada commercial truck market in 2011 the company’s share of the us and canadian class 8 market was 281 of retail sales in 2011 in europe there were six other principal competitors in the commercial truck market in 2011 including parent companies to two competitors of the company in the united states in 2011 daf had a 155 share of the western and central european heavyduty market and a 89 share of the lightmedium market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service and paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales 

the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

the company’s truck products are subject to environmental noise and emission regulations and competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with noise and emission regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

the company had a total production backlog of 49 billion at the end of 2011 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90day backlog approximated 26 billion at december 31 2011 20 billion at december 31 2010 and 11 billion at december 31 2009 production of the year end 2011 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2012 

other business 

the truck and other businesses include a division of the company which manufactures industrial winches in two us plants and markets them under the braden carco and gearmatic nameplates the markets for these products are highly competitive and the company competes with a number of well established firms sales of industrial winches were approximately 1 of net sales and revenues in 2011 2010 and 2009 

the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products 

financial services 

paccar financial services pfs operates in 21 countries principally in north america europe and australia through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name pfs provides inventory financing for independent dealers selling paccar products and retail loan and lease financing for new and used trucks and other transportation equipment sold principally by its independent dealers receivables are secured by the products financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts vary with the type and usage of equipment but generally range from three to five years payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one to two years 

pfs also conducts full service leasing operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in north america and germany under the paclease trade name selected dealers in north america are franchised to provide full service leasing pfs provides its franchisees equipment financing and administrative support pfs also operates full service lease outlets on its own behalf 

pfs funds its financing activities primarily through commercial paper bank loans and by issuing mediumterm debt through public debt markets pfs attempts to match the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases 

  

key factors affecting the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to pfs new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by kenworth peterbilt and daf and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment finance market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market pfs’s competitors primarily include banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of pfs to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term pfs obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interest rate contracts this enables pfs to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the amount of leased equipment and the average term of the lease which ranges from two to four years and residual values which generally range from 30 to 50 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation including interest and depreciation 

pfs incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts pfs takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses and the related provision for losses retail loan and lease customers consist of small medium and large commercial trucking companies independent owner operators and other businesses that use trucks in their operations the ability of these customers to pay their obligations to pfs depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel 

pfs limits its exposure to any one customer with no one customer amounting to more than 2 of the aggregate portfolio pfs generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck equipment collateral and may include other collateral or personal guarantees in the event of default pfs will repossess the vehicle and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network pfs will take legal means to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices pfs’s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness pfs provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the economic climate in each of its markets 

financial services selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the company’s loan and lease portfolios these costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend to be relatively stable 

patents 

the company owns numerous patents which relate to all product lines although these patents are considered important to the overall conduct of the company’s business no patent or group of patents is considered essential to a material part of the company’s business

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

business and industry risks 

commercial truck market demand is variable  the company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the company’s equipment and services the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america and europe demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors 

competition and prices the company operates in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect the company’s sales and pricing financial results depend largely on the ability to develop manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand 

production costs and supplier capacity the company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the company’s financial results or use of its production capacity many of the company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity unexpected events including natural disasters may increase the company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the company’s or its suppliers’ operations 

  

liquidity risks credit ratings and costs of funds disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the company’s sources of liquidity or the liquidity of customers dealers and suppliers a lowering of the company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets the company’s financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt if the markets for commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s financial services segment competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the company’s financial services segment 

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

interest rate risks the financial services segment is subject to interest rate risks because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins pfs uses derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates 

product liability litigation and recalls costs associated with product recalls lawsuits or increases in the reserves the company establishes for contingencies may increase the company’s costs the company’s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets and product or other claims even if unsuccessful or without merit could adversely affect the company’s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity the company’s products are subject to recall for environmental performance and safetyrelated issues which can cause increased costs and lower profits 

political regulatory and economic risks 

multinational operations  the company’s global operations are exposed to political economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems natural calamities wars terrorism and labor strikes changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and international trade policies may impact demand for the company’s products financial results and competitive position paccar’s global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

environmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to and affected by environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs the company could experience higher research and development costs due to changes in environmental requirements for its products including changes in engine and vehicle emissions fuel requirements or greenhouse gas regulations 

  

currency exchange and translation the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the company’s assets liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk as reported in the company’s financial statements the company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce but not eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

accounting estimates in the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented certain of these estimates judgments and assumptions such as residual values on operating leases the allowance for credit losses warranty and pension expenses and the provision for income taxes are particularly sensitive if actual results are different from estimates used by management they may have a material impact on the financial statements 

taxes changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the company operates in impact the company’s effective tax rate changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the company’s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities

c narrative description of business 

the company has two principal industry segments 1 design manufacture and distribution of light medium and heavyduty trucks and related aftermarket parts and 2 finance and leasing products and services provided to customers and dealers light and mediumduty trucks have a gross vehicle weight gvw ranging from 16000 to 33000 lbs class 5 to 7 in north america and 6 to 15 metric tonnes in europe heavy duty trucks have a gvw of over 33000 lbs class 8 market in north america and over 15 metric tonnes in europe the company’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to company products and associated equipment other manufactured products include industrial winches 

trucks 

the company and its subsidiaries design and manufacture heavyduty diesel trucks which are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of freight petroleum wood products construction and other materials the company competes in the north american class 5  7 markets primarily with conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada and in mexicali mexico which are operated by the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries located in those countries the company competes in the european lightmedium market with daf caboverengine trucks assembled in the united kingdom by leyland one of the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries commercial trucks and related aftermarket parts comprise the largest segment of the company’s business accounting for 897 of total 2010 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks and related aftermarket parts are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands a us division paccar international also markets all three nameplates outside each of their primary markets the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

  

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions certain manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate in common production facilities while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors as a result of the close similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis 

the company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality and are essentially custom products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specification some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models the material costs of trucks and parts includes raw materials partially processed materials such as castings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers the cost of materials purchased from suppliers of raw materials partially processed materials and finished components make up more than 85 of the cost of new trucks and parts the value of finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 45 in europe to approximately 90 in north america in addition to purchased materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle and parts delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation property taxes and utilities the company’s cost of sales are highly variable in relation to sales 

raw materials and other components used in the manufacture of trucks are purchased from a number of suppliers the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3 of consolidated revenues in 2010 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would either require the company to contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products no significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2010 manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s parts distribution network parts are both manufactured by the company and purchased from various suppliers aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery as a percentage of total consolidated net sales and revenues parts sales were 213 in 2010 234 in 2009 and 151 in 2008 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks and aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks is dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical related to the level of overall economic activity the 

  

availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s cost per truck and parts sold consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by commodities prices such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes long term supply agreements with its suppliers to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as the periodic need to meet diesel engine emissions standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

there were three other principal competitors in the us and canada class 8 truck market in 2010 the company’s share of the us and canadian market was 241 of retail sales in 2010 in europe there were five other principal competitors in the commercial vehicle market in 2010 including parent companies to two competitors of the company in the united states in 2010 daf had a 152 share of the western and central european heavyduty market and a 77 share of the lightmedium market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service and paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales 

the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

the company’s truck products are subject to environmental noise and emission regulations and competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with noise and emission regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

the company had a total production backlog of 35 billion at the end of 2010 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90day backlog approximated 20 billion at december 31 2010 11 billion at december 31 2009 and 08 billion at december 31 2008 production of the yearend 2010 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2011 

other business 

the truck and other businesses include a division of the company which manufactures industrial winches in two us plants and markets them under the braden carco and gearmatic nameplates the markets for these products are highly competitive and the company competes with a number of well established firms sales of industrial winches were approximately 1 of net sales and revenues in 2010 2009 and 2008 

the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products 

financial services 

in north america australia and 16 european countries the company provides financing and leasing arrangements principally for its manufactured trucks through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name they provide inventory financing for independent dealers selling paccar products and retail loan and lease financing for new and used trucks and other transportation equipment sold principally by its independent dealers receivables are secured by the products financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts vary with the type and usage of equipment but generally range from three to five 

  

years payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one to two years 

the company also conducts full service leasing operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in north america and germany under the paclease trade name selected dealers in north america are franchised to provide full service leasing the company provides its franchisees equipment financing and administrative support the company also operates full service lease outlets on its own behalf 

the company funds its financing activities primarily through commercial paper bank loans and by issuing mediumterm debt through public debt markets the company attempts to match the maturity and interest rate characteristics of the debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases 

key factors in determining the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to the company new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by the company and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment finance market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market the company’s competitors primarily include banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of the company to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term the company obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interest rate contracts this enables the company to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the amount of leased equipment and the average term of the lease which ranges from two to four years and residual values which generally range from 30 to 50 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation including interest and depreciation 

the company incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts the company takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses and the related provision for losses retail loan and lease customers consist of medium and large commercial trucking companies independent owner operators and other businesses that use trucks in their operations the ability of these customers to pay their obligations to the company depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel the company limits its exposure to any one customer with no one customer amounting to more than 2 of the aggregate portfolio the company generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck equipment collateral and may include other collateral or personal guarantees in the event of default the company will repossess the vehicle and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network the company will take legal means to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck 

  

prices the company’s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession used truck prices tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during those periods the company provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the economic climate in each of its markets 

financial services selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the company’s loan and lease portfolios these cost vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend be relatively stable 

patents 

the company owns numerous patents which relate to all product lines although these patents are considered important to the overall conduct of the company’s business no patent or group of patents is considered essential to a material part of the company’s business 

regulation 

as a manufacturer of highway trucks the company is subject to the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act and federal motor vehicle safety standards promulgated by the national highway traffic safety administration as well as environmental laws and regulations in the united states and is subject to similar regulations in canada mexico australia and europe in addition the company is subject to certain other licensing requirements to do business in the united states and europe the company believes it is in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to safety standards the environment and other licensing requirements in all countries where it has operations

business and industry risks 

commercial truck market demand is variable demand for commercial vehicles depends on economic and other conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america 

  

and western europe demand may also be affected by factors impacting new truck prices such as costs of raw materials and components and cost of compliance with governmental regulations including tariffs engine emissions regulations import regulations and taxes 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s commercial truck unit sales an increase in residual value risk due to lower used truck pricing and increased funding costs are also factors which may negatively affect the company’s financial services operations 

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

the financial services segment is subject to liquidity risk  the global economy is recovering from a recession and financial markets liquidity has improved the company’s financial services segment has been able to issue commercial paper and mediumterm notes and obtain bank debt if commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this may have a negative effect on the company’s financial services segment results 

political regulatory and economic risks

trucks 

the company and its subsidiaries design and manufacture heavyduty diesel trucks which are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in three plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of freight petroleum wood products construction and other materials the company competes in the north american class 5  7 markets primarily with conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada and in mexicali mexico which are operated by the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries located in those countries the company competes in the european lightmedium market with daf caboverengine trucks assembled in the united kingdom by leyland one of the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries commercial trucks and related aftermarket parts comprise the largest segment of the company’s business accounting for 865 of total 2009 net sales and revenues 

substantially all trucks and related aftermarket parts are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands a us division paccar international also markets all three nameplates outside each of their primary markets the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

  

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions certain manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate in common production facilities while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors as a result of the close similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis 

the company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality and are essentially custom products most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specification some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models the material costs of trucks and parts includes raw materials partially processed materials such as castings and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers the cost of materials purchased from suppliers of raw materials partially processed materials and finished components make up more than 85 of the cost of new trucks and parts the value of finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 50 in europe to approximately 90 in north america in addition to purchased materials the company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead vehicle and parts delivery and warranty accordingly except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation property taxes and utilities the company’s cost of sales are highly variable in relation to sales 

raw materials and other components used in the manufacture of trucks are purchased from a number of suppliers the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3 of consolidated revenues in 2009 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would either require the company to contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products no significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2009 manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s parts distribution network parts are both manufactured by the company and purchased from various suppliers aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery as a percentage of total consolidated net sales and revenues parts sales were 234 in 2009 151 in 2008 and 150 in 2007 

key factors affecting truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks and aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales the company’s sales of new trucks is dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the company’s share of those markets aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical related to the level of overall economic activity the 

  

availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported the company’s cost per truck and parts sold consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by commodities prices such as steel copper aluminum and petroleum the company utilizes long term supply agreements with its suppliers to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components the company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as the periodic need to meet diesel engine emissions standards in the various markets served the company maintains rigorous control of selling general and administrative sga expenses and seeks to minimize such costs 

there were three other principal competitors in the us and canada class 8 truck market in 2009 the company’s share of the us and canadian market was 251 of retail sales in 2009 in europe there were five other principal competitors in the commercial vehicle market in 2009 including parent companies to two competitors of the company in the united states in 2009 daf had a 148 share of the western and central european heavyduty market and a 93 share of the lightmedium market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service and paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales 

the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

the company’s truck products are subject to environmental noise and emission regulations and competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with noise and emission regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

the company had a total production backlog of 14 billion at the end of 2009 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90day backlog approximated 11 billion at december 31 2009 08 billion at december 31 2008 and 22 billion at december 31 2007 production of the yearend 2009 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2010 

other business 

the truck and other businesses include a division of the company which manufactures industrial winches in two us plants and markets them under the braden carco and gearmatic nameplates the markets for these products are highly competitive and the company competes with a number of well established firms sales of industrial winches were approximately 1 of net sales and revenues in 2009 2008 and 2007 

the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products 

financial services 

in north america australia and 16 european countries the company provides financing and leasing arrangements principally for its manufactured trucks through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name they provide inventory financing for independent dealers selling paccar products and retail loan and lease financing for new and used trucks and other transportation equipment sold principally by its independent dealers receivables are secured by the products financed or leased the terms of loan and lease contracts vary with the type and usage of equipment but generally range from three to seven 

  

years payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan whichever comes first dealer inventory loans generally mature within one to two years 

the company also conducts full service leasing operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in north america and germany under the paclease trade name selected dealers in north america are franchised to provide full service leasing the company provides its franchisees equipment financing and administrative support the company also operates full service lease outlets on its own behalf 

the company funds its financing activities primarily through commercial paper bank loans and by issuing mediumterm debt through public debt markets the company attempts to match the maturity of the debt with the maturity of loans and leases 

key factors in determining the earnings of the financial services segment include the volume of new loans and leases the yield earned on the loans and leases the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to the company new loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by the company and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the financial services segment finance market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market the company’s competitors primarily include banks and independent finance and leasing companies 

the revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of the company to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term the company obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interest rate contracts this enables the company to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term included in financial services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases the amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the amount of leased equipment and the average term of the lease which ranges from three to seven years and residual values which generally range from 30 to 50 the margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of funding including interest and deprecation 

the company incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and lease contracts the company takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses and the related provision for losses retail loan and lease customers consist of medium and large commercial trucking companies independent owner operators and other businesses that use trucks in their operations the ability of these customers to pay their obligations to the company depends on the state of the general economy the extent of freight demand freight rates and the cost of fuel the company limits the exposure of any one customer with no one customer amounting to more than 3 of the aggregate portfolio the company generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck equipment collateral and may include other collateral or personal guarantees in the event of default the company will repossess the vehicle and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network the company will take legal means to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral the amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and leases and in the event of repossession the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices the company’s 

  

experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that higher past dues lead to increased rates of repossession used truck prices tend to fall during periods of economic weakness as a result credit losses tend to increase during those periods the company provides an allowance for credit losses based on an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio considering the amount of past due accounts the trends of used truck prices and the economic climate in each of its markets 

financial services selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the company’s loan and lease portfolios these cost vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities tend be relatively stable 

patents 

the company owns numerous patents which relate to all product lines although these patents are considered important to the overall conduct of the company’s business no patent or group of patents is considered essential to a material part of the company’s business

and western europe demand may also be affected by factors impacting new truck prices such as costs of raw materials and components and cost of compliance with governmental regulations including tariffs engine emissions regulations import regulations and taxes 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s commercial truck unit sales an increase in residual value risk due to lower used truck pricing and increased funding costs are also factors which may negatively affect the company’s financial services operations 

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

the financial services segment is subject to liquidity risk  the global economy is experiencing a recession and the financial markets are experiencing significant volatility financial turmoil is affecting the banking system and financial markets and has resulted in reduced liquidity in the global credit markets despite the reduced liquidity the company’s financial services segment has generally been able to issue commercial paper and mediumterm notes and obtain bank debt if commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this may have a negative effect on the company’s financial services segment results 

political regulatory and economic risks

risk factors 

tableend

business and industry risks 

 

commercial truck market demand is variable   demand for commercial vehicles depends on economic and other conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves which are principally north america and western europe demand may also be affected by factors impacting new truck prices such as costs of raw materials and components and cost of compliance with governmental regulations including tariffs engine emissions regulations import regulations and taxes 

 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company competes with banks other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates which may lead to decreased margins lower market share or both a decline in the company’s commercial truck unit sales an increase in residual value risk due to lower used truck pricing and increased funding costs are also factors which may negatively affect the company’s financial services operations 

 

the financial services segment is subject to credit risk   the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans leases and derivative contracts with the company although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company resulting in credit losses 

 

t he financial services segment is subject to liquidity risk  the global economy is experiencing a recession and the financial markets are experiencing significant volatility financial turmoil is affecting the banking system and financial markets and has resulted in reduced liquidity in the global credit markets despite the reduced liquidity the company’s financial services segment has generally been able to issue commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt if commercial paper mediumterm notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future the financial services segment may limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets this may have a negative effect on the company’s financial services segment results

  

  

political regulatory and economic risks 

 

the company’s operations could be subject to currency and interest rate fluctuations the company’s consolidated financial statements which are presented in us dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations through both translation and transaction risk the company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce but not eliminate the effects of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations

  information about the company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to items 101b c1i and d of regulation sk appears on page 49 of the annual report to stockholders for the year ended december 31 2007 and is incorporated herein by reference 

  

  c narrative description of business 

  

  the company has two principal industry segments 1 design manufacture and distribution of light medium and heavyduty trucks and related aftermarket distribution of parts and 2 finance and leasing services provided to customers and dealers the company’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to company products and associated equipment other manufactured products include industrial winches 

  

trucks     the company and its subsidiaries design and manufacture heavyduty diesel trucks which are marketed under the kenworth peterbilt and daf nameplates these trucks which are built in four plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of freight petroleum wood products construction and other materials the company competes in the north american class 57 markets primarily with conventional models these trucks are assembled at facilities in ste therese canada and in mexicali mexico which are operated by the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries located in those countries the company competes in the european lightmedium 6 to 15 metric ton market with daf caboverengine trucks assembled in the united kingdom by leyland one of the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries commercial trucks and related replacement parts comprise the largest segment of the company’s business accounting for 91 of total 2007 net sales and revenues 

  

  substantially all trucks and related parts are sold to independent dealers the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf nameplate is marketed and distributed by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the netherlands a us division paccar international also markets all three nameplates outside each of their primary markets the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

  

  

  the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology technical research and testing treasury and finance functions certain manufacturing plants in north america produce trucks for more than one nameplate in common production facilities while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors as a result of the close similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis 

  

  the company’s trucks are essentially custom products and have a reputation for high quality for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models the value of truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 45 in europe to approximately 90 in north america 

  

  raw materials and other components used in the manufacture of trucks are purchased from a number of suppliers the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 4 of consolidated revenues in 2007 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would either require the company to contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products no significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2007 manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

  

  replacement truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s parts distribution network parts are both manufactured by the company and purchased from various suppliers replacement parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery as a percentage of total consolidated net sales and revenues parts sales were 150 in 2007 118 in 2006 and 120 in 2005 

  

  there were three other principal competitors in the us and canada class 8 truck market in 2007 the company’s share of the us and canadian market was 264 of retail sales in 2007 in europe there were five other principal competitors in the commercial vehicle market in 2007 including parent companies to two competitors of the company in the united states in 2007 daf had a 139 share of the western and central european heavyduty market and a 83 share of the lightmedium market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service and paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations in sales 

  

  the peterbilt kenworth and daf nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

  

  

  the company’s truck products are subject to environmental noise and emission regulations and competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations the company believes the cost of complying with noise and emission regulations will not be detrimental to its business 

  

  the company had a total production backlog of 47 billion at the end of 2007 within this backlog orders scheduled for delivery within three months 90 days are considered to be firm the 90day backlog approximated 22 billion at december 31 2007 27 billion at december 31 2006 and 25 billion at december 31 2005 production of the yearend 2007 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2008 

  

other business     the truck and other businesses include a division of the company which manufactures industrial winches in two us plants and markets them under the braden carco and gearmatic nameplates the markets for these products are highly competitive and the company competes with a number of well established firms sales of industrial winches were approximately 1 of net sales and revenues in 2007 2006 and 2005 

  

  the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products 

  

financial services     in north america australia and 14 european countries the company provides financing and leasing arrangements principally for its manufactured trucks through wholly owned finance companies operating under the paccar financial trade name they provide inventory financing for independent dealers selling paccar products and retail and lease financing for new and used trucks and other transportation equipment sold principally by its independent dealers receivables are secured by the products financed or leased 

  

  the company also conducts full service leasing operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in north america and germany under the paclease trade name selected dealers in north america are franchised to provide full service leasing the company provides its franchisees equipment financing and administrative support the company also operates full service lease outlets on its own behalf

c narrative description of business 

  

the company has two principal industry segments 1 design manufacture and distribution of light medium and heavyduty trucks and related aftermarket distribution of parts and 2 finance and leasing services provided to customers and dealers the company’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to company products and associated equipment other manufactured products include industrial winches 

  

trucks   the company and its subsidiaries design and manufacture heavyduty diesel trucks which are marketed under the peterbilt kenworth daf and foden nameplates these vehicles which are built in four plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of freight petroleum wood products construction and other materials commercial trucks and related replacement parts comprise the largest segment of the company’s business accounting for 95 of total 2004 net sales and revenues 

  

the company through its peterbilt and kenworth divisions competes in the north american medium duty class 67 markets primarily with conventional models these mediumduty trucks are assembled at the company’s ste therese quebec plant and at the company’s facility in mexicali mexico the company competes in the european lightmedium 6 to 15 metric ton commercial vehicle market with daf caboverengine trucks assembled in the united kingdom by leyland one of the company’s whollyowned subsidiaries 

  

substantially all trucks and related parts are sold to dealers which are independent except for a small number of factory branches the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf and foden nameplates are marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries headquartered in the netherlands and united kingdom respectively a us division paccar international also markets all four nameplates outside each of their primary markets the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

  

  

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology engineering technical research and testing treasury and finance functions certain manufacturing plants in north america and europe produce trucks for more than one nameplate in common production facilities while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors also as a result of the close similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis 

  

the company’s trucks are essentially custom products and have a reputation for high quality for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models the value of truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 40 in europe to approximately 85 in north america 

  

raw materials and other components used in the manufacture of trucks are purchased from a number of suppliers the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3 of consolidated revenues in 2004 a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would either require the company to contract for an alternative source of supply or for the company to manufacture cabs itself other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products no significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2004 manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

  

replacement truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s parts distribution network parts are both manufactured by the company and purchased from various suppliers replacement parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery as a percentage of total consolidated net sales and revenues parts sales were 12 in 2004 and 15 in 2003 and 2002

c narrative description of business 

  

the company has two principal industry segments 1 manufacture and distribution of light medium and heavyduty trucks and related aftermarket distribution of parts and 2 finance and leasing services provided to customers and dealers the company distributes trucks and parts primarily through its independent dealer network the company’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to company products and associated equipment other manufactured products include industrial winches 

  

trucks   

the company and its subsidiaries design and manufacture heavyduty diesel trucks which are marketed under the peterbilt kenworth daf and foden nameplates these vehicles which are built in four plants in the united states three in europe and one each in australia canada and mexico are used worldwide for overtheroad and offhighway hauling of freight petroleum wood products construction and other materials commercial trucks and related replacement parts comprise the largest segment of the company’s business accounting for 93 of total 2002 net sales and revenues 

  

the company through its peterbilt and kenworth divisions competes in the north american mediumduty class 67 markets primarily with conventional models these mediumduty trucks are assembled at the company’s ste therese quebec plant and at the company’s facility in mexicali mexico this line of business represents a small but increasing percentage of the company’s north american sales the company competes in the european lightmedium 6 to 15 metric ton commercial vehicle market with daf caboverengine trucks assembled in the united kingdom by leyland one of the company’s whollyowned subsidiaries 

  

substantially all trucks and related parts are sold to dealers which are independent except for a small number of factory branches the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the us and a foreign subsidiary in canada the kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in mexico and australia the daf and foden nameplates are marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries headquartered in the netherlands and united kingdom respectively a us division paccar international also markets all four nameplates outside each of their primary markets the decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to truck segment operations and reflects legal tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where paccar operates 

  

 

the truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing information technology engineering technical research and testing treasury and finance functions certain manufacturing plants in north america and europe produce trucks for more than one nameplate in common production facilities while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate depending on various factors also as a result of the close similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate best manufacturing practices within the company are shared on a routine basis 

  

the company’s trucks are essentially custom products and have a reputation for high quality for a significant portion of the company’s truck operations major components such as engines transmissions and axles as well as a substantial percentage of other components are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to paccar and customer specifications daf which is more vertically integrated manufactures its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models the value of truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 50 in europe to approximately 80 in north america 

  

raw materials and other components used in the manufacture of trucks are purchased from a number of suppliers the company’s daf subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor renault vi for its european lightduty product line pursuant to a joint product development and longterm supply contract sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 5 of consolidated revenues a shortterm loss of supply and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks would not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations however a loss of supply for an extended period of time would either require the company to contract for an alternative source of supply or for the company to manufacture cabs itself other than these components the company is not limited to any single source for any significant component although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products no significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2002 manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly 

  

replacement truck parts are sold and delivered to the company’s independent dealers through the company’s parts distribution network parts are both manufactured by the company and purchased from various suppliers replacement parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery as a percentage of total consolidated net sales and revenues parts sales were 15 in 2002 16 in 2001 and 12 in 2000 

  

there were three other principal competitors in the us and canada class 8 truck market in 2002 the company’s share of that market was 236 of retail sales in 2002 in europe there were five other principal competitors in the commercial vehicle market in 2002 including parent companies to two competitors of the company in the united states the company’s subsidiary daf had a 120 share of the western european heavyduty market and a 86 share of the lightmedium market these markets are highly competitive in price quality and service and paccar is not dependent on any single customer for its sales there are no significant seasonal variations 

  

the peterbilt kenworth daf and foden nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the company’s truck products the company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world 

  

although the company’s truck products are subject to environmental noise and emission controls competing manufacturers are subject to the same controls the company believes the cost of complying with noise and emission controls will not be detrimental to its business

the braden carco and gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products the company has an ongoing program of trademark and trade name protection in all relevant marketing areas
